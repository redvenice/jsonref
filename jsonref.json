There had been around 30 factories across the UK, but now only one remains, the Merrythought factory in Shropshire.The factory has tried to keep its process as traditional as possible and not much has changed since it started making bears in the 1930s. The only difference now is that there is also a mechanised stuffing machine. The workers use a specialist process to manufacture the bear which starts with material selection.Once this has been chosen the arms legs and heads are cut with cutting shapes. The parts then go to the machinist who sews them together so the bears can start to take shape.The limbs of the bear are then attached and the eyes sewn on. The bears are then sent to the stuffing machine to make them extra cuddly.Noses and mouths are then sewn on before a cute smile is stitched onto the bears. The bears are then groomed and brushed before being accesorised with a ribbon around their neck.                          "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/27/12/0012875000000258-6532553-Sir_David_is_pictured_with_gorillas_in_Rwanda_while_making_the_1-a-85_1545912569629.jpg","title":"Sir David Attenborough says hope future Earth","story":"    Sir David Attenborough (pictured  last month) still has \u0027hope\u0027 for the future of the planetSir David Attenborough has insisted he still has \u0027hope\u0027 for the future of the planet - but urged humans to turn their gaze away from themselves.The Blue Planet and Dynasties narrator was asked whether society would exist on Earth in just a few hundred years.\u0027I don\u0027t think it will be uninhabitable,\u0027 the 92-year-old naturalist and broadcaster tells The Arts Hour on BBC radio. \u0027Almost certainly it won\u0027t be as rich as it was.

But pushing less web-savvy customers into using the internet for sensitive financial transactions can put them at risk of fraud. Caroline Abrahams, of the charity Age UK, said: ‘Closing branches cuts costs, but it’s at best an inconvenience and at worst a serious blow for millions of older people who are not online or au fait with mobile banking.’Years of cuts have devastated the network of branches. Britain’s largest banks operated 11,240 branches in the late Nineties – but the top five have just 5,073 between them today. NatWest owner Royal Bank of Scotland shut the most this year, closing 431 – a third of its network. It had nearly 2,300 in 2008, when taxpayers rescued it from collapse with a £46billion bailout.

I prefer not to talk. I don’t speak all day apart for a few words to the sister who does the post.’And that’s how Sister Wendy, who has died aged 88, lived for several decades. Until her passion for art and a chance friendship with Delia Smith — who as well as a cook and fervent Norwich FC fan, is a connoisseur of fine religious writing — led to the publication of some of her works, a move into TV and the launch of a very different Sister Wendy.Thatcher’s legal chief wanted to send the police into...Neil Kinnock demanded a top-spec Rover as his official car...Share this articleHer world-famous alter ego was a cult figure with a high voice, huge glasses and very large teeth who presented series such as Sister Wendy’s Odyssey (1992), Sister Wendy’s Grand Tour (1994) and Sister Wendy’s Story of Painting (1996) which often drew a 25 per cent share of the British viewing audience and saw her hailed by critics as the best talking head on art since Kenneth Clark.Because as well as being exceptionally clever and perceptive, she was a natural broadcaster — needing neither script nor autocue, she became known as ‘One-Take-Wendy’ — and made art fun, inspirational and, for a nun who has sworn a vow of chastity, surprisingly accessible.Take her comments on Botticelli’s Venus: ‘You can’t imagine her doing the washing up.’Or her assessment of Stanley Spencer’s Self-portrait With Patricia Preece. ‘I love all those glistening strands of his hair, and her pubic hair is so soft and fluffy’.          Wendy Beckett was born in Johannesburg on February 25, 1930, the daughter of Aubrey Beckett, a banker-turned-doctor and his wife DorothyNot, perhaps, something you’d expect most Carmelite nuns to say, but Sister Wendy just beamed beatifically with her gentle toothy grin — she once said her teeth were so big, she couldn’t actually close her mouth — and we all loved her.Even more so, when veteran feminist Germaine Greer rubbished the idea of a nun discussing sexuality in art and Beckett replied, quick as a flash, that it wasn’t necessary to experience things to understand them.‘Look at Jane Austen,’ she replied. ‘She was a virgin!’Wendy Beckett was born in Johannesburg on February 25, 1930, the daughter of Aubrey Beckett, a banker-turned-doctor and his wife Dorothy.The 12th-century saint and martyr, Thomas a Becket, was an ancestor and Samuel Beckett the playwright and author a distant cousin. She spent her early childhood in South Africa, before the family moved to Edinburgh to further Aubrey’s medical training.Wendy was a solitary, sickly child with a weak heart, a plain face — ‘I was an extremely unattractive child’ she said — and a name created for the character in Peter Pan that she hated because it sounded too ‘trivial’. She was anything but.Wendy was reading the Scotsman newspaper cover to cover from the age of four she loved school and, later, sang the lead role in all the end of term operettas.          Sister Wendy, pictured, was a distant relative of Irish playwright Samuel BeckettHer connection with God started when she was barely three and eating her Sunday sausages to the strains of a military band in the Meadows area of Edinburgh.‘I realised then that God was there and life was going to be wonderful,’ she said.Her parents were not overtly religious, but the nuns at school inspired her. ‘It was clear to me that this was what people did who wanted to belong completely to God,’ she said.Her faith never wavered and, aged 16, and with her parents blessing (‘It’s just as well you look good in black,’ said her mum ), joined the Sisters of Notre Dame in East Sussex. She took the name Sister Michael and didn’t see her family again for three years.‘After six months, I was given the habit — oh glorious day!’ she said.After four years, she was sent to read English at St Anne’s College, Oxford, where — perhaps aided by the fact she studied in a nuns’ hostel with a vow of silence that forbade her to talk to her fellow students — she came top of her year, won a congratulatory first and was wooed unsuccessfully by J.R.R. Tolkien, the author and Oxford don, who wanted her to pursue a career in academia.But nothing could ert her from her chosen course.So she returned to her Sisters where she hoped to lead a solitary life of contemplation, but was asked to teach, first in Liverpool and later in South Africa.This was her first big test. Because while she adored being a nun and had no problem with the vow of chastity (she never wanted to marry or have children), teaching did not suit her. She found it stressful and oppressive: ‘I was doing something I didn’t like, but I was happy because I was doing what God wanted,’ she said.It was only in 1970, when she started suffering stress-induced epileptic fits that she was allowed to return to England as a Reverend Mother to live a contemplative life of prayer in the teeny second-hand caravan she bought for £50 and parked in the grounds of the Carmelite monastery.There, on top of her meditation and hours of prayers, she started translating Medieval Latin to make a contribution towards the monastery’s overheads.She completed five full volumes before suffering a heart attack. When she recovered she was given permission to write spiritual meditations on contemporary art — her great passion.Some were circulated among a small circle of acquaintances and came to the attention of Delia Smith, a Catholic who became a great friend. Delia took her to art galleries and was so impressed by Wendy’s writing that, in the late Eighties, persuaded the Catholic Herald to publish them.It was during a gallery visit that Wendy was overheard discussing art by a film crew who asked to record her and showed their video to a BBC producer. That was the beginning and Sister Wendy’s Odyssey was an instant hit.She was refreshing and unafraid to speak her mind, whether about Leonardo’s ‘preference for boys’, or denouncing modern British artist Damien Hirst as ‘really pathetic’ and his Turner Prize-winning dead sheep and sharks, as ‘not worth a second look’.However tight the filming schedule, she always had the entitlement to attend Morning Mass built into her BBC contract, but juggling her two lives must have been tricky.Not least, because she embraced a surprising amount of non-sacred behaviour in her showbusiness life that could not have been more removed from a pious hermit.Such as smoked salmon sandwiches at the Ritz, hearty meals at the Savoy Grill and wine in lieu of water whenever she was flagging.She also adored horse racing (studying the form in the Racing Post but never placing a bet) and became a passionate Star Trek fan after coming across it on a hotel bedroom television, loving its ‘serious moral message’.She certainly seemed to love the attention — both on and off the screen — and everywhere she went was accosted by fans who insisted she’d changed their lives.But she yearned for her caravan solitude. ‘I never wanted to do it in the first place. If I’d known how much time it would take, I would never have started it,’ she once said of her media career.She always insisted her fellow nuns felt sorry for her, having to trail around the world with a camera crew. Certainly her Sisters might have blanched at some of her comments.Particularly when it came to gay marriage — she would often question the Catholic Church’s code on sexual ethics as a distraction from the important issues of inclusivity and Godliness.But nothing fazed her. Not fame, not unkind comments about her teeth, nor modern society’s obsessions with sex.Sexual organs, she insisted, were ‘just part of the apparatus God made for us’ and nothing to get embarrassed about.She carried on broadcasting until 2001 — her last series was made for U.S. viewers — but then retreated full time to the calm of her caravan, before it fell to bits and she moved into the monastery.She was not remotely afraid of death. ‘I don’t want to slip across,’ she said. ‘I want to be conscious. I want to say: “This is death and I give it to you, God.” ’"},{"url":null,"title":"Study reveals increase wellbeing people donate time","story":"    Volunteer Jenni Peach is pictured at Southampton Hospital with patient Lizzy earlier this month. So far 27,413 people have pledged a combined total of 1,551,528 hours to the NHS over six monthsBut when they broke the results down into different age groups they discovered the association between volunteering and well-being only became apparent in those over 40.Lead author Dr Faiza Tabassum, of Southampton Statistical Sciences Research Institute, said the findings showed it could help older adults to live longer and healthier lives.She told the Mail: \u0027There are numerous beneficial effects of volunteering on mental well-being such as having a larger social network, more power and prestige and this in turn leads to better physical and mental health.\u0027Volunteering may also provide a sense of purpose, particularly for those people who have lost their earnings, because it regularly helps contribute to the maintenance of social networks and this is especially in the case of older people who often live in isolation. Particularly, with the ageing of the population, it is imperative to develop effective health promotion for this last third of life, so that those living longer are healthier.    The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall gave their backing to the campaign – saying it would make a ‘real difference’. The pair are pictured visiting the Royal London Hospital in June last year\u0027Signing up for the Daily Mail\u0027s volunteering campaign might provide those groups with greater opportunities for beneficial activities and social contacts, which in turn may have protective effects on health status.\u0027The findings should come as good news to thousands of volunteers who have already pledged their time to the Daily Mail\u0027s campaign this Christmas.So far 27,413 people have pledged a combined total of 1,551,528 hours to the NHS over six months. Of these, 15,685 people have pledged three hours a week, while 11,728 have pledged one day a month.\u0027We lost Ivan nearly ten years ago and we miss him...Patients pay tribute to volunteers who help change lives:...Share this articleThe campaign has been backed by health leaders, unions, celebrities and the Prime Minister. TV presenters Claudia Winkleman and Kate Garraway have both stepped in to help at London hospitals.The researchers based their analysis on the British Household Panel Survey, which ran every year from 1991 until 2008, before being incorporated into a much larger survey. Around one in five participants said they had volunteered.Women tended to volunteer more than men, and while almost a quarter of those aged 60 to 74 said they volunteered, this proportion dropped to 17 per cent among the youngest age group.The positive link between volunteering and mental health became apparent at around the age of 40 and peaked between the ages of 76 to 80, where those who gave their time to help others experienced a 12 per cent boost to mental health.  Sybil Kretzmer, wife of the Mail\u0027s legendary former TV critic, Herbert Kretzmer – who as lyricist was a key member of the team that created the global box office hit musical Les Miserables – is a long-time NHS volunteer. Here she urges readers to join her. The trolley dolly The Mail\u0027s marvellous campaign to boost the numbers of volunteers in the NHS is showing thousands of people what I\u0027ve been lucky enough to know my whole life – that volunteering is a joyous experience, full of fun and a sense of fulfilment.Today, I\u0027m a proud Trolley Dolly, wheeling my little mobile \u0027shop\u0027 around the wards. I\u0027ve been doing this for more than 25 years at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust in Chelsea – but I started volunteering long before that.My first job was as a \u0027Candy Striper\u0027, which is what they called junior hospital volunteers back in America where I grew up. I wore the traditional pink-and-white striped pinafore and worked at the children\u0027s hospital where my mother was a paediatrician.            Whatever your skills or experience, you can make a valued and lasting impact. You will join the volunteers working in hospitals or with organisations that support the NHS, such as the Royal Voluntary Service, Marie Curie, British Red Cross, and others. Join us by pledging your time in 2019 at www.hospitalhelpforce.com and clicking on the ‘pledge now’ box. Thank you – and welcome aboard!                                                     Maureen Young, 74, has volunteered at South Shields Hospital for 28 years. With fellow volunteer Sue Goddard she runs the hospital\u0027s League of Friends shop. Maureen, lives in Cleadon, Tyne and Wear, with husband Alan, 76. She says:One of the hospital managers recently said they couldn\u0027t do without us, which was nice. I started volunteering after we returned from eight years\u0027 overseas. I was lonely and bored, then a friend suggested I take over her slot at the hospital shop. I jumped at the idea.I\u0027m in at 3pm- 5pm on Mondays to check the stock and see what needs ordering and then back at 7am on Wednesdays and Fridays for two more three-hour stints.The shop is very well-used and we bank around £3,000 a week. It is entirely staffed by volunteers.Sue Goddard, 64, a retired accountant, who lives with her husband Ken, 68, a retired chief engineer, in Cleadon, has volunteered there for 12 years. Sue says:Initially, I started off doing two hours\u0027 volunteering a week, but once the League of Friends Committee heard about my accountancy skills they asked me to become treasurer. I\u0027m very proud that the shop made £67,000 last year, all of which was spent on hospital equipment.I\u0027ve made some very good friends here including Maureen. We\u0027re very proud of our contribution to the NHS.   We could chat all day Lorraine Pegg, 65, a retired customer services manager, lives in Glamorgan, Wales, and began volunteering as a trolley lady at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital three months ago. Both she and late husband Clive were treated there. She says:The Royal Glam, as I call it, is a really special hospital for me – the care we received there was outstanding.I go in on a Monday morning for four hours – my friend Paul and I go to the wards selling newspapers, magazines, puzzle books, cold drinks, toiletries and healthy snacks. We must cover several miles a day. I think it\u0027s chatting to the patients I like the most – I could stand there and talk all day, whether it\u0027s about Strictly or families and holidays.Volunteering has done wonders for my confidence and it puts life in perspective – when I think \u0027poor me\u0027, I realise there are lots of people worse off and I go home wondering what I was whingeing about.Interviews: Jo Waters      "},{"url":null,"title":"Dramatic explosion electrical plant turns night sky bright blue brings NYC halt","story":"NYC Fire Wire confirmed that a explosion had occurred in the North Queens neighborhood at a Con Edison subplant  The explosion occurred around 9.20pm and no injuries have been reported          The explosion occurred around 9.20pm and no injuries have been reported      The NYPD 114th informed on what was happening with the explosion while the 43rd Precinct had a little fun with the newsThe incident unfolded when Big Apple residents streamed onto Twitter, Instagram and Facebook with their clips and pictures of the blue cloud hovering over the city. Many people were initially confused at what was going on, and questioned whether the lights were coming from a concert venue. Some also reported hearing weird sounds coming from the blast site. The NYPD then put the conspiracy theories to bed and confirmed that the blast had been caused by a power surge at the substation. \u0027Investigating a transformer explosion at Astoria East \u0026amp North Queens Con Ed power plant,\u0027 the NYPD 114th Precint said on Twitter. \u0027Please avoid 20th Ave \u0026amp 31 st.\u0027 NYPD News posted: \u0027ADVISORY: The lights you have seen throughout the city appear to have been from a transformer explosion at a Con Ed facility in Queens. The fire is under control, will update as more info becomes available.

We decided to video chat so we knew we were real people.\u0027I think the whole idea came about because I asked her what she was doing for Christmas.\u0027She told me she thought she was going to a friend\u0027s house but she wasn\u0027t too sure.\u0027I said I\u0027d probably be doing the same as my family are all away in Egypt over Christmas.\u0027I said to her: How about we have our first date on Christmas Day? I\u0027ll come and meet you. She said: That sounds really nice.\u0027Then I had another light bulb moment and suggested: \u0027How about we go away on holiday for our first date?\u0027 Life\u0027s too short.\u0027The subject of marriage came up and Sarah said: I have always thought about going on that program where couples get married at first sight.            Mrs Edwards sits down for a drink after meeting her soon to be husband at Gatwick Airport            The couple, seen here chatting before they boarded the plane, say they couldn\u0027t be better suited to one another\u0027I laughed and said: Let\u0027s get married then. She said: Don\u0027t tempt me. But later that day she called me and said: I\u0027ve bought the wedding dress.\u0027I said: Are you serious? and she told me: If I say something I mean it.\u0027She asked me if I still wanted to get married and I thought: Yeah, why not? I couldn\u0027t imagine anyone being better suited to me.\u0027 It\u0027s absolutely mental.\u0027We just carried on talking and planning and deciding where we could go and get married at such short notice.\u0027We looked at the Caribbean, New York and Las Vegas and Vegas just seemed to stick, it\u0027s the place to run away and elope.\u0027I was supposed to get married in March this year, but everything happens for a reason - I\u0027m a true believer in that.Mrs Edwards has been married before, but it only lasted for six months.

The US Department of Veterans Affairs has expanded its policy to include the devices at private rehabilitation clinics for veterans with spinal cord injuries.The trend is expected to continue in 2019, and other countries are in talks on whether to include the devices in their policies, according to ReWalk.Exoskeletons – powered mechanical frames that wrap around parts or all of the body – have promised superhuman abilities including faster movement and strength, and are tipped as a future mainstay in the military and construction field.Companies developing the products say the technology is more likely to move into mainstream markets through medical use, such as rehabilitation for stroke victims or as a fully automated walking aid for people who have been paralysed.While the kit is expensive for most, the manufacturers hope insurers will increasingly accept the cost as they might with metal hip implants or pacemakers.So far, commercial insurers have done so on a case-by-case basis, and they keep the data private. But ReWalk said its cover came from 38 different providers and said one of the top five insurers in the US was in the final stages of review. It did not name the firm.Larry Jasinski, ReWalk’s CEO, said public and private insurers were increasingly covering the product, either for the entire device or to supply it as a physiotherapy aid.“The German one is the ideal example – they really led the way,” he said by phone. The Dutch and French governments are undergoing policy considerations, as well as New Zealand and Australia, ReWalk says.A significant development came in 2014 when the US Food and Drug Administration approved the ReWalk, affording clout to insurance claims.Others have refused to cover the cost but at least one claimant, a surgeon with a spinal injury, had a success when an external independent review overturned his health plan’s initial denial and deemed the suit medically necessary.Indego, another exoskeleton made in the US, said in an email that it was also covered by some policies in the US and Europe. RSA Insurance Group in the UK has been looking at how providing exoskeletons might, in fact, reduce total costs as the rehabilitation success means patients might be out of care soon, helping claimants to get self-dependent much faster.Jasinski said ReWalk was now working on a lighter, cheaper design that would not fully support a human body but still provide assistance. Unlike the sturdy, metallic exoskeleton, the “soft-suit” will be made of fabric, small motors and cables and is designed for people who retain a degree of mobility but need extra help.“For someone who has had a stroke, or somebody who has had multiple sclerosis, or someone who has Parkinson’s, they can actually still stand,” he said. “They don’t need a device to hold them up, they just need assistance to walk. It’s roughly one-seventh of weight and size of the current product and one-seventh of the cost.”The suit, currently named Restore, could be on the market in mid-2019 the company said it would be covered in clinics once available.“Frankly, from a financial point of view, it’s more than likely our other products are going to have more to do with our financial success, even if they are not quite as dramatic a product,” Jasinski added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e93239be1c715706be64d1fd4b54ddb08377d116/0_112_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=741cd28a6e937ec34ada56644e195301","title":"asylum seekers right to work awaiting claims","story":"At this time of celebration and giving, people awaiting asylum claims can’t even work to survive. That has to change • John Sentamu is the archbishop of YorkBetween Christmas and the new year, the church calendar recalls an event that is starkly at odds with the celebrations of hope that surround it. On 28 December, Holy Innocents’ Day, we recall Herod’s massacre of young children, which, in Matthew’s Gospel, the infant Jesus only escaped by his parents fleeing for protection in Egypt. How long they stayed there nobody knows, but it is likely that Joseph, with his skills as a carpenter, would have found ways to earn a living while they were there.After fleeing their homes in search of safety, today’s asylum seekers also find themselves in a new and unfamiliar country and many will have spent this holiday thousands of miles from their families, friends and support networks. Any hope for what the new year may bring is often tainted by the anxiety that comes with waiting for a decision on an asylum claim. The support they are given by the Home Office of just over £5 a day to meet all their essential living needs will need to stretch even further in this period. With children out of school, local drop-ins and support services mostly closed, the long empty days are difficult to fill. The experience of poverty is most stark during this time of celebration and giving.But it doesn’t have to be this way. I have been heartened to see a growing chorus of voices making the case for granting asylum seekers the right to work over the past few months. That includes voices from across the political spectrum – because regardless of one’s views on asylum policy, common sense tells us that working can be a solution to poverty. This government accepts that premise, but currently denies the right to work to those who are seeking asylum.I believe it’s time for this to change, and I am not alone. Recent polls have shown that there is widespread public support for allowing asylum seekers to work and support themselves. This comes as no surprise, as a reform to the policy would benefit the UK economy by creating savings and bringing in tax revenues. It would help new refugees to integrate more effectively, as long periods outside of the labour market inevitably take a toll on self-confidence, skills and employability. Perhaps most importantly, it would give back dignity to people seeking asylum in what is otherwise a draining and degrading system.Working with people in the asylum system over the last few decades, I never fail to be impressed by the breadth of skills and experiences that they have brought to this country. I have come across people who have worked as doctors, shepherds, interpreters, engineers, seamstresses and mechanics – all united by their experiences of seeking sanctuary in the UK.I heard recently of Faith, (not her real name) from Zimbabwe, living in north-east England, who waited for a decision on her asylum claim for 11 years. She had been a nurse in her own country, and was desperate to get back to doing the job she loved. Not being allowed to work had a profoundly damaging effect on Faith. She would sit at home getting very depressed, unable to make friends, because going anywhere cost money she didn’t have. She felt her training and skills were being wasted. This had an impact on her self-confidence, and eventually upon her mental health. How different it would have been had she been permitted to find employment and thereby contribute to the society where she had sought refuge.Listening to asylum seekers’ stories of persecution, displacement and loss, I hear the noble traits of bravery, determination and endurance. It is in no one’s interest to have these iniduals forced into inactivity. I have no doubt that their contributions to our society would be significant – if we let them. Despite the inevitable preoccupations of parliament at this time, I hope and pray that among the new year resolutions made by politicians of all sides this winter, they will find time to follow through on this commitment, and enable asylum seekers to work, giving them the dignity of being able to contribute to society by paying tax, reducing the burden on the state, and benefiting local communities up and down this country with their skills.• John Sentamu is the archbishop of York"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/768b735f5f9b15118245ac1e563b98976a04f800/0_177_4064_2438/master/4064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc8ede172d6aa03cacaf4df9faf73371","title":"high streets church experience economy","story":"I have just had my first Alexa experience. It was in Los Angeles and it was eerie and rather charming. There is no doubt “she” vastly simplifies a range of trivial tasks. To the lonely, she is apparently comforting, like a pet, and with “empathy” increasingly built in, is growing ever more so. But she is clearly driving a nail ever further into the coffin of the classic concept of shopping. Who needs to drive through hellish traffic to a bleak mall when not just your laptop but “Alexa, get me …” will do the trick?All this has come to pass. Spending on bars and restaurants, live entertainment, exercise and, above all, travel continues to soar. So, too, has the money going into simply meeting people, the so-called Tinder economy. The “power of live” is at the core of the post‑digital world. But what has not happened is any change in the physical framework, literally the streets and buildings, where such experiences used to occur. The high street, the traditional forum of the community, is losing its role.I cannot rid my mind of its predecessor in this role, the parish church. These magnificent buildings litter every town and village, most of the time lying gaunt and unused. They are now being joined by the shuttered grocer and the defunct hardware store as symbols of a lost social cohesion. If Thomas Gray were to write his churchyard elegy today – “and leaves the world to darkness and to me” – he would surely move down the road to the high street.Belonging, the current BBC Radio 4 series by Douglas Alexander, is showing how this declining sense of locality is changing more than the economics of a place. It is becoming political. By sucking the oxygen out of community, it sends people retreating to their residual identities. There they are spared any obligation to get on with their neighbours, to socialise and compromise. Hence the Brexit obsession with “taking back control”.It is plain that the social evils now being so intensely debated result from this disintegration of community, and the evils of isolation, homelessness, mental illness and gang culture. The concept of local discipline is dying, as is that of a local leader. How many people truly feel their own experience is reflected by the cosiness of the Archers? Alexa is the new Ambridge.Until a century ago, the church was the fulcrum of such a community. It was the fount of education, welfare and local participation, the rock on which the ideal of localism rested. That rock was replaced by all that was meant by the high street, a congeries of town halls, shops, clinics, banks, police stations, libraries. It is vanishing.There is no loss of vitality in the desire to congregate. The traffic on the M1 or a Los Angeles freeway is craving somewhere to go and something to do – the so-called “doing-not-buying economy”. But the congregation it seeks is one of brief affinities, not lasting communities. It is anonymous and dispersed.Since there is no point in defying change, the question is whether such activities can be localised. As the acquisition of goods and services goes online, can local experiences replace them? Since the essence of human experience is contact with other people, the answer must surely be yes, if we help it to happen.The liveliest high streets I know are lined with coffee bars, beauty parlours, gyms and travel agents. The most celebrated “high street” in Los Angeles, Abbot Kinney Street, is just such a place – busy with health clubs, art galleries and now a cannabis boutique. Britain’s high streets are increasingly “alternative”, the charity shops in reality recycling plants. Some people even claim to take more goods to shops than they buy from them.With painful slowness, churches are emerging as secular meeting places. Thirty-five are already listed as post offices, others as bookshops, day centres and pick-up points for online shopping. They are starting to fill gaps left by the departure of other local services. One charity has turned a church in Ipswich into the local psychotherapy centre, an “experience” function that might be said to echo its original one.A high street is a community working. But government must be hypersensitive to its purpose. These places face an existential crisis. It is unbelievable that Whitehall can bias both taxation and planning decisions against them, in favour of housing. Houses will never build coherent societies without high streets. The issue is the weight democracy attaches to locality as against nationality. As the former House of Representatives speaker Tip O’Neill said, all politics is local. But so is all community."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6f706cfabc8e41547099e92c4d10fce3bb5078d/0_48_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb65b44a6ca5fde13c7d1d795e6d8c72","title":"how i found light at the end of the very dark tunnel that acne plunged me into","story":"The condition and its after-effects have shaped my character in ways I’m only now beginning to understand. Mostly positiveIt’s usually special and a bit thrilling to be told that you’re one in 200,000.But when I turned 17 and my cystic acne hit like a category 5 cyclone, I felt like I’d been cursed.After initially informing me of the rarity of this painful, disfiguring, and undesirably rare skin disease, my dermatologist helpfully added that I was the worst case he’d seen in two decades.I knew nothing about acne before then, beyond it being a temporary affliction that could be cleared up with a greasy ointment or maybe antibiotics.Zits were no big deal, or so I thought.Little did I know the symptomatic hell that was about to be unleashed on my body in the next six months and beyond.I tell my story now, more than 30 years after the fact, not to garner pity or sympathy I moved through that stage long ago. Maybe it’s to help me understand it better, or show others that there’s light at the end of the very dark tunnel that cystic acne plunges you into.According to the Medical Journal of Australia, acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit resulting from androgen-induced increased sebum production altered keratinisation bacterial colonisation of hair follicles on the face, neck, chest and back by Propionibacterium acnes and an inflammatory response in the skin.MJA notes that: “Scarring that occurs from acne, particularly severe acne, can persist a lifetime and have long lasting psychosocial effects. Depression, social isolation and suicidal ideation are frequent comorbidities in acne.” Gulp.Acne is one of the most common skin conditions in Australia. A smaller slice of the population develops cystic acne, the most severe form of acne vulgaris marked by large, inflamed lesions that form deep within the skin and can result in painful, large bumps visible from the surface.I was unlucky enough to fall victim to the most severe form of the worst aberration of acne. Both the condition and its after-effects have shaped my character in ways I’m only now beginning to understand. Mostly positive. But more of that later.None of this impending destruction was visible on my skin when I was going through puberty. As with many teenagers, I had only mild acne develop when I was 16. In fact, my face and other parts of my body were unmarked by even tiny pimples.That changed quickly. In the winter of 1984, I began to get subsurface lumps on my back without even going through the blackhead or whitehead phase. I can’t remember much about the first time around. All I recall that it came and went pretty quickly and went away mostly of its own accord.Things were a bit different in around March 1985. Again, it erupted from a standing start. Out of nowhere began a steady march of lumps around the size of a 20-cent piece sprouting from my body.First across my back, then my neck, then my face. It didn’t take long, maybe a couple of weeks or so, before I started turning into a real freak show. My back and halfway down my arms became a bloody, pustulent, seething mass of scabs and infection.When most people hear the word “acne”, they think of a small, sporadic problem that causes minor irritation before things return to normal once puberty ends. But my case was markedly different.I soon sought coping strategies. After a couple of days of my white school shirt turning red and black, I started wearing white undershirts so the dried blood and pus wouldn’t show through.Every afternoon when school ended, I went straight to the boarding school’s shower block so I could remove my undershirt – and with it, half the skin off my back. The back of my neck was similarly afflicted, with my hair sticking to the wounds.At night, I found it impossible to find uninterrupted sleep. The slightest movement would put pressure on my skin and wake me up with the searing pain. I was forced to use my recesses and lunchtimes to grab short naps, otherwise I would’ve fallen asleep in class.For a few months, I kept a dream diary to chronicle my descent into nocturnal madness. But eventually the images and scenarios that I faithfully recorded became too disturbing. I burnt it symbolically in the hope that it would purge me of my nightmares. It didn’t. Then, the devastation began to spread across my face like a landscape scorched with napalm. While I had a number of isolated outbreaks across my cheeks, the worst reserved itself for my right-hand jawline, where a number of cysts merged to form an almighty abscess which was probably visible from space. One day, when I was lining up to go into English literature class, another boy accidentally bumped me with his shoulder, breaking the surface of my abscess and causing it to bleed. I removed my white jumper vest to stem the bleeding.By the time I had reached the school hospital, the vest was entirely soaked with blood. The nurse tried to patch me up with stitches, but because the skin was like tissue paper, she couldn’t do much. For the rest of the day, I had to wear a big gauze patch and a bandage around my head and jaw like a gout patient.In my sleep-deprived haze, I struggled to get from boarding school to the city once a week to endure a session with the old-school dermatologist to whom I had been referred. He couldn’t do much aside from squeeze a whole load of sebum out of the blackheads and whiteheads on my back among the worst of the infection.He used to show me the end results as if it constituted some form of victory over the hideous disease. But I remained uncured. No wide-spectrum antibiotics, sulphur ointment, or topical creams made any difference. And worse still, my condition just seemed to be getting worse.It was at this point that I contemplated killing myself. Yet that contemplation passed soon enough. I decided that if it hadn’t killed me yet, I wouldn’t finish the job myself.The daily mocking and torments from my fellow students didn’t help, but it was nothing compared to the unending physical pain that felt like it was corroding my very being. I felt like I was slowly melting away.At the same time, my school grades and extra-curricular activities were suffering accordingly. In hindsight, it seems ridiculous to contemplate that I was attempting my Higher School Certificate – now the VCE – in the midst of all this.It was perhaps unsurprising that the private school I attended was generally unsympathetic, contrary to their claimed ethos of “pastoral care”. I recall clearly the deputy principal telling me and then my parents that the disease was a punishment from God for being a miscreant. He’s dead now. Perhaps in God’s care.I had to give up playing rugby for obvious reasons and spent a lot of time in the makeup chair before taking the stage for the lead role in the school play. I stemmed the occasional flow of blood with a handkerchief while playing the narrator in Thornton Wilder’s Our Town.My interaction with the opposite sex was distorted by my own perception that any half-smart girl wouldn’t want to come within five metres of me. Yet through a miracle, I attracted some attention. This included a school dance where I got along just fine with a gorgeous girl who I later found out was school captain. Later I also heard she was heartbroken when I refused to return her numerous calls, preferring the misery of my own company.And then, in the winter of 1985, my salvation arrived – a drug called Roaccutane. It belonged to a group of medicines called retinoids. They work by reducing the amount of the oily substance – or sebum – made by glands in the skin, reducing bacteria and inflammation, and opening clogged pores.On the whole, it was a pretty vicious treatment. The list of side effects read like a piano roll. In addition to drying up your mucous membranes, the Roaccutane also dried out your skin, mouth, eyes, lips, and nose. It caused itching, nosebleeds, cracked skin, joint and back pain, dizziness and drowsiness. Oh, and nervousness, and changes in fingernails and toenails. To add insult to injury, the Roaccutane actually made the acne get worse before it finally started to improve.Before I started on the drug, I had to sign a document confirming that I wasn’t pregnant and didn’t plan to get knocked up. The drug was known to cause spontaneous and immediate abortion. The Department of Health also had to give special approval for me to take it in the quantities necessary to have an effect.But Jesus, Mary and Joseph … the drug worked.After several months of intense treatment, my acne cleared up completely. But my scarring was immense. Halfway down both arms and my entire upper back and shoulders looked like I’d gone ten rounds with a blowtorch. And my face was a real mess. When I began interviewing people in my early career as a cadet journalist, they couldn’t stop staring. No one ever asked why I was so scarred.At this point, I took up my parents’ offer to fund plastic surgery. The operation was a success, but I went into full hermit mode for six weeks after, hiding indoors because my new skin was too delicate to expose to the sun. My face was as pink as a newborn and about as tender. The doctor didn’t even attempt to touch my back. All my flat scarring meant I didn’t have enough skin on my body to trouble with a graft. When it was all over, my physical appearance was closer to normal. Only in certain light did one side of my face appear to have lost an argument with a spiked mace.Over time, I became proud that I had endured such pain, and to this day the knowledge that I had come back from such a dark place gives me untold resilience and strength.I have sought explanations for why this happened to me but no answers have been forthcoming. Hyperactive lymph glands, rapid metabolic rate, and so-called “tubercular taint” (left in the DNA from an ancestor who had tuberculosis) have all been proffered as potential factors in the viciousness and rapid onset of my cystic acne.If there were any other positives to emerge from this experience, it was my attitude towards superficial appearance and vanity. My trauma had shown me that real beauty lies far beneath the skin, and that people can be at their cruellest when taunting others who don’t measure up to their own standards of physical normality.It was some time ago that I gave up on quaint notions of redemption and being punished for sins in past lives. Instead, something that a mate recently posted on social media seemed to resonate.The Japanese art and philosophy of kintsugi – translated as “gold scars” – tells us that broken objects are not something to hide, but instead to display with pride. Repairing broken ceramics gives a new lease of life to pottery that in turn becomes even more refined and unique because of its “scars”.Kintsugi suggests that we should try to repair objects, and by extension ourselves, because sometimes in doing so we obtain even more valuable things.That was my choice. To move through the darkness into light, and in doing so become whole again and stronger at the broken places.• In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

The evidence strongly suggests otherwise. The Downing Street Declaration of December 1993 and other seminal documents that advanced the peace process refer explicitly to the EU context. Moreover, beyond such formal acknowledgment, the impact of Europe in bringing peace to our small island was profound and manifold. That it is often taken for granted does not mean that it should be taken as read.There are numerous ways in which the EU contributed to reconciliation between our islands and created the context for bringing an end to the years of tragedy in Northern Ireland.The joint accession of the UK and Ireland to the EU in 1973 fundamentally improved political relations between us. For the first time in history, the EU provided Ireland and the UK with a structured context for our relationship.Our shared membership helped to nurture many important and lasting personal friendships. Before EU membership, such friendships at political and official level between our islands hovered between minimal and nonexistent.The experience of addressing the important issues arising in EU negotiations then taught us how much we actually have in common and how much we can achieve together when we work towards common goals. It also helped us to recognise that, even when we disagree, we share a way of doing business.By its very nature, the EU was an important reminder of the potential for reconciliation between peoples, as John Hume always emphasised.It ingrained in us the habit and language of compromise.It taught us to live with shared and overlapping identities.The EU, reflecting the generosity of our partners and their taxpayers, has provided financial support over many years for peace in Northern Ireland. Although I doubt it has been mentioned even once in the British media, the EU has promised in the Brexit negotiations to continue to provide such support after the UK leaves.Above all, along with the US, the EU provided the wider context for reconciliation.As Monty Python’s John Cleese might say: “All right, I grant you all that. But apart from that, what else has the EU done for Northern Ireland?”The wider context provided by the EU is particularly crucial. I can testify to one illustration of that. I was Ireland’s ambassador to the EU when Ian Paisley took the historic but sensitive step of entering government with Martin McGuinness. Paisley immediately contacted the Irish authorities to ask if the president of the EU commission, José Manuel Barroso, could visit Belfast as soon as possible. I conveyed the request and Barroso, who was on a visit to Washington, readily agreed and flew to Belfast the following day. Many will recall the photos of Paisley and McGuinness smiling and laughing together the day after they entered office. Probably few will recall that Barroso was also in those photographs. Paisley had had the political intelligence to realise that, even visually, the wider EU context was crucial.At a recent Oxford seminar which I attended on the origins of the peace process, British and Irish veterans of the Northern Ireland negotiations offered their personal insights into the complexities of those negotiations. It occurred to me that these insights and their legacy could provide much needed guidance on Brexit.There is a crying need today for the statesmanship which came to characterise the peace process. There is a need for political leadership with a similar sense of history, which understands that the stakes are far more important than the next soundbite or tabloid headline or internal party bloodletting. There is an urgent need for people who can handle infinite complexity who understand that compromise is not a dirty word and that diplomacy is not surrender.The experience of those peace process negotiators also has important lessons for the future friendship between Britain and Ireland, a friendship which will remain important whatever happens. If Brexit goes ahead, we will need negotiators for a new era who can make friendships when the winds are adverse, not just when they are benign. Above all, despite the coarse rhetoric used by some in recent weeks, we must maintain the mutual respect which has now for so long characterised the Anglo-Irish relationship.• Bobby McDonagh was Ireland’s ambassador to the UK from 2009-2013"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d63458d444ceb86f5fb5a0f9ebaa022a0418eeb2/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d668ca7ec18b56c736325267a74e356","title":"10 best world music albums 2018","story":"The year’s varied highlights included Palestinian hip-hop from 47Soul, dramatic bass music from Soweto newcomers BCUC, the Tunisian electronica of Ammar 808 and Vodou protest music from Moonlight BenjaminThis year’s most exhilarating newcomers hailed from Soweto. BCUC’s album Emakhosini offers a dramatic, often intimidating blend of ancient South African chants, township influences and contemporary bass riffs matched against Kgomotso Mokone’s cool, soulful vocals. In a great year for female singers, Mali’s Fatoumata Diawara proved with her second solo album Fenfo that she can cover anything from Afro-pop to blues and soul, and is surely capable of far more. The best north African music came from Tunisia, on Ammar 808’s album Maghreb United, which mixed regional styles with a blend of local instruments and percussion-heavy electronica, with exhilarating results.Across the African diaspora, two unexpected delights came from expat Haitian singer-songwriters reworking the music of their homeland. On Siltane, the powerful, soulful Moonlight Benjamin treated new and old Vodou songs to a blues-rock guitar backing, while on Radyo Siwèl, guitarist Mélissa Laveaux used much the same technique to revive protest songs from the era of the US invasion. Elsewhere in the Caribbean, Trinidadian veteran Calypso Rose included an inspired treatment of Nat King Cole’s Calypso Blues on So Calypso!There was more excellent and varied music from the Middle East, where strong Palestinian releases ranged from the electronic hip-hop and traditional dance music on 47Soul’s Balfron Promise to the intricate oud playing on Le Trio Joubran’s The Long March. From Istanbul, there was folk-rock and electronica on Gaye Su Akyol’s Istikrarli Hayal Hakikattir, an experimental set influenced both by Nirvana and Turkish folk music, that switched from pained, personal balladry to a mighty, timely plea for tolerance.The best European and UK releases included Mari Kalkun’s Ilmamotsan, a gently mesmerising set from Estonia, and Kulku, from the British-Finnish-Armenian band SANS. And then there was Soar, the exquisite second album from the Welsh harpist Catrin Finch and Senegalese kora virtuoso Seckou Keita. Inspired by the ospreys that travel freely between west Africa and Wales (in contrast to humans), it included a memorable excerpt from Bach’s Goldberg Variations. Themes of migration and freedom were also central to Flight, an exuberant return from Afro Celt Sound System. Then there’s one I missed: Susheela Raman’s Ghost Gamelan, featuring the unearthly sounds of a Javanese gamelan band.The one downer was what Peter Gabriel called an “alarming” rise in the number of great international artists refused visas to perform in the UK, even for major events like Womad – a situation that could become even worse with Brexit.

First, an actor. That worked out. She got an agent at six was in Star Wars at 13 and Pirates of the Caribbean at 17 won an Oscar nomination for Pride and Prejudice at 20 and another, 10 years later, for The Imitation Game. Second, a man. That’s still a work in progress.“I remember everything about that feeling,” she says, now 33, folded up on a sofa in a London hotel. A big blue frock juts out from under her like a nest. “That girls grew into men, and that’s what I was going to be.” Toddler logic, she admits goodness knows what boys became. “Maybe it was that the girls were the most powerful in the playground. They were in charge and, obviously, the men were in charge outside. So clearly that’s where I was going. Only, of course it wasn’t.”Knightley scrunches her face: a chipmunk photobombing a supermodel. Still, she was a grade-A tomboy: no skirts, leading a protest at school until girls were allowed to play football. At 11, she was “obsessed by The Godfather. I wanted to be Al Pacino and that’s where I was heading. The great parts are the guys’ parts. You don’t want to be the pretty girl in the corner or the mum being lovable and supportive. Of course, when you grow up you are, but you still want to have the adventures.”Knightley’s entire career, from ball-busting breakthrough in Bend it Like Beckham to cross-dressing, trans-romancing Colette in her new film, has been an attempt to have adventures her younger self would respect. To explore if not what it would be like to be a man, then certainly “the masculine side of the female, stuck in the dresses and makeup. Almost every character I’ve played has tried to break out of that image of femininity. That’s why I like period films, because it’s such an overt cage you put the woman in. That’s always something I’ve really identified with. I feel like I sit somewhere else.”I look quizzical. “I’ve never wanted a penis,” she clarifies. “Apart from to piss up a tree. Being able to do that standing up: so convenient. You can just whip it out and whatever. But the idea of something so vulnerable swinging between my legs, I think I’m all right without.”Generally, it can be tricky encouraging stars away from unpacking art to chatting genitals. With Knightley, it’s like turning on a tap. I don’t think I’ve ever met someone simultaneously so famous and so garrulous (she’s also bracingly sweary). Or perhaps it’s something only those who have been A-listers more than half their life already can get away with.A few days after we meet, Knightley appears on Ellen DeGeneres’s chatshow to promote The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, and mentions she has banned her young daughter, Edie (with husband James Righton, frontman of the new-rave band Klaxons), from watching the Disney classics Cinderella and A Little Mermaid because of their dodgy feminist messages. Twitter entered white-heat mode. Thinkpieces were spewed out like ticker tape. Presumably Disney – which also made The Nutcracker, which has since flopped – weren’t thrilled. But when asked about it again a fortnight later, instead of calming the waters, she went in with a whisk: doubling down on her argument with some PhD-level Disney princess knowledge.Still, she says in December when we speak again on the phone, being up for a fight doesn’t mean you want a punch. “I thought I was just being perky in an interview. My God, people feel really strongly. Don’t fuck with Cinderella. Her fans will end you.”Anyway, back to Colette. It’s the latest film from Wash Westmoreland, who made Still Alice with his husband, Richard Glatzer, before the latter died of ALS (also known as motor neurone disease) a fortnight after Julianne Moore’s Oscar win for lead actress. They co-wrote this one, too, and it’s clearly the work of a couple: intimate, barbed and funny. The plot revolves around Colette and her literary entrepreneur husband Willy (Dominic West), who pass off her novels as his, until Colette starts resenting the fiction, and Willy’s hypocritical jealousy over her affairs with a Louisiana heiress (Poldark’s Eleanor Tomlinson) and a gender-fluid aristocrat (Denise Gough) who never removes her suit. By and large, men fare badly. But Willy is, like Colette, finely drawn, charming for all his ludicrosity. In one scene, he wins his wife back by explaining that men are the weaker sex, slaves to their biology, ergo his endless shagging.“The Weaker Sex” is also the withering title of an essay Knightley wrote for a collection called Feminists Don’t Wear Pink And Other Lies, published in October. At the time, it caused a stink for what some perceived as an attack on the Duchess of Cambridge for looking glam hours after the birth of her daughter. Was she surprised? “The whole essay was about the silencing of women’s experience. So it’s interesting that’s exactly what happened from certain media outlets. They turned a moment of empathy from one body to another around to say: she’s shaming her.”Yet women seemed just as mean as men. “Yeah, that’s interesting. Internalised misogyny? I’m not criticising that. All of us respond to and survive within the culture in the way that we can. But I think we need to have a big look at ourselves.”Indeed. The duchess section is actually the blandest part of a blazing manifesto that starts with Knightley’s vagina splitting, swiftly brings in blood, poo, cracked nipples and incontinence pads, then closes with a broadside against male colleagues:“They tell me what it is to be a woman. Be nice, be supportive, be pretty but not too pretty, be thin but not too thin, be sexy but not too sexy, be successful but not too successful. … But I don’t want to flirt and mother them, flirt and mother, flirt and mother. I don’t want to flirt with you because I don’t want to fuck you, and I don’t want to mother you because I am not your mother. … I just want to work, mate. Is that OK? Talk and be heard, be talked to and listen. Male ego. Stop getting in the way.”The essay, says Knightley, was “just sort of vomited out”, submitted in a “fuck it” moment, published “because we have to harness this moment in time and use our voices to keep the conversation going. Because we’re saddled with a system built on inequality,” she says, “progress is going to be slow and painful and uncomfortable. But I want to make sure I’m not raising my daughter in fear of the whole other half of the human race. Just as it’s important to raise boys seeing the whole of a woman’s experience, not simply one aspect of femininity. Otherwise, how can you respect it?”The core problem, she reckons, is that the voices of a generation of women are lost to childcare. This means – to bring it back to straying Willy – that “we all empathise with men hugely because, culturally, their experience is so explored. We know so many aspects of even male sexuality. But we don’t feel like men can say: ‘Yes, I understand what you’re talking about because I’ve got this wealth of art and film and theatre and TV from your point of view.’”So if women don’t come on flirty or maternal, she thinks, some men get stumped. “Before motherhood, you’re sexy, but if we talk about the whole vagina-splitting thing then that’s terrifying there’s no sex there, so what we do is go into the virgin-mother retrofit, that’s nice and safe. The problem with those two images is I think very few women actually identify with them. Women are meant to play the flirt or the mother in order to get their voice heard. I can’t. It makes me feel sick.””On set, she was informed by a male director – not Westmoreland – exactly what she was: not passive-aggressive, but openly aggressive. Her eyes pop recalling the shock. “I thought that was extraordinary. I hadn’t raised my voice, I hadn’t sworn, I simply disagreed with a point. And this was someone I liked.”Look back over Knightley’s previous press and what sticks out – more, even, than her habit of irritating people by dint of crimes including her looks and niceness – is her composure. She has always seemed poised, someone of conviction and confidence, if not arrogance. Bumblings have been low-key she has kept it together.Not without effort, it turns out. Earlier this year, she told the Hollywood Reporter that she had had a breakdown aged 22, following five years of endless exposure. She didn’t leave the house for three months. A therapist said she was her first client who wasn’t being paranoid when she worried about people following her. She needed hypnotherapy to feel able to walk the Baftas red carpet for Atonement in 2007.The other reason Knightley speaks her mind is it would never occur to her not to. The perception is that she hails from high privilege. But her schooling was bog-standard her parents – playwright Sharman Macdonald and actor Will Knightley – thespy, but also relatively radical leftwing types. Not quite hippies, says Knightley, but as close as Teddington in south-west London probably got. She says she hadn’t realised how lucky she was to be raised by a father who loved the fact his wife often earned more than he did.In the film she is currently shooting, Misbehaviour, she plays Sally Alexander, a women’s libber among those who invaded the stage at Miss World 1970 with football rattles and flour bombs. Watch footage of the real Alexander today and you could be watching an older Knightley. These are her people: arty but determined, polite but forthright.And that, perhaps, is why Knightley’s pronouncements don’t – for me at least – stick in the throat. So much political rhetoric trotted out by film stars smacks of the bandwagon: rote homilies, recited without too much consideration.Knightley sings from a more sophisticated hymn sheet. Take Miss World. Plainly, she’s not a fan: “I’d never seen a beauty competition before but you think, wow this is really out there! The way they turn their arses and the cameras panning up and down. The way society as a whole goes: ‘Oh no, this is fine.’”But while the actions of Alexander et al were “amazingly brave”, she’s not sure she would have done the same, because the contestants felt they were being attacked. “That was unfair. And having been on stage, if something like that happened it would be utterly terrifying.”She is even measured when I asked about Harvey Weinstein, giving “credit where credit’s due he was very good at getting independent cinema an audience”. They had most contact around the time of The Imitation Game, when she wasn’t remotely in need of patronage, and pregnant – both reasons he didn’t try it on, she thinks. “And maybe he just didn’t fancy me, could be as simple as that.”She swears ignorance over his alleged assaults. “I absolutely knew he was a womaniser, because you could see it. But I thought that was consensual, and I’d never heard he’d raped anybody. Everyone knew he was a bully because he would scream and shout. But it wasn’t obvious he was doing what he was doing with the bathrobe and the massage and the pot plant. The pot plant!”Such as? “About their sexuality, how they see us, exactly what they want. It’s a really tricky discussion but I don’t know how we move forward without engaging men. And you can’t hate them if you’re trying to do that.” A pause, another grimace: scepticism made flesh. “Also: they’re nice. I know some really lovely ones.”• Colette is released on 12 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a222e46fea108bbcef1f80063787d384ee0cd16/64_140_3048_1829/master/3048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86ba0e9e69c8e6c932ccb819a231b502","title":"southampton west ham united premier league match report","story":"Southampton’s revival under Ralph Hasenhüttl was brought to an abrupt halt on a night when Felipe Anderson delivered the sort of performance that suggests West Ham United have a new hero in their ranks. The Brazilian was outstanding as he scored twice in six minutes to turn this game on its head and extinguish any hopes Southampton had of putting some distance between themselves and the relegation zone.Nathan Redmond’s early second-half goal – bundled over the line with his arm – put Southampton ahead but that lead lasted for 168 seconds. Felipe Anderson scored only once in his opening 10 Premier League games after joining from Lazio in a club-record £36m deal but the 25-year-old has been making up for lost time since. He hauled West Ham level here with a terrific shot from just outside the area and then made it seven goals in his last nine matches by finishing off a superb counterattack with a beautifully placed winner.That double blow left Southampton in a state of shock from which they never really recovered. Hasenhüttl, who had won two of his previous three games in charge, admitted his players looked tired in the closing half an hour and also expressed his frustration with the way that “old behaviours were seen today”. Southampton have lost more points from a winning position this season than any other Premier League club, which is why the manner of this defeat felt all too familiar.West Ham, on paper, were welcome opponents. Manuel Pellegrini has a major injury crisis on his hands – he is without 10 senior players and was able to name only six substitutes here – yet the visitors looked the more accomplished side throughout. Declan Rice was particularly impressive in the centre of midfield in the first half, when Southampton faded after Danny Ings stabbed an early chance into the side-netting, while Felipe Anderson became more and more influential for West Ham and was unlucky not to finish the game with a hat-trick.Southampton, however, were entitled to question whether his second goal should have come about. Television replays showed Rice wrestling with Jan Bednarek in the West Ham area in the lead-up to the breakaway that ended with Michail Antonio releasing Felipe Anderson clear on goal. “I haven’t seen it. But I heard it,” Hasenhúttl said, when asked about the penalty claim. “Maybe with VAR it can be a penalty for us. It could make a big difference for us in that moment. But we try to look at ourselves first and find the mistakes we made.”The Southampton manager was particularly disappointed in that respect. “We didn’t have our best evening too many players didn’t perform like they did maybe last week or the week before,” he said. “And you see what I tell my players, that it’s the Premier League and, if you make easy mistakes like we did on the second goal, then you don’t deserve to win. The first goal we could also defend better. It was too easy how we gave our 1-0 lead away.”Pellegrini, in contrast, could reflect on a hugely satisfying night, especially given that long list of absentees. West Ham have now won five out of their last six league games and they are up to ninth in the table, with 27 points on the board – not bad for a team that have been playing catch-up after losing their first four fixtures.Felipe Anderson is clearly their star attraction, although Pellegrini was guarded in his praise. “I think he will continue improving,” West Ham’s manager said. “He still loses too many balls, maybe because he must understand the Premier League is difficult if you keep the ball in your feet. But in every game he makes important plays and that’s the most great thing that he has.”The match had been a slowburner and precious little happened before the break, apart from Lucas Pérez squandering a golden chance for West Ham. It came to life after the interval, however, when Redmond scored within five minutes of the restart. Lukasz Fabianski initially denied the Southampton winger, who was played onside by Grady Diangana, and the West Ham goalkeeper also thwarted Oriol Romeu. Redmond refused to give up, though, and controversially nudged the ball over the line.Felipe Anderson then equalised with a 22-yard shot that flashed inside Alex McCarthy’s near post. If McCarthy’s positioning was questionable on that occasion, there was nothing Southampton’s goalkeeper could do to prevent West Ham’s second. Antonio tore upfield and picked out Felipe Anderson, who took a couple of touches to steady himself before steering a rising shot into the far corner. Although Fabianski had earlier denied Stuart Armstrong and later kept out Mario Lemina’s effort, Pérez and Felipe Anderson both had chances to add a third for West Ham."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c37864de026c48d31a703c4778c208dabf36a02/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70c6ff2e33df1ebd8ead74bbead06b56","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Things could get worse for Manchester City before they get better and Kyle Walker-Peters poses a few questions for Mauricio PochettinoMaurizio Sarri started the festive period by publicly guaranteeing that Ruben Loftus-Cheek would get some significant first-team action before the new year festivities die down. “We have to play every three days so one match he will be in the starting XI for sure,” he said. On Boxing Day Sarri left Loftus-Cheek out of the squad entirely for the victory over Watford, but if the player himself could have chosen which fixture he would appear in it would surely have been the return to Selhurst Park, where he shone on loan last season. When the clubs met at Stamford Bridge in November Loftus-Cheek spent the entire afternoon on the bench, hearing one set of fans – in the away end – sing his name. “To hear them sing my name was a warming feeling,” he said. “It was good to see some familiar faces. It would have been nice to come on, but hopefully I will get to play against Palace next time.” He has started one of eight league games since, and though Sarri has said “there is no chance” of him leaving in January another afternoon of inactivity against a club managed by Roy Hodgson – who pledged that “there’s always a place for you here” – might at least make him consider his options. SBAlthough it is not long since Manchester City walloped Southampton 6-1, the champions would be unwise to assume that it will be a walk in the park when they visit St Mary’s on Sunday. Given that Southampton’s new manager has been nicknamed the Alpine Klopp, the champions cannot afford to show any complacency after faltering against Palace and Leicester. Ralph Hasenhüttl has already inconvenienced Arsenal with his energetic pressing style and the Austrian will relish the opportunity to pit his wits against Pep Guardiola’s possession game. City, who have endured a troubled festive period, will have to be ready to run hard as they attempt to close ground on Liverpool at the top of the table. JSIt was heartening to see Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain step up his recovery on Christmas Eve, the 25-year-old posting a photo of him punching the air in delight as he took to training on grass for the first time in eight months. The visit of Arsenal to Anfield this Saturday (and this week’s claim that the reason the Gunners didn’t often start him was because they had to pay Southampton £10,000 every time he played more than 20 minutes) brings the midfielder back into focus regarding what his absence means to both teams. Liverpool seem to be coping rather well without the England man, but how Arsenal could do with his confidence, energy and directness now in an inconsistent midfield. With Mesut Özil withdrawn at half-time in Brighton “for tactical reasons”, Granit Xhaka and Matteo Guendouzi inconsistent, Henrikh Mkhitaryan injury and Aaron Ramsey seemingly with one foot out of the door, it remains a mystery who Unai Emery will choose to combat the league leaders. One suspects a fully-fit Oxlade-Chamberlain is exactly the sort of player than Unai Emery would love to have in his ranks. MB• Liverpool v Arsenal, Saturday 5.30pm• Emery faces touchline ban after being hit with FA charge for kicking bottleThe bald facts facing the ision’s bottom two sides, Fulham and Huddersfield, are these: over the last 20 years a total of 12 teams have had fewer than 12 points after Boxing Day, and of those dozen, eight ended the season at the bottom of the league. Only two teams have recovered from such a dismal first half of the season to survive: West Bromwich Albion in 2004-05, whose miracle escape was completed only because of an 82nd-minute last-day equaliser for Charlton against Crystal Palace, and a decade later Leicester, the exception to all rules, who managed to finish 14th and were league champions a year later. It is, in other words, rare for teams to do as badly as Fulham and Huddersfield have in the first half of a season, and having done so it is extremely likely to prove fatal. Huddersfield, currently bottom, face the teams at the moment occupying 19th, 18th and 17th places in their next three league matches, something of a post-Christmas extended relegation 18-pointer if their current run of six consecutive defeats is still going in mid-January then, as in many households over Christmas, their goose will surely be cooked. SBBy the end of it, you get the feeling that Ed Woodward himself could have motivated Manchester United’s players better than José Mourinho. The relief around Old Trafford is palpable after José’s exit and Olé’s entrance has coincided with Alexis Sánchez’s return from Chile, where he was taking an extended break to deal with his injury. Sánchez was at Old Trafford to watch the Huddersfield win – it now seems a fire has been lit under the former Arsenal man, even to the extent that he was at Carrington on his days off on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Solskjær said Sánchez could be fit enough to feature against Bournemouth on Sunday but will at Newcastle on the 2 January. It’s up to United’s attackers this weekend to maintain their recent form and make sure it’s not their spot that Sánchez nabs in the north-east. MBOne of the most worrying features of Burnley’s alarming decline has been their loss of organisation at the back. Sean Dyche’s side have forgotten how to keep their opponents out at the moment – Everton did not have to work particularly hard to put five past them on Boxing Day – and their suffering is likely to continue if there is no improvement when West Ham visit Turf Moor on Sunday. Yet perhaps one way for Dyche to help his players regain their defensive discipline would be by shedding his loyalty to Joe Hart. Dropping the former England goalkeeper would be a bold call, but Hart has started all of Burnley’s league games this season and has been a prominent part of one of the ision’s leakiest rearguards. Given that Burnley have even become a soft touch at set-pieces, it could be time for Hart to make way for Tom Heaton, who deserves a chance to show that he is too good to be on the bench. JSIt is strange to think that Claude Puel was reportedly on the verge of losing his job a week ago. Leicester have bought their manager plenty of breathing space with stunning victories over Chelsea and City since then and they have a chance to tighten their grip on seventh place when they host Cardiff City on Saturday. Yet while they will be expected to beat a team yet to win on their travels this season, it will be interesting to see if Leicester are capable of passing a different kind of test against Neil Warnock’s strugglers. There will be no pressure on Cardiff to open up. They will know that Leicester can strain for inspiration when moderate opponents choose to sit deep and play on the break. Puel, whose critics have been silenced for now, might need creative players like James Maddison to step up to the plate. JSRafa Benítez’s team selection for the Boxing Day game at Anfield – Isaac Hayden, Yoshinori Muto and Joselu made their second, fifth and also fifth starts of the season, while a handful of first-team regulars were rested – left him something of a hostage to fortune for the trip to Watford, having (not unreasonably) identified this match as more winnable. But perhaps the key name missing from the team at Liverpool has only made seven starts himself in 11 matches this season without Fabian Schär on the pitch Newcastle have taken three points at the rate of 0.27 per game in eight games with the Swiss centre-back on the field they have snaffled 14 points at 1.75 per match. The run started against Watford in early November, when an injury to Jamaal Lascelles saw Schär – who had not made a first-team appearance in over two months – come off the bench at half-time, with Newcastle scraping their first win of the season. Watford meanwhile dominated, especially in the first half, at St James’ Park and only their woeful finishing saved Newcastle from defeat, so Javi Gracia’s side will feel they have a score to settle here. SBChris Hughton must be relieved to have his preferred centre-back pairing back of Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk available once again. Three defeats have passed since Duffy was sent off during the win over Crystal Palace, and although he returned for the draw against Arsenal on Boxing Day, Dunk’s own suspension saw him replaced by Leon Balogun, who directly contributed to Arsenal’s opening goal by giving the ball away – twice – on the edge of his own area. Saturday’s opponents at the Amex, Everton, have been inconsistent of late but have not struggled to score goals, with their last away day yielding five goals at Burnley. The form of Mat Ryan in goal and the emergence of Bernardo at left-back has been a big plus defensively for Hughton but without their first-choice 6ft4in giants Brighton look suspect defensively and will be eager to register their first clean sheet since October against Everton.

Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6a4933e43c81912552e7a4bc16d34bb3b699a9c/0_126_3845_2307/master/3845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d96d0b65d796bfb7f8baedd95483de80","title":"moment complete calm how guardian readers unwind","story":"We asked you when in the past decade you felt most relaxed. Here are your stories and picturesAfter a classic London renting situation, where my partner and I had to live with a leak just above the bed for a month, we finally got the savings together to get a shoebox of our own. No leaks yet, thankfully. It was on the first or second day, while we were eating on the floor over a sheet (with a bit of wine in tumblers), and were laughing and looking out of the window, surrounded by an endless pile of boxes and bags, that I felt a sense of calm I had never experienced before.Lying on my swing seat in my garden, the sun shining and a gentle breeze through the leaves of the birch tree above me. My swing seat was the best purchase I ever made: I’m on holiday whenever I sit on it. Whatever my mood, it answers to it, whether I’m happy or sad, elated or exhausted, with friends or on my own, for breakfast, dinner, lunch or tea. It is the best thing.In the middle of a small barn, in May 2012 at the end of 48 hours of lambing, while sitting on a low hay bale the only human in a barn full of sheep. I am no farmer, and in that barn I was no more than a nursery maid. Sheep mums being mums and lambs being lambs. The nursery had a rhythm: when the skipping and eating stopped, there was a calm that absorbed me. At that moment, life was good, and I was a part of it. I was one of the flock.Social media has some great benefits, but it can easily become mentally and emotionally burdensome. So, when we went to Havana in Cuba we made the decision to stay in a casa particular, essentially a private home, that had no access to the internet, a phone signal or any of the other trappings of modern life. For two days, in a small farming town called Viñales, we truly switched off. In the months since, I have deleted my Facebook account, closed email accounts and use my phone only for keeping in contact with close family and friends.In the minute after my second daughter’s head had crowned. The midwives were chatting, laughing and taking care of everything. It would soon be just me and my baby, in a secluded newborn ward, where I could just breathe and see the changing light through the window. No criticisms, no complaints, no office politics, no prioritising other people’s moods, no factoring in bills to pay, no existing for others. Only this most real thing that we were still doing together. This was the start of our conversation, the one that will continue all our lives.Sitting on Pentire Head, near Polzeath, north Cornwall, on a sunny October day in 2013. Tucked out of the wind, feeling the sun on my face and listening to the waves crashing against the cliffs below. The sea was almost turquoise and I felt a moment of complete calm all was well with the world.In July 2016, I tagged along for a day on my friend Ralph’s fishing boat, hauling lobster and crab pots for him around the Eastern Isles of the Isles of Scilly. The best bit was halfway through the day, when we were sitting there on the water in the sun, a mile out to sea, eating our cheese and pickle sandwiches, drinking a flask of tea, and lobbing the crusts and the odd bit of crab bait to curious fulmars that had joined us. Marvellous.An afternoon in hospital in Montélimar in 2009, after having had all four wisdom teeth removed. They had been growing horizontally and should have come out when I was a teen. One day, at 40 years old, with my first ever real toothache, I was told by a dentist that they had to come out straight away. I was waking up from the anaesthetic and staring out of the window at the intense blue sky, watching huge clouds of steam floating up from the nearby nuclear power station. I am self-employed with two children, and moments like that are incredibly rare. For once, I was without a care in the world.I had been having relationship difficulties for some years, and one day snuck away to visit my daughter at university. It was the first time in a long time that I felt free. I didn’t have to watch what I said or did, as I knew my daughter loved me unconditionally. Every minute was precious: we talked, laughed, ate out, shopped and hugged. That day was my first taste of what our life could be if I had the courage to leave, which eventually I did.My first ever wild swim as an adult was September 2012 in a tarn in North Yorkshire, hunting for a friend’s lost mobile phone. However, I didn’t embrace the joys of intentional outdoor swimming until October 2017, and I’ve been addicted ever since. The impact of the water meant I could think of nothing else but what was happening to my body: the numbing of the fingers, the sense of needing to gulp air but attempting to slow myself down to regulate my breathing. The sense of foreboding that I woke up with that morning has gradually faded, and has been replaced with a sense of wonder at immersing myself in the elements.September 2016, lying on a sunlounger at night on the terrace of a hotel on a hill outside Fiskardo, Cephalonia, with my husband, Richard. Every night, we would sit there and look at the beautiful sky, with no light pollution, and watch the shooting stars. We did this for an hour, chatting or sometimes just staying silent. Sadly, Richard died suddenly from a heart attack the following April. Perhaps understandably, I haven’t felt as relaxed since as I did on that holiday.It was a bright, clear day in September in a sleepy part of northern France, and I had stopped with my family at a lake. The water was gloriously cold, and I felt alive. Treading water, I turned to look at my family on the empty beach, waving and laughing at me, and I felt absolute contentment at being somewhere so beautiful with the people I love most in the world. The sunlight created an almost perfect reflection of the surrounding arc of trees and I realised that I was miraculously happy.Being off-grid with no phone, no people, no food, books or noise (other than the occasional breeze and a few flies) in Rub’ al-Khali – AKA the Empty Quarter – one of the most beautiful, harsh and huge deserts in the world. Every year, I get dropped off deep in the desert and stay alone for three days, with enough water and shade to survive, and without any expectations on me or my time. There is no experience like it that has this level of silence and peace.Walking the Camino de Santiago in September to mark the end of four years of study. Two girlfriends and I walked the Camino Inglés, and the freedom from anything else other than the walk each day was incredibly liberating. Every morning, we convened at 8am, had breakfast and set off, walking steadily to our destination, pausing occasionally to take in different sights and appreciate the landscape as it unfolded before us. The feeling of release from our cares was amazing, and we are already planning our next walk, along the Portuguese coastal path.I recently started an oil-painting course. The first week was landscapes, and I spent three chilly hours in a field painting the view. It was the most relaxed and carefree I had felt in a long, long time. My painting was pretty dreadful, but it didn’t matter: I had tried something new and felt proud of myself.In October, I went on a school trip to the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. After a long day of studying, my friends and I were free for the night and went swimming together. Maybe it was the lack of adult supervision, the scent of the sea or the general comfort I had from being with my friends that made me feel so relaxed. We were as free as a bunch of 16-year-olds on a school trip could be, which isn’t much, but at least I felt as if I could do what I wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97ec54e0f7d44bf62f023a0637444bcb13f4ce5a/0_84_4865_2919/master/4865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=416bd726fdfe3fc3ef290de6c85b1039","title":"best photographs 2018 and stories behind them","story":"From California wildfires and an erupting volcano to a close-up crocodile snap – photographers recall how they captured some of the defining images of the year. Selected by Sarah Gilbert10 December This was the day the supreme court in India repealed section 377 of the Indian penal code, which criminalised homosexuality. It was a momentous occasion. At the celebrations in Bangalore they were tossing activists in the air, bursting confetti and balloons. I didn’t see any hostility or fear. For me this photo depicts relief and immeasurable joy. The activist in the photo, Akkai Padnashali, said this was the happiest moment of her life. I think it speaks volumes of her belief that everyone is equal and deserves to be treated as such in the eyes of the law.22 October I took this picture at a dangerous time in the confrontation between Palestinians and the Israeli army in Gaza City. I certainly endangered my life – I was on the front lines. It was intense. The Israeli army were firing gas and bullets. But I think it was worth the risk. The protesters are fighting back against years of siege and it is startling to see their anger. They are still there, fighting back. For me, this man brandishing the Palestinian flag shows that they still have a sense of freedom.Morning in a cattle camp, South SudanStefanie GlinskiAFPDuring dry season in South Sudan, cattle herders seek lower ground for water and pasture. I took a flight, a helicopter and swam through a river to get to this cattle camp. The animals, cattle herders and families are waking. The herders are on the road and sleep between the animals. Photographs from South Sudan normally capture problems or civil war. This was more positive. The peoples’ relationship with the animals is close. They drink cow’s milk and wash their hands and hair with cow urine. They use cow dung to keep mosquitoes and flies off, burning it to ashes with which they cover their skin. It was incredibly dusty when I got there as overnight fires had just been extinguished. That’s what makes the beautiful colour.Mugshot of Bean, the lost dog, New JerseyCape May Police DeptAP17 July Somebody reported that this dog, Bean, was running loose. We took the mugshot to add a bit of levity and fun to our job – in most cases it’s not appropriate. Eventually someone saw the photo on social media and sent a message to the owners, so they got Bean back. He’s a really famous dog now. We’ve seen news articles from Japan and Germany about him and we had a million views on the Facebook page. We have a national night out against crime when the community gets together and Bean’s owners sent us 150 Bean photos for the kids, which they loved. We didn’t expect the response we got at all. The perception of law enforcement tends to be negative, so any chance we get to show people we are just normal people really helps.Woman in the aftermath of an earthquake, IndonesiaJorge SilvaReuters7 October Central Sulawesi was one of the most affected areas during the tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia. Everything was totally upside-down. It looked like the earth was melting. The liquefaction was turning soil to water, so it appeared like the earth was alive, running. The mosque is destroyed and toppling over in the background. This family was searching for their home in the rubble. They didn’t even recognise it – it had moved 150m away from where it normally stood. She’s holding a stuffed rabbit and you wonder: who owned that rabbit? That woman had lost her three children. I asked her to stop and I took the portrait in one frame. Then she turned around and kept walking.15 October I took this on the day Turkish investigators entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to search the building, following the death of Jamal Khashoggi. The only entrance for cars was in front of the main entrance – so the media would part to let them through, then congregate again. The security guard is trying to hold us all back. I got the photo by standing with one foot on a tree stump and the other on a steel barricade so I could see over the crowd. You only have 10 seconds to take that kind of photo, but looking back I was like, wow. It pretty much sums up the story: Khashoggi was a journalist and his death was linked to press freedom. Saudi is a closed country and here there was a security guard blocking the press from taking photos.16 May I was covering the Kilauea volcano eruptions and I’d heard that this golf course had a good viewpoint. I was trying to photograph when someone yelled: “Get out of my way, we’re tryna play here!” It was incredibly incongruous – and surprising to me, how unfazed the golfers were. To people living in Hawaii, these events are a part of life. People are accustomed to the power of nature around them. Often we go ahead with our daily activities amid these incredible things happening alongside us.Stuck in the mud at the Dakar rallyFranck FifeGetty Images13 January I’ve been photographing the Dakar rally since 2013. It’s more than a job, it’s a passion. I cover most of it by helicopter, strapped into my seat with the door open and my feet dangling in mid-air. We were flying over the Bolivian plateau when we saw this very muddy spot with little lakes on either side. Cars were struggling to get through, and we realised it would be even harder for the motorbikes. So we landed nearby and set up. It was completely crazy. While some avoided the mudhole, others were stuck there for 40-45 minutes. Franco Caimi, pictured here, was one of the luckier ones. He almost went over his handlebars, but then fell back into his saddle. We decided we ought to warn them, but some still carried straight on in. Interview by Phil DaoustUS border agents detain a Honduran mother and childJohn MooreGetty Images13 June Trump had recently implemented the policy of child separation when this photo was taken. The families were in darkness after a harrowing journey. They had no idea the policy had changed and they might be separated. They just knew they were escaping something dangerous and moving into an unknown future. Immigration is often discussed in terms of statistics, but the little crying girl is the reality of the zero tolerance policy. Her mother’s documents were being inspected, and when she was asked to set her child down, the little girl burst into tears. Later I discovered they weren’t separated. That was a relief, but others were. You can only imagine the terror.The gunwomen of PennsylvaniaSpencer PlattGetty ImagesThe running of the bulls, Pamplona, SpainPablo Blázquez DomínguezGetty Images7 July The running of the bulls at the San Fermin festival is an integral part of culture in Pamplona. It lasts for nine days and even people who don’t like the bulls go, for the music, dance, food and drink. The picture is taken from the balcony of Carmen, a woman who lives on that street. I knew it was a good spot because Pedro Armestre captured the festival from the same balcony in 2013 and it was a really nice photo. It’s one of the best views of San Fermin you can really see the vibrancy and the atmosphere.Mass start of the Ironman BarcelonaCharlie CrowhurstGetty Images for Ironman20 May I’ve been to the Ironman Barcelona race before and I knew I could get a sunrise-esque photo if the conditions were right. I went down to the beach and tested it. Walk two metres in and you’re already waist-deep in the water. It’s a real steep drop. On the day, I wore trunks, stood in the water with my camera and waited for the start. No one else was in the water. I was so close to them – maybe five metres away. Suddenly they were sprinting into the sea at full-pace, with spray going everywhere. It’s an inidual sport, so this is the only moment you can capture the high energy of everyone together. At the start I was thinking “Just start now!” because the conditions were perfect. With every second the purples and the oranges that give it that hue were fading. Everything came together perfectly.Road destroyed by earthquake in AlaskaMarc LesterAP30 November We are pretty used to eruptions in Alaska, but this was different. We wanted to visibly tell the story of the structural damage that is hard to see. The quake had caused traffic to grind to an absolute halt, so it was impossible to photograph this spot on foot. I knew I’d have to fly. The viewpoint from the plane captured the enormity of the damage. The subtle cracks and splinter patterns in the ice and the lakes around it – it’s so unusual to see it from that perspective. It’s surreal. The earth looked like it was prepared to swallow the surface. The earthquake was ranked as potentially deadly. It’s amazing there were no deaths.California wildfire: ‘Oh my gosh bro, this is crazy’Stuart PalleyZuma Presseyevine9 November I’ve photographed over 100 wildfires, but the California wildfire was one of the most intense. This was a few days in and it was wholesale destruction. For 12 miles there was a line of people evacuating amid a backdrop of this huge, ominous, orange-grey fire. People were crying and screaming, watching their homes burn down, running for their lives. All hell was breaking loose. And then, almost like a movie, this guy rolled past on his skateboard saying: “Oh my gosh bro, this is crazy,” with his phone in his hand filming. That would only happen in Los Angeles. The photo really puts the fire in the context of the location.Sea of plastic waste, Panggang island, IndonesiaLaurent WeylPanos Pictures20 July Panggang is a small island in north Jakarta where there’s not enough land for the inhabitants. They are making space by throwing the plastic waste they have accumulated into the sea. Society has changed a lot there. Food used to be wrapped in leaves it was natural, biodegradable. Now everything’s wrapped in plastic, but there’s not much education about plastic disposal – there are health problems because the community are burning soft plastics and breathing in the air. They just don’t realise it’s a problem. The girl looks so happy because it’s normal for her. I ed in the sea near this island and it was awful. It’s full of litter: furniture, bags, whatever, they just throw it in. This photo shows the worst-case scenario of overusing plastics. That level of consumption is crazy. You could walk on the plastic there.Horses and riders in South DakotaStephanie KeithReuters3 August I covered the Standing Rock pipeline protests and met Ivan Lookinghorse, a tribal leader on the Cheyenne River Indian reservation. A year later he invited me to this 400-mile horse ride from South Dakota to Fort Laramie, which marked the 150th anniversary of the Sioux nation’s treaty rights. I became part of their community on that ride. Without our relationship, I wouldn’t have got the photo – I was part of the action, riding around in the tall grass, doing fun thing like kids do. I wanted to show them having a fun life. That group of kids are so special. The treaty gave them some bare-minimum rights over sustenance, but it’s a bitter pill. The Sioux people used to have so much land and now their community is in crisis. They are living on reservations in the poorest counties in the US.Snapping the crocodile: ‘People ask how I didn’t get eaten’Sean ChinnCaters News26 September I lived on a boat in the mangroves in Cuba for a week before taking this shot. Between some ing we went to an area where they’re familiar with crocodiles. Guides called out “Nino” – and a minute later this crocodile came up to the boat. I was waist deep in the water. I shot this with a dome port, which gives the half-in, half-out, composition. I wanted to show the two worlds together – that we can coexist alongside apex predators. Films portray crocodiles as man-eating monsters, but they’re not. I was scared before taking this photo because I hadn’t been in the water with a crocodile before I mainly photograph sharks. People ask how I didn’t get eaten, but the crocodile was relaxing with its mouth wide open. I was lighting it with two strobe lights and it wasn’t bothered – they’re quite chilled creatures.Hondurans march towards the USGuillermo AriasGetty Images27 October This image of the migrant caravan travelling to the US border was used by Trump as propaganda, to label them as criminals and invaders. But you can see here that they’re just trying to walk. They are in unity, marching over that bridge, next to this beautiful landscape. The danger for photojournalists is that no matter how hard we try to be accurate, others might use our work to push their agenda. People decided to leave Central America in huge numbers because they have no basic safety there. In some ways they were naive, hoping they’d get to the US and Trump would say: “Come in! Let’s come together and we’ll give you visas,” once he saw their pain. On these first steps they were very hopeful, but when they got to the border they realised it was going to be pretty dark for them going forward.12 December I was covering this neo-Nazi rally in Georgia and had heard they were going to have a secret ritual after dark. We all met at this bar, and were told they were planning to set up a big swastika on a cross and burn it. There was a moment when the organiser turned on me because he thought I was there for a leftwing organisation. As the torch was burning and the men were chanting, I got a little nervous – almost high on the adrenalin. It’s a frightening photo because most people, myself included, don’t realise these secret rituals still happen until they see it. I am not Caucasian so I was surprised at how nice the organiser was to me. He thanked me for coming. I don’t know why they let us photograph.7 February This was taken during the release ceremony for child soldiers who had been fighting in South Sudan’s war-torn region of Yambio. The boy was the youngest there. He was nine. He is standing in a line with the other soldiers who are also children, but much older and taller. It’s a powerful image because he’s so young, and what happened to him is so unjust. He’s been around these big guys for way too long, doing things he didn’t want to do. You can see how his innocence has been taken away from him. He was really shy and quiet. We talked about games he liked to play and it struck me that he’s just a little boy who really wants to be home with his siblings and his family.Car submerged in floods, Bucksport, South CarolinaSean RayfordGetty Images26 September I was covering hurricane Florence and it had hit landfall. There was a cemetery on the street and coffins were floating around. I’d never seen that before, and I’ve covered a lot of floods. Then I saw this quaint little old car, submerged in the water. It’s incongruous: this modern invention that still can’t reckon with nature. The photo sums up how powerless humans are to stop mother nature once it gets going. People know these floods are coming each day it creeps up and yet for the most part no one can do anything about it.Daniel Ricciardo celebrates F1 victory in MonacoDan MullanGetty Images27 May This was my first grand prix in Monaco. Red Bull had built this massive station for the media with a swimming pool on top. Daniel Ricciardo had just won his first Monaco grand prix. Everyone was flooding the station, knowing that’s where he would go: he had to fight his way through the crowd to get in. The media were all around the pool, like a natural amphitheatre and then he jumped in. I was opposite Ricciardo on the other side of the pool. It was as much about positioning as the technical skill. If I played it wrong, I could have been on the edge, soaking wet, holding a camera above everyone’s heads, trying to get a good shot and failing miserably.* This article was amended on 27 December 2018.

Also in the audience are three experts – singer Cheryl, Strictly professional dancer Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison – who will coach the final nine acts and give them feedback. At points, their frustrations become evident when they see talented performers overlooked by the public.Morrison said: “It’s hard to sit there as someone who has studied dance, but it comes down to the general population’s take on dance. It can be a great thing and it can also be a bad thing because they don’t understand the hours and the commitment and the sacrifice it takes to be a great dancer. But perhaps there was something in them that didn’t connect.”Hall, who used to be executive producer for Stars in Their Eyes, said: “I thought combining a kind of doors opening with the splitting of a mirror down the middle and turning it into a reveal would be something new and unique to dance.”He said Cowell, who has not worked for the BBC before, had been “key” to the creation of the show, funding the pilot, helping fine-tune the format with co-producer Thames, and “he even told Cheryl she would be mad to turn this down”.The Greatest Dancer will be presented by Alesha Dixon and Diversity dancer Jordan Banjo and features a erse lineup of contestants. Strictly is still hugely popular, but is now 15 years old , so the BBC is keen to find more new Saturday night shows.The BBC’s director of content, Charlotte Moore, described Greatest Dancer as “epic, warm and very much a people’s show. We are very excited about it.”When asked how being a mentor on The Greatest Dancer compared with being a judge on X Factor, Cheryl said it was different: “It did feel more competitive with X Factor, because at the end someone was winning a massive record contract. With this show … you’re not trying to create a career. Hopefully a platform, but not a career.”Thames’s managing director, Amelia Brown, said all kinds of dance acts were welcome, from ballet to street, and “the result is … a dance show with a little bit of magic”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/019e7d5c18a465a2315a0e1e8e4a6eda050834bd/0_90_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c533683130963fddc50ac844655d02c6","title":"thames water meter check was a waste of my time","story":"It is not possible to install meters in my terrace of houses, yet Thames insists on checking each one separatelyWe live in a terrace of 30 houses which has a canal to the front and back. In the past neighbours have tried to get a water meter installed but have been told that the position of the houses precludes it. Lately, though, Thames Water has told us we must have a meter or else face an annual bill of £601.92 per year. Our bill is £288 for two working adults. Each property is then visited by an inspector who comes round to tell the owner that it’s not possible to install the meter. Despite my efforts they will not inspect the whole street at once and they won’t come at a time when I am at home from work so that they can tell me the same thing. Meanwhile I am having final reminders that they will double my bill. It is becoming a farce, the cost of all these inspections will of course be passed on to the consumer. This sounds like a big-business one-size-fits all policy that makes no allowances for circumstances.Thames Water says there is a process for mass exemption of properties without inidual inspections, but that tends to apply to blocks of flats with a shared hot water supply.Houses in your terrace could, it says, have adapted pipework which would permit a meter which is why each one must be visited.You have now had your inspection and, surprise surprise, it showed that your home cannot support a meter. You will therefore be moved on to the assessed household charge, rather than the penalty premium rate levied on those who won’t cooperate.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Liberty caps, one of the most prevalent species containing the psychoactive ingredient psilocybin, produce their mushrooms at below 15C in the day and 10C at night – often next to manure – with the first freezing temperatures heralding the end of the season.Magic mushroom use was popularised during the 70s when it emerged as a legal alternative to LSD, but they were banned in 2005. However, more than 200,000 people in the UK used them in 2017-18, an increase of a third on the previous year. According to the 2017 Global Drug Survey, they are the safest “recreational” drug.Recent studies have suggested magic mushrooms have therapeutic benefits and can help treat depression. Despite this, it is a class A drug and picking psychedelic mushrooms is an offence punishable with up to seven years’ imprisonment. Nonetheless, it is not an offence to have them growing on your land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf4d362f7ebf460f17f4b8821af87598cd4dbdc1/0_0_5413_3248/master/5413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c06932fc469c0dd3cfb0705f1563e3b","title":"vaping is 95 safer than smoking claims public health england","story":"As scepticism rises, PHE says e-cigarettes could help more people quit smokingThe government is launching a new campaign to try to convince the UK’s smokers that vaping is safe and a good way to quit, in a bid to counter the scepticism generated by some scientific studies and media headlines.“It would be tragic if thousands of smokers who could quit with the help of an e-cigarette are being put off due to false fears about safety,” said Prof John Newton, director of health improvement at PHE.“We need to reassure smokers that switching to an e-cigarette would be much less harmful than smoking. This demonstration highlights the devastating harms caused by every cigarette and helps people see that vaping is likely to pose only a fraction of the risk.”PHE says the risks from vaping are tiny compared to smoking. Some studies that have been published focus on the risks without looking at those of cigarettes. A lab study from Birmingham University in August, for instance, claimed that vaping could harm cells in the lungs. While the authors said they did not believe e-cigarettes were more harmful than ordinary cigarettes, they suggested that over 20 or 30 years there might be an effect and urged “cautious scepticism” about the safety of vaping.Dockrell said all the scientists in the field had ambitions to improve health. “We like to think of our scientists as being detached about these things, but in fact the scientists involved in this area on both sides are deeply passionate about it,” he said.Studies about the risks of chemicals in e-cigarettes run prominently in the media. Some were misleading and others were contradictory, said Dockrell. “People don’t know who to believe and they believe the thing that suits them best,” he said. A smoker who finds it hard to quit may not want to believe that e-cigarettes are safe to try.One of the stories that does the rounds is that vaping causes “popcorn lung” – a condition that makes people cough and struggle for breath which can be caused by a chemical used to flavour popcorn that is also found in e-cigarettes. But the chemical, diacetyl, is also found in ordinary cigarettes at levels 100 times higher.Concern about e-cigarettes is high in the United States, where vaping has taken off among school students. Many use a small device called Juul, the size of a USB stick. Anti-tobacco campaigners are alarmed that e-cigarettes will be a “gateway” to smoking, and some studies suggest this could happen.PHE says that although e-cigarette use did rise among young people in England up to 2015, the numbers have flattened off since. Unlike the US, the UK has tight regulations, it says, and a limit on the nicotine level in e-cigarettes – which is higher in Juul in the US than it is in the UK. “There are no studies that show vaping increases tobacco use among young people in the UK,” said Dockrell.“We want to encourage more smokers to try and quit completely with the help of an e-cigarette, or by using other nicotine replacement such as patches or gum, as this will significantly improve their chances of success. If you’re trying to stop smoking, our free online personal quit plan will help you find the support that’s right for you,” said Newton.Dr Lion Shahab, from University College London, who appears in the video, said: “The false belief that vaping is as harmful as smoking could be preventing thousands of smokers from switching to e-cigarettes to help them quit. “I hope this illustrative experiment helps people see the huge damage caused by smoking that could be avoided by switching to an e-cigarette. Research we and others have conducted shows that vaping is much less harmful than smoking and that using e-cigarettes on a long-term basis is relatively safe, similar to using licensed nicotine products, like nicotine patches or gum. Using e-cigarettes or nicotine replacement such as patches or gum will boost your chances of quitting successfully.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93825eedc63d4a1ed34434d784991cf2c9a8d9be/0_192_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45b6af386783a24c2392f42e7dd429ff","title":"kareem abdul jabbar kaepernick nichols serena","story":"Colin Kaepernick, Maggie Nichols and Serena Williams left us better off because of their commitment to sport and societyToday’s athletes have to carry a lot more baggage than a smelly gym bag and the giddy dreams of their parents. If they hope to achieve true greatness (or GOAT-ness) – and not just fleeting athletic notoriety – they also have to shoulder the leg-wobbling weight of responsibility to the community. This responsibility can come in different forms: charity work, as a role model andor political activism. At the same time as they’re pushing the boundaries of their sport, they have to help define and promote the values of their community, even if that goes against some of the members of that community. That kind of athlete needs as much courage off the court as they do on it. Maybe more. With that in mind, in no particular order, here are my picks for athlete of the year, based on conduct most becoming a professional athlete.University of Oklahoma gymnast Maggie Nichols will be honored in January with the 2018 NCAA Inspiration Award. This year she won an NCAA inidual national championship as well as becoming the first gymnast with two perfect 10s on every event. She is the only gymnast to post back-to-back “Gym Slams” with a 10.0 on every event in consecutive seasons. What makes her achievements even more remarkable is that she accomplished this while undergoing the kind of personal stress that would have sidelined most of us. Right before the start of the 2018 season, Nichols revealed that she was the first of what would become hundreds of young girls to accuse Larry Nassar, the team doctor for USA Gymnastics, of sexual molestation.Beyond exposing the exploitation of the athletes, her courage in coming forth also led to uncovering the negligence of the USA Gymnastics organization in stopping the abuse. The subsequent lawsuits have resulted in USA Gymnastics declaring bankruptcy and a complete reorganization. “Coming forward made me a stronger person,” Nichols said. “Going through such a traumatic event and growing the courage to come forward took a lot of strength for me. It was very hard. But after I did so, I felt that I was inspiring others which gave me so much strength and made me feel like an inspiration which is so motivating.” Because of her and the other gymnasts who have come forward, thousands of other young girls are safer to focus on the joys of the sport instead of worrying about predators.No one disputes Serena Williams’ place as one of the most successful athletes in the world. She has dominated tennis for most of her career, tying Steffi Graf’s record of being ranked number one by the Women’s Tennis Association for 186 consecutive weeks. Her achievements have not only encouraged young girls to take up tennis, but her prominence as a black woman in a mostly white sport has inspired more African-American girls to pursue the sport. That would be enough to make her one of the most influential athletes this year. But she has gone even further in redefining the sport by redefining the way females are perceived, not just as athletes, but as women.For most of her career, she has faced body shaming for being a muscular woman. Watching her stride onto the court confident in her powerful body is a stark refutation of the harmful traditional view of beauty which praises skinny, physically weak women in need of a man’s strength. Fortunately, that grotesque and self-loathing image is being replaced by women like Williams who aren’t ashamed of their muscles.Williams is also the embodiment of what NFL coach Vince Lombardi used to say: “It’s not whether you get knocked down, it’s whether you get up.” She returned to professional tennis just months after giving birth, a procedure that nearly killed her due to a pulmonary embolism that required multiple surgeries. Despite the trauma to her body, she is back playing as hard as ever, demonstrating that motherhood is not an impediment to ambition, but a bonus in providing a new perspective. “I think having a baby might help,” Williams said. “When I’m too anxious I lose matches, and I feel like a lot of that anxiety disappeared when Olympia was born. Knowing I’ve got this beautiful baby to go home to makes me feel like I don’t have to play another match. I don’t need the money or the titles or the prestige. I want them, but I don’t need them. That’s a different feeling for me.” That difference was demonstrated when she returned to play tennis, only to find that the WTA had changed her world ranking from number 1 to 451, a clear punishment, whether intended or not, for her taking time off to have a baby. After public outcry, the WTA this week changed their rules regarding women returning from giving birth. Williams continues to improve the sport through her athleticism and her social stances.Coach John Wooden taught me that sports wasn’t just about making us better athletes, but about making us better people. Compassion, kindness, and morality were more important than a championship season. Fame wasn’t an accomplishment, it was an opportunity to show our gratitude to the community that we are a part of by changing it for the better. That’s what these three exceptional athletes have done this year: left us better off because of their commitment to a sport and to society."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a03feb182f5811403e613b188d4a9c4b7c972c0/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8f17f8235d9847e58e8ebb6c9afe1a3","title":"women stars 2019 rugby tennis cricket football athletics","story":"Georgia Stanway (Manchester City and England)Dynamic and prolific, Stanway, 19, is blessed with such an unerringly powerful right-foot shot that Manchester City fans have likened it to “a traction engine”. The Barrow-born woman grew up as a Newcastle United fan, idolising Alan Shearer, and there are definite shades of Shearer about aspects of her game – particularly the type of goals she relishes scoring. Having represented England at every junior level and scored on her senior debut against Austria during the autumn, Phil Neville will surely find it difficult to leave Stanway out of his squad for the summer’s World Cup finals and has already made it clear he wants her on the plane to France. Her record of averaging virtually a goal a game for Manchester City in the Women’s Super League, moreover, has offered Nick Cushing’s side hope of pipping Arsenal to the title. If Stanway can still sometimes look a little raw at times, her passing is not only surprisingly accurate but reflects an ability to operate in an attacking midfield role. A keen analyst of the game, she is already planning to take her coaching badges. Do not be surprised if she wows all comers at France 2019. Louise TaylorOthers to keep an eye on in 2019: Mallory Pugh (Washington Spirit \u0026amp USA), Selma Bacha (Lyon \u0026amp France), Patri Guijarro (Barcelona \u0026amp Spain), Lea Schüller (Essen \u0026amp Germany), Marie-Antoinette Katoto (PSG \u0026amp France).The biggest contest of the women’s cricket calendar is coming in 2019 – the multi-format Ashes. It is the arena where all Anglo-Australian cricketers make or break their reputations and for the 20-year-old Molineux, it is a tailor-made opportunity to take centre-stage. The left-arm spinner made her debut for Australia in March 2018 but really grabbed attention later in the year when she finished as leading wicket-taker in their T20 series against Pakistan in October. She was expected to be one of the outstanding names of the World T20 but struggled to make much of an impact, taking only four wickets.Nonetheless she appears to have done enough to dislodge Jess Jonassen and claim a regular place in the Australia XI, meaning the likelihood is that she will feature in all three formats during the Ashes – including that rare opportunity, a Test. It’s a huge challenge so early in her career but given the prodigious skill and control with the ball she has shown so far, it is one she looks set to rise to. Raf NicholsonOthers to keep an eye on in 2019: Sophia Dunkley (England), Jemimah Rodrigues (India), Georgia Wareham (Australia), Jess Watkin (New Zealand), Radha Yadav (India).Hannah Botterman (Saracens and England)Only 19 years old and with only five caps to her name, Botterman is establishing quite the reputation as a prop of international repute. She made her Saracens debut just last season, helping them to claim the inaugural Premier 15s title by scoring the winning try in the final against Harlequins – the form that saw her called up for England’s series against Canada, during which she made her senior international debut. Her progress has been such that she appeared in all three of England’s autumn victories – against the USA, Canada and Ireland – and is a mainstay of the Saracens squad who are well-placed to defend their title. Rugby runs in the family for Botterman, whose uncle Gregg made nearly 200 appearances for Saracens between 1988 and 2000, and whose aunt, Jane Everett, was also a prop and represented England. With Simon Middleton’s side looking to recapture the Six Nations title from France next year, Botterman’s rapid progress is only likely to continue. Gerard MeagherOthers to keep an eye on in 2019: Ian Jason (France), Beibhinn Parsons (Ireland), Lagi Tuima (England), Sarah Goss (New Zealand), Fiona Lecat (France).A few days after her 17th birthday Sydney McLaughlin became the youngest US track and field athlete to compete in an Olympics for 44 years, reaching the semi-finals of the women’s 400m hurdles. In May, though, the buzz about the American’s generational talent became a deafening cacophony when she ran 52.75sec for the 400m hurdles. Not only was it the fastest time ever by a junior – and the 10th fastest in history – but it would have won her gold in the Rio Olympics by nearly half a second. And she did it at just 18 years of age.No wonder McLaughlin, who has over 300,000 followers on Instagram, recently signed a deal with New Balance which is rumoured to have made her one of the best paid athletes in the sport. She has also been snapped up by the Beverley Hills talent agency William Morris Endeavor, which represents Serena Williams, Denzel Washington and Emma Stone. It sees her as a crossover talent who will infiltrate the mainstream. Only the brave – or the foolhardy – would bet against that. Sean IngleOthers to keep an eye on in 2019: Alina Shukh (heptathlete, Ukraine), Briana Williams (sprinter, Jamaica), Salwa Eid Naser (400m, Bahrain), Yin Hang (50km walk, China), Imani-Lara Lansiquot (100m, GB).Naomi Osaka had the sort of season dreams are made of – despite the minor nightmare at the end, when, in her first grand slam final after rising through the WTA rankings in 2018 from No 68 to No 5, she won the US Open against a backdrop of a Serena Williams meltdown. “I witnessed some stuff, that’s for sure,” she later said of her season. Still, it was unfortunate that the finest player in the history of the women’s game inadvertently spoiled her breakthrough moment. But, composed beyond her then 20 years, Osaka handled it with decorum and good humour. Hugging her mother in the stands, it hardly seemed she had endured one of the game’s most dramatic episodes. Like Alexander Zverev in the men’s game, Osaka is very quotable. Asked what she was thinking as she served for the US Open title, she said she recalled an earlier moment in the second set, “When she broke me in that one game and I had to try and save break points, I was like: ‘What would Serena … do – oh, she’s right there. Oh wait, what am I doing?’” She’s doing rather well, as it happens.

While not quite the innovation most were likely seeking, notches allowed manufacturers to remove everything from the front that wasn’t screen.Now that the smartphone is essentially all screen on the front and a slab of glass on the back, what’s next for phone innovation?Notches are an ugly necessity at the moment – everyone but Apple agrees – as the camera has to go somewhere. But they don’t have to be large intrusive bars.2019 will see new hole-punch screens, which literally have small holes in the display through which the selfie camera pokes. Huawei has already announced two phones with a diminutive hole in the display, as has Samsung with its Galaxy A8s.With more devices expected to follow, it appears 2019 will be the year of the punch-hole display.What was long seen as the holy grail of biometric systems, the fingerprint scanner embedded into the screen finally became a reality in the mass market at the end of 2018 with the OnePlus 6T and Huawei Mate 20 Pro.Strictly speaking, the scanners are under the display, reading the ridges on your thumb or finger through the pixels of your screen. The current generation optical sensors are to be joined by improved ultrasonic sensors next year in a variety of phones.When all you have is a screen on the front and camera on the back, there’s not much to differentiate one model from the next in terms of design.“The rectangular touchscreen has become the dominant design for smartphones and there is little sign of that changing anytime soon,” says Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight.If you were hoping for a radical new design in 2019, you might be out of luck.Having killed off the compact camera, smartphones are coming for the big, expensive digital SLRs and their ilk.“Cameras are a major battleground when it comes to competitive differentiation,” says Wood.Expect to see even greater use of computational photography, where multiple images from single or multiple cameras are combined to create a photo with algorithms, improving your candid snaps, particularly in low light.5G will finally launch in 2019 with faster data and ever more expensive phones. But it won’t just be 5G phones pushing up the price. The cost of phones in the top-end market dominated by Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy S series is expected to continue to rise.“Don’t be surprised to see the £2,000 phone in 2019 – the advent of 5G, premium materials, perhaps foldable devices and more will see the emergence of a new ultra-premium segment,” says Wood. “Apple has let the way on smartphone inflation and we expect manufacturers to keep pushing the boundaries – particularly as people hold on to their phones for longer.”If you can’t stomach paying £1,000 for a phone, there is hope. With a new super-premium category, the market for slightly more competitive devices that offer top-performance is likely to expand.OnePlus has proved the niche exists with top-end phones costing under £500 in UK. Now it has been joined by Chinese rival Xiaomi and it aggressively priced top end phones, alongside the increasing sales of Honor, Huawei’s cheaper sub-brand.Giant leaps in performance and capability are long gone, chilling the desire to upgrade and leading to an ever increasing segment of the population holding onto their phones for longer.Like the chicken and the egg, it’s likely the more expensive a phone is the longer someone might hold onto it, which may in turn force prices up as manufacturers struggle to maintain profits. At least those without a cut of services such as Google Pay or the Apple App Store.Like something out of science fiction, folding phones will become a reality next year, with one already unveiled and Samsung’s effort due to be launched at some point in 2019.Whether or not the reality lives up to the fantasy, folding phones are likely to remain niche for years.“Although a magnet for gadget lovers, the folding phone’s inevitable high cost and its trade-offs in usability will result in limited shipments. Problems are likely to include poor readability in sunlight, a bulky design to protect the screen’s fold and the need for an external screen,” says Wood in his predictions for CCS Insight.Still, if you really must have the most bleeding-edge device, it looks like you will be able to buy one in some form as the never-ending quest for larger and larger displays continues.

Itaewon has also become a centre for dance music venues: Cakeshop, one of the city’s flagships clubs, expanded last year to a second space, Contra, a lounge bar next door.

Footage of the scene showed the sky flickering a bright blue-green for several minutes.The strange sight was caused by an explosion at the Con Edison power plant in Queens, with the New York Police Department officially confirming on Twitter that the cause of the remarkable sight was the explosion and there was “no evidence of extraterrestrial activity”.“There was a brief electrical fire at our substation in Astoria which involved some electrical transformers and caused a transmission dip in the area. We’re currently investigating the cause of the incident,” Con Edison tweeted.Police advised people to avoid the area and later confirmed no one had been injured as a result of the incident.The New York fire department confirmed they had received multiple reports of explosions in the Long Island City and Astoria area, to which they had responded. At 10:15pm they reported the incident was under control and there were no reported injuries and no fire.Residents left their homes as the black sky turned neon blue, with several telling the  they thought they were witnessing an alien invasion.Lucas Espinoza, a Queens resident, said: “I was eating dinner in my living room and out of nowhere the lights and TV started flickering and then the whole sky – which was pitch black a moment earlier – lit up with a pulsating greenish blue light. I ran up to my rooftop and grabbed the video while it lasted for a few minutes.”George Delis, who lives down the road from the plant, told the : “A little while ago, the TV went out and I see this massive bright light. It was so bright I thought it was a UFO. I was so excited I grabbed my phone and saw right down the block at Con Edison, a transformer was on fire. It was so bright, much brighter than the sun ... I’ve been living here for 37 years and I’ve never seen this happen before.”The incident cause several streets to lose power and also caused a blackout at LaGuardia Airport.The mayor of New York Bill de Blasio confirmed the extraordinary light was “caused by electrical surge at substation”, but said there were no current fire and no injuries. He said the MTA had power, but there were delays on the 7 train and that power was “coming back on” at LaGuardia, but travellers should expect delays.The airport urged people to check their flight status with their carrier, saying “Many flights are departing, some are not”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eeffe04e5b8d4ddc62d16038eefe556dd4ef9098/536_640_5520_3311/master/5520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9948475ab1932f401acd38416ecdd2e","title":"scooters california oakland los angeles bird lime","story":"Environmentalists raise concern as Lime and Bird vehicles pile up in California lakeIt was a sight as common at Oakland’s Lake Merritt as the ducks paddling on the water or the seagulls fighting over scraps: a bright green motorized Lime scooter was submerged just feet off the murky shore.“Aw man, the Lime person just came by this morning,” James Robinson, executive director of the Lake Merritt Institute, said when he found out about the latest scooter deposit.It was just one of nearly 100 Lime and Bird scooters that have been dumped in the lake since late September, Robinson said. In October alone, he said, his volunteers counted 60.This year may go down in the history books as the year of the scooter: the year all different brands and colors began appearing along sidewalks around the world, seemingly out of nowhere.To those who hate them, they’re like an invasion from a dystopian robot future. To their fans, they’re the future of urban transport: green, high tech and fun.What is undeniable is that the rollout could hardly be described as smooth, with vigilantes, decrying what they describe as typical tech industry hubris of companies profiting off of public spaces, expressing their displeasure through vandalism.Some have defaced the vehicles with profane stickers and feces. Others have tossed them into trash cans and trees.And then, of course, there’s the dumping in waterways. A website tracking scooters tossed in the Willamette river counted 17 in August alone. San Francisco Baykeeper, an environmental watchdog group, has recorded at least two scooters that have ended up in the San Francisco Bay since May. The organization has since taken up the cause against the dumping in Lake Merritt, near its offices.“We’ve just been so frustrated,” said the Baykeeper executive director, Sejal Choksi-Chugh. “They’re just not taking this seriously.”Meanwhile, few scooter companies will say for sure how many scooters have been vandalized, stolen, or damaged in the past year – or even how many scooters they’ve launched worldwide. Scoot Networks told the Wall Street Journal that more than 200 of the 650 scooters in San Francisco had been stolen or irreparably destroyed within two weeks of their launch, but Lime did not respond to questions on this particular topic. A Skip spokesperson says the company does not disclose numbers when it comes to theft but that Skip has seen an overall decrease.Bird issued a statement: “Vandalism of all types of property is a problem that should not be tolerated by communities or local law enforcement.”“We do not support the vandalism or destruction of any property and are disappointed when it takes place,” a Bird spokesperson said. “Nor do we support the encouragement, celebration or normalization of this behavior. Bird encourages people in communities to report incidents of vandalism to Birds, and irresponsible behavior on Birds, to local authorities and to the company. We investigate all reports directed to Bird and take appropriate measures, including removing people from the Bird platform.”But through social media, the documentation of the destruction has been vast. A number of accounts exist on Instagram dedicated to posting videos and photos of all sorts of scooter vandalism.Bird Graveyard, an account run by three friends in west Los Angeles, has more than 66,000 followers and receives anywhere from 50 to 100 submissions of scooter vandalism a day via direct message, from all around the world.The first post, on 23 June, shows a pile of Bird scooters, one visibly broken. From there, the posts steadily escalate with videos of people throwing scooters off of buildings, scooters on fire, scooters that had been run over by a car, and dogs defecating on scooters.The three men who run the account have never disclosed their names because of the nature of the material, but one who spoke to the said they were shining a light on a problem.“At the beginning, it was just a joke, to bring attention to it,” he said. “But we obviously feel a very certain way about it.”He said while he could appreciate the premise behind the scooters – an eco-friendly urban transportation alternative – he was put off by how the companies went about introducing the idea. In a way, the dockless nature of these scooters that these companies celebrate – the freedom to pick up and leave them wherever – can give the impression that the companies don’t care, whether it be about their product or the cities where it appears.“They just started popping up one day and nobody really asked for it,” the person behind Bird Graveyard said. “We weren’t really told it was going to happen. And this has happened everywhere.”The account was suspended once, he said, and it has had posts taken down – one video from Nashville of a car running a red light to run over a scooter was removed because Instagram told Bird Graveyard that it promoted violence. But the team say they are not worried about legal repercussions because they are not committing the vandalism: “We identify with the anger and how it’s being expressed, but we’re in our 30s almost,” he said. “If I was 18, hell yeah. I’d be out there scratching scooters because I wouldn’t know any better.”Their hope, they say, is that the vandalism will push a conversation and force the companies to consider their behavior when it comes to rolling out these scooters in different cities.Some companies have already done just that, especially following enforcement in some of the flagship cities. San Francisco, one of the first battlegrounds for the scooter war of 2018, impounded 503 scooters in the first incursion in the spring – 208 from Lime, 193 from Bird, and 102 from Spin, said Rachel Gordon, a spokeswoman for the city’s department of public works.The city returned the scooters to their respective companies after they paid their fees, Gordon said – Lime paid $15,784.50, Bird $15,547.17, and Spin $14,189.06.San Francisco has since launched a pilot scooter program, granting permits to Scoot and Skip in October. In the first six months, each company will be allowed a maximum of 625 scooters, with the potential to increase in the following six months to a cap of 2,500.“Skip’s strategy is to work closely with cities to be the best regulatory brand and leverage our co-founders’ experience to build the best scooters in the market,” said the company’s chief marketing officer, Julie Supan. “We only enter cities with local support.”While companies will work with local law enforcement when it comes to property damage and vandalism of their scooters, few work with community groups in seeking measures to curb environmental damage.According to Robinson, the executive director of the Lake Merritt Institute, only Lime is actively working with his organization, sending a representative to weekly cleanups to better understand the lake and how to retrieve the scooters. Robinson and his volunteers have been instructed by both Lime and Bird not to touch the scooters, which is frustrating, because company representatives don’t always end up locating the scooters in a timely manner.Lime has agreed to make the area around the lake a no-parking zone for its scooters, but at least two were still parked along the perimeter one recent day – and dozens more were located feet away.Robinson said he believed the solution was for the scooters to get some sort of locking and docking mechanism, like the Ford rental bicycles in the region. When the bicycle program first launched, he said, a few ended up in the lake, but the dumping stopped once permanent docking stations were put in place.“We have to, at some point, put the environment above profits,” Robinson said. “The community cares about the lake and it’s disheartening for them to come out week after week and see these products out in the lake and not harbor some kind of bad feelings toward these companies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2ae115a4fb230d85a449da60e539b399215f449/0_75_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f822f3f15a5948310f15d3b5d1e67644","title":"bangladesh election sheikh hasina heads for tainted victory","story":"Prime minister presides over burgeoning economy but is accused of holding onto power partly by jailing, disappearing or silencing oppositionBangladeshis will vote on Sunday on whether to grant a record third consecutive term to a prime minister who has overseen one of the fastest growing economies in the world, but whose government is accused of rampant human rights abuses.Sheikh Hasina, 71, is favoured to remain PM after a bloody election campaign that opposition activists have described as the most stifled in the 47 years since her father became the country’s first leader.Scores of opposition figures including Hasina’s major rival, Khaled Zia, have been jailed or disappeared in the months leading to the election. International election monitors and press freedom groups have complained of unnecessary delays in issuing visas.“Police harassment of opposition activists has reached unprecedented levels,” Kamal Hossain, a human rights lawyer who is serving as the candidate of the joint opposition, told the .Hossain, 82, said around 70 candidates from an alliance of opposition parties were too afraid to campaign in their constituencies after a spate of attacks on rallies and party offices by armed thugs.The opposition leader’s own car was attacked – allegedly by supporters of the ruling Awami League – as he was driving towards a national martyrs’ monument earlier this month.Two members of the Awami League were killed in the opening days of the campaign and dozens of supporters of both parties have been injured in scuffles and clashing rallies.Much of that growth has been fuelled by the country’s $20bn garment industry and the 4.5m jobs it sustains. The industry is credited with a doubling labour force participation among young women, which has flowed into maternal and child health benefits that have raised the country’s life expectancy to 72 years, higher than in neighbouring India and Pakistan.Despite the buoyant balance sheet, the capital, Dhaka, has been shut down twice this year by protests that some analysts say are evidence of a wider malaise, which could be registered at the ballot boxes if Sunday’s voting is unimpeded.“We have the fastest growth of ultra-rich in the world,” said Shahab Enam Khan, the research director at the Bangladesh Enterprise Institute. “But that doesn’t mean the lower strata has benefited.”Demonstrations in August were stoked by popular outrage at unsafe driving and a wider culture of impunity, which Khan said were “invisible” factors that may prove decisive. “Public security issues in terms of law and order, how the law is being enforced, whether people have confidence in the judiciary, will be determinate.”Earlier Bangladeshi governments have also been accused of trampling human rights, but watchdog groups say Hasina’s repression has been more extensive and effective. Hundreds of people have been forcibly disappeared or detained in secret prisons and nearly 450 people have been shot dead by police amid a crackdown on the narcotics trade this year, according to the human rights group Odhikar.Bangladesh’s authorities also severely restricted internet services across the country in an effort to fight “propaganda” ahead of the election. Internet services were slowed across the country with 3G and 4G services suspended for several hours on Thursday, a Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (BTRC) official said.“We asked telecom operators to halt 3G and 4G services temporarily on Thursday night. We have done it to prevent propaganda and misleading content spreading on the internet,” the official told AFP on condition of anonymity.He said higher speed internet services resumed on Friday morning after a 10-hour blackout, but could be suspended again later in the day.The authoritarianism has been accelerated by a uniquely weak period for the country’s second major political force, the conservative Bangladesh National party, which has traditionally traded power with the ostensibly secular and leftwing Awami League in the periods when Bangladesh has not been ruled by military government.The BNP boycotted the 2014 polls which it claimed would be rigged and so has no presence in parliament. Zia, its leader, was recently jailed for 12 years on corruption charges and her son, Tarique Rahman, was sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia in October for a plot to assassinate Hasina. Rahman lives in exile in London.Despite the BNP’s weakness, Hasina’s party has taken no chances, bringing an estimated 300,000 cases against the major opposition party in the run up to the election and ordering thousands of its members to be arrested.Facebook told Associated Press this week it had taken down 15 pages that it said were spreading pro-Hasina fake news in the run up to the poll.Facebook worked with a threat intelligence company that determined the people who created and managed the sites were “associated with the government”, said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy.Twitter later said it had suspended 15 accounts in Bangladesh, most with fewer than 50 followers, “for engaging in coordinated platform manipulation”.“Based on our initial analysis, it appears that some of these accounts may have ties to state-sponsored actors,” the company said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1779470ac020a5def763c86f7c3363d76b6f1568/97_172_901_540/master/901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a36d92a6393d829945c856c43c0621","title":"how monkey christ brought new life to a quiet spanish town","story":"Cecilia Giménez is proud of her amateur restoration, which has bolstered tourism to Borja and helped fund a care homeTangible and competitively priced proof of one of the Lord’s more mysterious recent manoeuvres can be found in a church nestled in the foothills of the Sierra de Moncayo in north-eastern Spain.A familiar face, now known to the world as Monkey Christ, greets visitors to the Santuario de Misericordia, its blurred and startled features staring down from bottles, thimbles, bookmarks, teddy bears, pens, mugs, T-shirts, mousepads, badges, fridge magnets and keyrings.For centuries, the nearby town of Borja was best known for its wines and splendid 16th-century town hall. All that changed six years ago when a simple act of devotion was transmogrified into an object of ridicule, a meme and, eventually, a tourist attraction.In the summer of 2012, a devout parishioner, Cecilia Giménez, noticed that an already flaking and faded painting on the church’s wall was under threat from a leak.Giménez, then 81, decided that if she did not act, the face of Christ that the artist Elías García Martínez had painted almost a century earlier would disappear for ever.Pained at the idea of its loss – and keen to conserve the interior of the church in which she had been married – Giménez began work, applying thick blocks of colour on which she planned to retrace the ine countenance.Had she been able to finish the job, things might have turned out differently. But Giménez had to leave town on a trip and her incomplete efforts soon came to the attention of the local historical association, which indignantly posted before-and-after pictures of the painting.From there, the story and images went viral.Before long, García Martínez’s work had ceased to be known as Ecce Homo and, as Monkey Christ or Potato Jesus, has become an irresistible visual shorthand for anything tending towards the disastrous.The townsfolk were up in arms, the media descended and Giménez lost 17kg through stress, worry and the thought that she had made a laughing stock out of Christ’s suffering face.Then two things happened: the anger in Borja subsided when people found out who had undertaken the restoration. And the tourists began arriving.“As soon as people knew that it was Cecilia who had done it, everything changed,” says the mayor, Eduardo Arilla. “And this has become a social phenomenon and a pop art icon.”Between August and December 2012, 45,824 people visited the sanctuary. The numbers may have dropped off since then, but Borja still receives 16,000 visitors a year – more than four times the number who came before Giménez picked up her brushes.Not only has the picture’s fame provided jobs for the sanctuary-museum’s two caretakers, it also helps fund places at Borja’s care home for the elderly, a haven for those who would not otherwise be able to afford to live there.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theArilla is careful not to condone the actions that put Borja on the map – and to point out that there is more to the town than just the Ecce Homo – but he welcomes the interest, the tourists and their euros.“It was a media phenomenon, but it’s also been a social phenomenon when it comes to helping people,” he says. “If it hadn’t happened, maybe Borja would have become famous for something else, like its wine. But we wouldn’t be as well known as we are now.”The media phenomenon has not been limited to Borja. In June this year, the overenthusiastic restoration of a 500-year-old statue of St George in a church in Estella, Navarre, elicited comparisons with Tintin, while the treatment meted out to a group of 15th-century wooden statues in Asturias left a professional restorer torn between tears and laughter.Estella’s mayor, Koldo Leoz, says the town has seen an increase in visitor numbers but adds that it predates the St George incident and is down to a concerted effort to restore the old Jewish quarter and attract pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago.Estella, he says, has no plans to capitalise on the botched restoration. “We don’t want to attract visitors because of the poor treatment of our heritage,” he says. “We haven’t publicised it and nor will we.”Ana Galán Pérez, the chair of Spain’s Professional Association of Restorers and Conservators (Acre), argues that such cases show that the country needs to do more to protect the myriad and often forgotten treasures of its past.“We seem to be rather indifferent when it comes to the heritage around us,” she says.“There’s still a long way to go and that’s why we need to educate society and public bodies so that they understand that every time someone without the right qualifications tries to restore a work, they run the risk of damaging or even destroying it.”Galán and others also dispute the notion that Spain is more prone to dodgy conservation than other countries.“When we talk to our colleagues from other European countries, they tell us that these things are happening but that they’re not picked up by the press.”Román Fernández-Baca Casares, director-general of fine arts at Spain’s culture ministry, describes the unfortunate restorations as “isolated cases” and says that almost all the country’s regional governments adhere to strict conservation rules.Giménez has come to terms with both her actions and the fame they have brought her and her town.As the mother of two disabled children, she is used to looking past the surface. When she looks at the Ecce Homo today, she sees “a handsome face a face that I love”.She also insists that she would do the same thing again. “It was done with good intentions and despite what happened, it’s been a good thing for Borja,” she says. “People from all over the world are visiting the sanctuary now. That’s the best medicine. I used to cry a lot over all this but I don’t cry any more because I can see how much I’m loved.”But Giménez is aware that things could have ended less happily.What advice does she have for other amateur restorers? “Don’t do it. It turned out well in the end here, but it doesn’t always end well in Spain - and you’ll find yourself in the papers.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Turnout in European parliament elections has been declining ever since the first votes in 1979.Could this time be different? The next European elections will take place in May 2019, less than two months after Brexit day, and never before have the elections been labelled so decisive by so many European leaders.During his successful run for the French presidency, Emmanuel Macron cast himself as the leader of the anti-populist, pro-EU forces. His opponents are eager to join the battle. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister and leader of the anti-EU League party, declared (paywall) that the elections would be “a referendum between the Europe of the elites, of banks, of finance, of immigration and precarious work” versus “the Europe of people and labour”.Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has said the vote will be a chance to say goodbye “not simply to liberal democracy … but to the 1968 elite”.In Brussels, three scenarios have been floated: a decisive surge for anti-EU parties, unexpected gains for pro-European parties and a third option of something confusing between the two. “A mess is the most likely outcome,” said one senior EU source defining this as a “grey” outcome of “progress by the populists, but still a strong majority of 400 pro-EU MEPs”.The centre-right European People’s party has been weakening, a result of poor performances in several countries (including France), but also splits over how to handle its Hungarian member, as the country goes backwards on democratic freedoms.Meanwhile the centre-left Socialists and Democrats party is expected to lose seats, as its member parties continue to fare poorly across much of Europe. The S\u0026ampD faction will also be hit hard by the loss of 20 Labour MEPs when the UK leaves the EU.The fall of the grand coalition will make the next European parliament more complex, with increased horse-trading and, possibly, as many as four parties needed to pass a law. Analysts writing for Carnegie Europe suggest it will resemble the Danish or Dutch parliaments, with more parties and more coalition options.European elections not only determine the makeup of the parliament, one of the EU’s two “co-legislators” along with the powerful EU council of ministers. The results also help determine the ision of the EU’s top jobs. In 2019, the presidencies of the European commission and European council will both be up for grabs.European elections – in reality a series of national elections – test the temperature of domestic politics. “Many use the European elections to show a yellow or a red card to the government,” says Janis Emmanouilidis, director of studies at the European Policy Centre. He thinks gains for anti-EU parties would “create pressures at the national level” meaning that the EU’s ided 27 governments are even less likely to agree on the fraught issues of eurozone reform or migration.Both the future of the euro and migration are likely to be centre-stage during the campaign. Some suggest that framing the elections as a stark choice between the EU and anti-EU is problematic. Not only does it paper over the big differences among “pro-EU” parties, it also risks fuelling myths about what the EU does.If the rules of the debate are set by anti-EU populists “who don’t really argue about what the EU is actually doing” but set up “straw man” arguments, that could rebound badly, said Grabbe. “It is quite dangerous because people will end up blaming the EU for all sorts of things it is not responsible for, rather than discussing its real powers and the things that really matter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b000a40a873790c40e4e09ffa437db3b57c3e1b2/0_6_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=231f0377bc453530ba86dd86b92fc2da","title":"loving it children walk from one end of new zealand to the other","story":"Jonathan Rapsey, six, and Elizabeth, nine, tackle trek with parents to become youngest to walk Te Araroa trailTwo children are on track to become the youngest to walk the national trail running the length of New Zealand, having completed the entire North Island a few days before Christmas.Jonathan, six, and Elizabeth, nine, have walked more than 1,200km (745 miles) since October when they set out with their parents, Chris and Jorinde Rapsey, from Cape Reinga at the tip of the North Island.The children are being home-schooled on the Te Araroa trail, which ends 3,000km away from Cape Reinga at the small seaside township of Bluff, at the bottom of the South Island.Jorinde Rapsey said her children’s daily energy and enthusiasm was impressive and both kids seemed “really happy” on the trail, with the greatest conflict so far which flavour muesli bar the family would eat each day. “At the start the children were tired and found some parts hard but now they are loving it,” Jorinde said. “It amazes me that at the end of a long day Jonathan still jumps around full of energy … overall they have just been really happy.”The family was averaging 20km of walking each day, Jorinde said, though occasionally they had clocked 30km. At time of writing the Rapseys were on the Queen Charlotte section of the trail at the northern tip of the South Island, after taking the ferry from Wellington to Picton on 21 December. The Rapseys are aiming to reach Bluff in March 2019.Jorinde said she and her husband rented out their Dunedin home to finance the trip, and they’d felt confident embarking on the adventure after two short family hikes in Fiordland in the lower South Island earlier in 2018.Both children are home-schooled in Dunedin and have been able to keep up with their studies on the walk. “We’ve been doing a lot of maths problems for fun to work out how much of the track is left, how far we’ve come, and how much further we’ve got to go each day. It’s amazing the questions we get,” Jorinde said.The Te Araroa trail s 3,000km along the spine of New Zealand and opened in 2011 after more than 30 years of planning. It passes through wilderness areas and alpine environments as well as cities, towns and major transport routes.The Te Araroa Trust chief executive, Mark Weatherall, said before the Rapley family, the youngest person to walk the trail had been an 11-year-old. “If these guys can do it then so many other Kiwis can do it too,” Weatherall said.This summer more than 1,000 people are walking the entire length of the trail and hundreds of thousands of people walk sections of it each year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/531ec54dfec1982da6a3941fad8ac46c35d88ceb/0_288_2190_1314/master/2190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ba681e886cf331af8392fb5902d6343","title":"newly declassified files show thatchers gloom over irish border","story":"Dublin’s National Archives receives document of heated 1988 exchange with taoiseach Margaret Thatcher admitted she was sending young boys “to their deaths” as she descended into despondency over what to do about the border in Ireland during one of the darkest periods of her premiership, newly-declassified files in Dublin reveal.During an “unusually tense” tête-à-tête with the then Irish taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, on the margins of a European council meeting in June 1988, Thatcher told him: “I do not know what to do about the border.”Northern Ireland was trembling on the precipice of full-scale civil war after a terrifying and inextricably linked cycle of violence starting with the SAS killing of three unarmed IRA members in Gibraltar.A loyalist grenade and gun attack on the IRA funerals at Milltown cemetery in Belfast claimed another three lives, and was followed days later by the killing of two British army corporals, dragged from their car, beaten and shot dead, after driving into the funeral procession of one of the Milltown victims.“Those two corporals were among the worst things in my life,” Thatcher told the taoiseach. “The savagery was unbelievable.”She said any move towards a united Ireland at the time would spark “the worst civil war in history”. “And it would spread to the mainland,” she added.During an hour and a quarter of heated exchanges in the British delegation rooms at a trade centre in Hanover, Germany, she said she did not want Irish people in Britain.“Your people come over to us. I wish they wouldn’t,” she said. “They come looking for housing and services. It’s the same in Northern Ireland. If there was a vote tomorrow they would vote to stay with us. They have better conditions in Northern Ireland and in England.”Several times she pleaded with Haughey – who vigorously defended himself against suggestions he was soft on violence – for more pre-emptive intelligence against the IRA and better training for the Irish police, the Garda Síochána.“If we don’t defeat the IRA, I don’t know what I’m going to do,” she said. “We can’t have the border open as it is now.“In recent times my feelings have run far higher than ever before in my life. I am not a natural hater, they are using the border to carry on an effective campaign.”Several times during the meeting, she came back to the border as central to her despair, saying the IRA were using it to move bombs over from the Republic or to flee from security forces in Northern Ireland.“I can’t seal the border,” she said. “There is no way we can patrol the 500 miles … Everywhere there is an open border.”Thatcher said the area contained the “biggest concentration of terrorists in the world” and “despite technological and other surveillance we lose them”.“And so yes,” she added, “I must send more young boys over to their deaths. I ask myself, am I entitled to do it? There is a borderline there but it is not an effective border.”During the extraordinary exchanges, just released into the National Archives in Dublin, Thatcher said she was “not winning the battle with the IRA” that sending in troops had been “useless” and she had “lost” unionists in Northern Ireland.“So I have failed …,” she said. “I have to deal with guns, bombs, beating people to death with sticks and many other barbaric acts.”She added: “I go berserk sometimes” when asked about the role of the police in Northern Ireland. Ultimately, she said, she had one objective: “That is to beat the IRA.”Haughey said he was “sorry you are so despondent about things”, to which she fired back: “I would not be despondent if I got pre-emptive intelligence.”The taoiseach insisted he held the “deepest personal conviction” against violence, which he blamed for “souring and disrupting and bedevilling” relations between Britain and Ireland.“And I see those responsible for it as being a greater danger to the Irish state than to you,” he added.Haughey told her she “must accept our total and complete commitment in this respect” and the British had to cease coming back with “counterproductive” suggestions which risked political backlash in Ireland.“Things happen now – horrible things – which perhaps could or could not have been prevented,” he said.“When they do, your people often blame us for lack of cooperation. I do not know if you are getting the best assessment of things on the ground.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f35fcd915c52e6dbf7207a32d4bae6ad8ae62016/0_29_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cdd0fbb888b3acb4e64e9fe0a2a3192","title":"political soundtrack drc uneasy mix of music and power elections congo","story":"As election looms on Sunday, meet the musicians accepting – and declining offers – to sing for candidates A hot, humid afternoon in Kinshasa. Traffic snarls and grinds on rutted streets. Heavy rain threatens. And Felix Wazekwa’s band load their bus with musical instruments in the suburb of Limete before heading to a tough neighbourhood far across the city. A local candidate in the elections rescheduled for Sunday has hired them to play at a rally.“If you can get people to dance then you can get a message across very easily. The politicians have a message, and I am the very good at getting people to dance. So they come to me,” said Wazekwa, who is one of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s biggest stars.The imminent election is two years late and has been forced on President Joseph Kabila, in power since 2001, by popular and international pressure. The stakes are high. The victor will command the DRC’s security establishment – and the lion’s shares of the revenues generated by the country’s vast mineral resources. The losers are likely to face years of repression.In the DRC, music and politics are inseparable. To gain an advantage, many politicians turn to the country’s singers and band leaders, hiring them for rallies, commissioning special compositions, or simply paying for a mention during a song.“During the campaign I sing what I’m told to sing … I’m not here to judge,” said Wazekwa, who recorded a recent single praising the government’s presidential candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, based on a text prepared by aides.With no revenue from royalties, systematic pirating, limited infrastructure and few public performances, many Congolese musicians have always relied on wealthy patrons.“The artists need money and politicians, especially those who have been in power for some time, want to burnish their image. This is a cheap way of getting publicity. You pay to be mentioned in one song, and it gets replayed many, many times,” said Israel Mutala, a Kinshasa-based analyst and columnist.The DRC is a creative powerhouse despite its deep poverty and endemic instability – and its eventful political history has one of Africa’s richest soundtracks.In 1960, the song Independence Cha Cha, celebrating the end of Belgian colonial rule, was a continent-wide hit. During his disastrous three-decade rule, President Mobutu Sese Seko commissioned “praise songs” from top artists.In recent years, a more contemporary and gritty style has emerged to challenge the famous “Rumba Lingala”, the DRC’s 70-year-old, Cuban-influenced, popular musical tradition.Not all see the tight ties between creative artists and politicians as healthy.“If there’s a relationship between music and politics, then it’s a very perverted one … When there are so many dead, raped, sick, miserable in this country then we musicians have a responsibility too … These are our fans, our brothers and sisters,” said Alex Dende Esakanu, AKA Lexxus Legal, one of the DRC’s most popular rappers.“Of course musicians have the right to take the politicians’ money, but I say it’s immoral.”Esakanu, 39, is now an opposition candidate and spokesman for the campaign of Martin Fayulu, a former businessman who was a marginal figure before the campaign but has been attracting large crowds.“The authorities are doing everything than can to block us. If the elections are fair, we have every chance of winning,” said Eskanu, speaking to the  at his home in a poor neighbourhood of central Kinshasa which, like most of the city, suffers from a chronic lack of electricity and drinking water.The DRC is in better shape than after the terrible civil war which ended in 2002, but 14 million of its 76 million inhabitants need emergency aid. In the east, dozens of militia battle for resources and at least 300 people have died in an outbreak of Ebola. The country is the size of western Europe but has no real road or rail network. Prices for basic necessities are soaring.“People have a very deep, strong desire to express themselves at the polls. They think that by voting they will have a better life. There is deep disillusion with the government and they want to punish those who have been in power,” said Mutala.Many blame Kabila, who took power at 29 after his father, Laurent, was assassinated in 2001, for the problems. But Kabila’s reluctant decision to step down, two years after his second electoral mandate expired, has defused some tension.Most observers believe Shadary will win, and many fear fraud to make sure the government’s choice is the victor. People have been shot at by police during rallies and protests.On Wednesday , the electoral commission announced it was cancelling voting in the cities of Beni and Butembo and their surrounding areas because of Ebola and militia violence. The areas are opposition stronghold, and local politicians denounced the move as an effort to swing the vote in Shadary’s favour.The two biggest opposition political figures have been barred from the contest on legal grounds so votes against the government will be split between Fayulu and Félix Tshisekedi, the only other candidate.“They’ve been very tactical, very clever. They’ve got the opposition exactly where they want them,” one diplomat in Kinshasa said of the government.Kabila told reporters this month he would not leave politics and planned to stand for election in 2023.Wazekwa defended his work for Shadary, who is under EU sanctions for his role in a crackdown on pro-democracy protestors last year.Other musicians pointed out that refusing a request from the government brings significant risks: tax investigations, cancelled licenses to perform and worse. A rapper who criticised the “vultures in velvet” in power was abducted by unknown men in the eastern city of Bukavu this month.Melo Costa Yekima, one of the leading figures in a new wave of younger musicians mixing dance with rap, said he had refused demands to record from both government and opposition.“You can’t separate music from politics ... I just try to ring an alarm bell and tell things as they are in our society,” said Yekima. “The elections are a good thing but I don’t think they will bring the changes that people want. But I am optimistic. I believe that things will sort themselves out here one day and Congo is going to be beautiful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04ccbb9b64a90ceecec9b7f063400a260cdc2621/0_97_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fb343fa21a75163325379b30501fc7a","title":"shared goals blyth spartans football team partners with visit north korea","story":"National League North club signs sponsorship deal with tourism company promoting trips to North KoreaA firm that organises tours to North Korea has signed a sponsorship deal with Blyth Spartans, in one of English football’s more unlikely commercial tie-ups.Non-league Blyth, who play in the National League North – English football’s sixth tier – announced that Visit North Korea had bought a pitch-side advertising board that was unveiled this week at the club’s home ground Croft Park.The announcement appeared in Blyth’s match-day programme before the club’s home draw with Spennymoor Town on Boxing Day. Links to Visit North Korea will also appear on Blyth’s website and social media accounts.Officials at Blyth, located near Newcastle upon Tyne in Northumberland, were “very friendly, professional and enthusiastic” about the deal, according to Tom Fowdy, who founded Visit North Korea in 2015.“Their commercial manager told me the chairman was open minded, so it was something they were more than willing to participate in,” Fowdy, a Sunderland fan, told the . “Football sponsorship was something I felt inspired to do, and I was confident that as a well-known, local grassroots club, Blyth was the best place to start.”The Visit North Korea website noted that spectators had quickly spotted the board and “were bewildered by what they saw”.The deal drew a mixed reaction on social media, with some questioning the wisdom of encouraging travel to a country that has been widely criticised for its human rights abuses.The Non League Nomads Twitter account asked if it was “the oddest advert seen at a football ground”.But Blyth’s commercial manager, Mark Scott, said the agreement did not amount to an endorsement of the North Korean regime.The sponsorship deal is not the north-east’s first connection with North Korean football.In 1966 the North Koreans carried off one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history by beating Italy 1-0 at Middlesbrough’s Ayresome Park, before being knocked out by Portugal in the quarterfinals.Fowdy, who is based in China, admitted the board’s appearance had caused “shock and surprise” among Blyth supporters, but added: “I’ve come into contact with a few Blyth fans who welcome the deal and are interested in Visit North Korea. Above all it’s bringing coverage, attention and recognition to their town and team.”The firm’s focus, he said, was on “education, travel, cultural exchange and positive engagement” with North Korea. “Rather than pursue confrontation and hostility, we encourage people to broaden their horizons and think differently.”UK citizens are free to travel to North Korea, where Britain has an embassy, but Americans were banned from visiting the country following the death last year of Otto Warmbier. The college student died soon after being released from 17 months’ captivity in the North.Washington is considering easing its travel restrictions to North Korea to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the impoverished country."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3742442.1545949956!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish boarding schools see surge in enrolment from brexit bounce","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClongowes Wood College: The second most expensive boarding school in Ireland at  €19,890 a year.Irish boarding schools are benefiting from a “Brexit bounce” as increasing numbers of overseas families choose to educate their teenage children in Ireland rather than the UK.Fee-paying schools say more Spanish and German families, in particular, are choosing boarding options for their children in recent times.Following Brexit, Irish boarding schools will be one of the few options within the European Union for overseas families who want to educate their teenage children through English.Enrolment in private schools in general, meanwhile, is on the rise as parents’ incomes return to boom-time levels, new figures indicate.Most fee-paying schools in the south Dublin area are now over-subscribed and say they have long waiting lists for day pupils.An  survey shows the most expensive boarding school this year remains St Columba’s in Whitechurch, Dublin, which charges up to €22,800.The next most expensive boarding schools are at Clongowes in Co Kildare (€19,890), Glenstal Abbey, Co Limerick (€19,300) and Rathdown School, Co Dublin (€19,275).For day pupils, Nord Anglia International School Dublin – which opened last September – is the country’s most expensive school, charging fees of up to €24,000 a year.It is aimed at the children of mobile executives and teaches children the International Baccalaureate rather than the State curriculum.St Columba’s is the next most expensive school for day pupils (€8,000), followed by Sutton Park in Dublin 13 (€7,900), Alexandra College, Dublin 6 (€7,386), St Gerard’s, Bray (€7,339) and Sandford Park (€7,150).Many of these schools report that they now have long waiting lists for prospective pupils.“There’s a massive shortage of day places in private schools in south Dublin,” says St Columba’s principal, Mark Boobbyer.“You can ring any south Dublin day school and they’ve got waiting lists and they’re inundated.”Among boarding schools, there is increased interest in so-called day-boarder options, where pupils can avail of meals and supervised study before returning home.Schools such as Glenstal Abbey in Co Limerick and Cistercian College in Roscrea, Co Tipperary, in particular, have seen increased enrolment since offering these options.Most fee-charging schools, meanwhile, have increased their fees this year by 1-10 per cent. Typical day pupil fees now range from €3,500-€7,000.Fees for Irish private schools are highly competitive compared with the UK, where charges are typically several times higher.This is due partly to the fact that the salaries of most teachers in Irish private schools are paid for out of the public purse at a cost estimated to be about €90 million.These State subsidies were reduced during austerity-era cost-cutting which saw fee-paying schools given a worse pupil-teacher ratio (23:1) compared with schools in the free scheme (19:1).This was on the basis that private schools could use their own resources to hire additional subject teachers or ancillary staff.A report commissioned by the then minister for education Ruairí Quinn into the income of private schools, published in 2013, estimated that they had more than €80 million extra a year to invest in additional support and facilities for their pupils thanks to the income from fees.While there have been calls from some Opposition parties for State funding of teachers’ salaries in private schools to cease, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education estimated this would end up costing the taxpayer at least €23 million.This would be as a result of some private schools opting to enter the free scheme and becoming entitled to State capitation grants and better pupil-teacher ratios."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3742507.1545947137!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mass extinction of species is happening in ireland ngo says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA number of species are ‘critically endangered’ and face a real risk of disappearing entirely without urgent action, including the curlew. Photograph: Mark L Stanley via Getty ImagesMass extinction of species is happening on Ireland’s doorstep. “It is not something which is happening somewhere else,” according to the Irish Wildlife Trust. A third of all species groups examined in Ireland, including plants, birds, butterflies, freshwater fish, dragonflies and sharks are either threatened with extinction or “near threatened”, it said.Although the climate crisis and its causes were relatively well known, the related “extinction crisis” was receiving less attention, the trust stated in a submission to the Government’s Climate Action Committee. In addition to global warming, loss of species is being driven by habitat loss, pollution and unsustainable use of resources, it warned.“Ninety per cent of our highest-value habitats protected under the EU’s Habitats Directive are in ‘poor’ or ‘inadequate’ status,” it said.Only 0.6 per cent of once-unique raised bog habitats in the midlands remain intact. In addition, Ireland has the second-lowest forest cover in Europe only about 1 per cent of our land area consists of native woodland.Chronic overfishing “has decimated the populations of once-abundant fish species such as cod, whiting, sole and herring”, and a third of native bee species face extinction, it said.Some 50 per cent of Irish rivers and lakes “are polluted, while obstructions such as dams contribute to once common species like Atlantic salmon appearing on the endangered species list.A number of species are “critically endangered”, and face a real risk of disappearing entirely without urgent action, including the curlew, the angel shark, the freshwater pearl mussel and the European eel. “Restoring nature is likely to be the easiest, cheapest and most effective form of climate action available,” the trust said.It called for an independent nature conservation agency to implement existing conservation commitments and underlined the need to “re-wet and re-wild” midlands bogs. Coillte, it said, must manage existing conifer plantations but restore them to native woodlands.The revised Common Agricultural Policy should adequately reward farmers for farming in a nature-friendly way so that Irish agriculture can be “carbon negative”, it added. “Weakened ecosystems cope poorly with climate change – as was experienced through 2018 as farming communities struggled with weather extremes,” it said. “Small-scale coastal fishing communities have all but disappeared. Conversely, restoring natural systems brings great opportunity in bringing benefits back to local people and resilience to those who depend upon them.”The trust hoped the Climate Action Committee could see the opportunity that restoring nature would provide in determining on how best Ireland should respond to climate change. “We firmly believe that this is a decisive moment in our relationship with the natural world and that we are likely to be the last generation to have the power to take meaningful measures to save life on Earth. This can be done to the great benefit of Irish communities,” Irish Wildlife Trust campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty stated in the submission.

Photograph: Jeff J MitchellReutersThe UVF held secret talks with the IRA Army Council in 1988 to discuss the prospect of a federal Ireland, state papers have claimed.According to the document, marked “Secret” which was released under the 30-year rule, the meetings were facilitated by Father John Murphy, a chaplain in the Maze Prison.The memo, written to the Taoiseach’s Office in November 1988, said that Fr Murphy was anxious to keep the meetings secret and listed the three main enemies of the talks as “the NIO (Northern Ireland Office), the RUC and the DUP”.“Fr Murphy was frankly surprised at the speed with which events had moved and was particularly surprised at the signs of apparent flexibility being shown by the UVF in this exercise where they demonstrated a willingness to at least talk about a wide range of possible future arrangements for Ireland, not excluding concepts like a federal Ireland,” Brendan Mahon, of the Anglo Irish Division wrote.Mr Mahon adds that Fr Murphy’s understanding of the concept of a federal Ireland was “based on the four provinces including a nine-county Ulster with a separate province-type arrangement for Dublin similar to the District of Columbia in the US”.Federalism is a process by which a central and regional government share power over the same geographical which indicates Dublin would have a say in a Stormont Government.The papers did not specify whether the UK would have a continued role in Northern Ireland.“John Murphy has now informed me on a highly-confidential basis that these talks have now moved outside of the confines of the prison and that the Army Council of the IRA and the leadership of UVF have now agreed to separate talks with the chaplains outside of the prison,” Mr Mahon wrote.The papers go on to state that neither the UDA nor the INLA were involved in the talks, which were indicated to have started in the summer of 1988.The UVF indicated to exclude the UDA due to a state of confusion within the organisation and “to their fears regarding the level of security force penetration of the UDA”.However, it was indicated that former Unionist leader James Molyneux knew about the talks and Fr Murphy “did not expect any trouble” from the UUP representative.Mr Mahon indicated he felt Mr Molyneux had given the “OK” regarding the initiative.Around the same time as the memo was written, November 1988, it was noted in the media that protests organised by unionists against the Anglo-Irish Agreement were less well supported than previous years.Fr Murphy also claimed that the flexibility being shown by the UVF was “indicative of the general uncertainty among loyalists as regards their future in a changed AngloIrish relationship”.The religious hierarchy were also kept in the dark, the memo reads that the bishops were not aware the talks had moved outside the prison, and that knowledge was confined to “the leadership of the IRA and UVF, two chaplains and now, ourselves”.The support of the bishops was apparently being held off, until their backing was needed “to forestall any attempt by other political interests to derail the initiatives”.Fr Murphy seemed to Mr Mahon “optimistic” about the prospects.“It is nonetheless an extremely interesting development entailing, as it does the military leadership of the IRA (as distinct from Adams etc) in talks with the most hardline loyalist paramilitary organisation.” -

Photograph: Tom Honan PA Wire The Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has defended so-called vulture funds, stating that they are more effective at writing down debts than banks which “extend and pretend” rather than reaching settlements with homeowners.Mr Varadkar also said that homeowners whose mortgages were sold off to such funds would be “no worse off” than those whose loans were owned by the banks.The Taoiseach said he disagreed with the use of the term “vulture fund” and criticised the practices of our own banks. “I’m always reluctant to use the term vulture funds because it is a political term. What we’re talking about here is investment banks, investment funds, finance houses, there are lots of different things and lots of different financial entities there and the term is used, vulture funds.“But you’ll know from the numbers that they’re often better at write-downs of loans than our own banks.“Our own banks tend to ‘extend and pretend’ rather than coming to settlements with people.“Increasingly they’re covered by the same regulations and the same consumer protections as the banks,” he said.Fine Gael is supporting legislation which is being brought forward by the Fianna Fáil finance spokesman, Michael McGrath, to regulate the funds for the first time.“So, what we’re working on is enacting legislation that Michael McGrath has brought forward, which is to make sure that so-called vulture funds are being regulated,” Mr Varadkar said.He said the Government was committing that people who made an effort to pay their bills even when the loan had been acquired by a “vulture fund” or credit servicing firm would have the same protections as other consumers.“We support that and we are going to make sure that anyone who has a mortgage, who is repaying their mortgage, making a reasonable effort to pay it, continues to have the exact same protections, the exact same consumer protections as they would if the loan was still owned by the banks.“That’s our commitment to make sure that people who pay their mortgages, pay their bills, are no worse off as a result and have the exact same protections,” he said.His comments come after controversy over Permanent TSB entering into an agreement with Pepper Finance Corporation last month that will see a portfolio of non-performing mortgages removed from the bank’s balance sheet. The agreement will see more than 6,000 loans moved to a special purpose vehicle which will be financed on the bond markets. The company has pledged to deal with the PTSB customers “sympathetically”.Mr Varadkar said that if PTSB had not sold the loans, the Government might have had to provide financial assistance.“We wanted those that were split mortgages to be categorised as performing but we just didn’t win that argument, so unfortunately they were counted as non-performing loans.“PTSB was required to get those loans off their books.“If they had not done that, the bank would have found itself in a difficult position and potentially we would have had to put more money into the bank, which is something we would never do again and we managed to avoid that.“But secondly, now that PTSB has been able to reduce the number of non-performing loans on its books, it’s now in a better position to do what it should be doing, which is to issue new mortgages, new loans to people.Despite Mr Varadkar’s reassurances, Opposition parties have previously expressed concerns in relation to the sale of loans to vulture funds. Sinn Féin’s finance spokesman, Pearse Doherty, has said the “major concern when banks are selling to the vulture funds is that there is no long-term interest. The big concern here relates to certainty. Regardless of people’s opinions of high street banks, they know that they want to be here in 30, 40 or 50 years.”The issue of home repossessions was brought to the fore earlier this month following the eviction of Anthony McGann and his two siblings from a house in Co Roscommon over a debt which had not been repaid to KBC Bank. Security personnel working for the bank were subsequently attacked at the property near Strokestown. Eight people were injured and six vehicles owned by security workers parked outside were burned out."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3742894.1545979494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new york skyline lit up blue after transformer explosion","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBuildings stand as the night sky is illuminated by blue light in New York. Photograph: Jeenah MoonBloombergA bright blue light lit up the New York skyline on Thursday night after a transformer exploded at an energy facility.The blast prompted a brief fire at a sprawling Con Edison facility in Queens — but no injuries — and a spectacular illumination that generated a flurry of online commentary.The explosion affected subway service in the area and caused a brief ground stop at LaGuardia Airport, which experienced power outages.Governor Andrew Cuomo described a “major electrical failure” at the electrical substation along the East River, near the Rikers Island prison complex and across a small bay from LaGuardia.Power had been largely restored to LaGuardia by 11pm and the airport was resuming normal operations.The lights caused a stir on social media as several witnesses posted photographs and videos of a bright, blue flash that filled the night’s sky.The Manhattan skyline and iconic East River bridges were suddenly silhouetted against a backdrop of pulsating light.People flocked to social media to find out what happened and to share their views of the plumes of smoke pouring from the transformer.“It was pitch black outside and then suddenly the whole side of the eastern sky was lighting up and changing colours,” said Madeleine Frank Reeves, who saw the lights from her Upper West Side apartment. “It lasted a couple of minutes.”Some observers wondered whether aliens were invading and joked that the trend of gender reveal parties had finally gone too far.Television host Keith Olbermann referred to the episode as the “Blue Light Special.”“Something insane is happening in the sky above Manhattan right now,” New York University sociologist Eric Klineberg wrote on Twitter under a video of the flashing sky.Mayor Bill de Blasio’s spokesman Eric Phillips tweeted that the lights were attributable to a “blown transformer.”John Tebbett, who lives two blocks away from the facility, told NY1 the explosion was followed for about five minutes by a loud roar.The blast had caused the lights in his home to flicker off and on, he said.– AP"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017.

Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Others were seized from holidaymakers who had purchased them in countries where their sale is legal.A Home Office spokeswoman said: Tackling the illegal smuggling of offensive weapons is a priority for Border Force.The figures were released as part of Border Force\u0026#39s annual transparency reportWe work closely with intelligence colleagues, as well as other law enforcement agencies, to ensure that frontline work is focused on the areas of highest risk and emerging trends are quickly identified.We also run regular intensification exercises at the border”.The figures come after a year that has seen the knife crime and stabbing deaths surging in the country and particularly in London.In November the number of murders in London surpassed the entire amount for the whole of 2017.Government guidance states that it is an offence to import certain weapons into the UK.Items subject to the restrictions include butterfly, zombie and stealth knives, samurai swords with curved blades over 50cm in length, knuckledusters and batons.Some organisations are allowed to import and hold restricted items for specified purposes, such as police forces importing batons and truncheons.Allowances are also made for theatrical performances, films and TV productions.As part of an attempt to crackdown on violent crime, the Government his introduced the Offensive Weapons Bill, which includes a proposed ban on delivering potentially dangerous bladed items to a buyer\u0027s home following warnings that age-verification checks can be sidestepped online.Please review our

He was holding a print-out of the draft of an article I’d written. “You did law, didn’t you,” he stated. It was true, my degree was in law. I nodded.\u0026nbsp“What’s this?” He asked, pointing to his desk. “It’s a desk,” I said. “Well f*****g well say so. Don’t say, ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs, and therefore might be a desk.’ It’s a desk.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI can’t tell you how often I’m reminded of Bambridge’s words. There is hardly a day that goes by when I don’t see a piece of writing or hear a speech that is pure verbiage, and can only have been produced by a lawyer or a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe latest example is particularly shocking. When I last looked, BT was supposed to be a communications company. Okay, telecommunications. But a corporation, nevertheless, that ought to pride itself on directness and speed of delivery. In that context, the ability of the receiver to comprehend should be paramount.\u0026nbspUnited Airlines mocked for corporate speak response to passenger rowSo, take this, from BT as it promises to overhaul its pay policies after the investor backlash following the £2.3m package handed to departing boss Gavin Patterson. The company will consider “a broader range of performance factors and wider circumstances” when determining executive remuneration. It also pointed to “a more structured process to help it step through the application of its discretion in the future.”Eh? Who writes this stuff? Clearly, not someone who believes in telling it how it is, and is unable to say something for definite without suffocating it in qualification. That has to be a lawyer, or as I say, a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe problem with this approach is that it suggests an organisation that is hidebound, stricken with fear, unable to proceed without a high degree of caution, incapable of saying “we screwed up, and we’re sorry”. Patterson received too much –\u0026nbspperhaps not under the strict terms of his contract –\u0026nbspbut, given the company’s poor showing, too much.\u0026nbspDecisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out.But BT cannot admit that, oh no. It won’t try to claw back the money as that would be unseemly, and besides, the lawyers have probably advised that would be difficult. Instead, it attempts to sooth and gloss over with words straight out of the lawyers’ lexicon of “safe” twaddle.\u0026nbspSlight as it is, in the overall picture of a multi-billion pound global empire, BT’s announcement about leaders’ pay is indicative of a loss of way, a lack of confidence. Intuition has succumbed to process.\u0026nbspWith any management there should be room for both, for the heart and the head. Of course, things have to be done properly and carefully, but they also need to be done. Decisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out. It is not the answer.Too often, I’ve seen the lawyers rule the roost. On a product safety issue, where fatalities had ensued, they were reluctant to let the management meet the relatives and express their condolences, because this could lead to an admission of liability. In another episode, involving a food company, they took the same line. Again, after a tragedy, a holiday operator was told on no account to contact the family.\u0026nbspWhile lawyers may give their advice for the best of intentions, to avoid the client being shredded in the law courts, and having to pay out vast sums, they do not afford enough attention to that other court, the one of public opinion –\u0026nbspand the one that these days, especially with instant relaying of news, 24-hour bulletins and social media, is increasingly vital.\u0026nbspThere’s little point in shoring up a legal defence, in cloaking a company’s actions in legal procedure and its outpourings in law-speak, if it simply makes the company the subject of derision, and harms its reputation.\u0026nbspSurely\u0026nbspit’s not beyond the wit of any intelligent C-suite member to say they share the loved ones’ pain, without stating there and then, it was the company’s fault? Likewise, is it really impossible for BT to say it recognises, and is concerned about investors’ frustrations, and will do its utmost to prevent a recurrence?Ask any business chief what keeps them awake at night, and they will say loss of reputation –\u0026nbspto the business, and to them, personally. It’s humans who determine how they and their organisation are judged, the basis for that\u0026nbsp reputation. Be human in everything they do, is the easiest way of achieving plaudits. That means being human in how they communicate, and in their actions.\u0026nbspPlease BT, in future, before you press “send”, stand back and read what you’re about to convey. Listen to the lawyers, but, remember, you’re human and you’re talking to humans.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That tweet raised concerns that the Trump administration is aware of something that markets are not privy to.President Donald Trump has been publicly supportive of Mr Mnuchin, but reports from CNN indicate that he may be frustrated with his Treasury Secretary. Mr Mnuchin supported the appointment of Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr Powell has implemented monetary policies that Mr Trump has criticised.“They’re raising rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think they will get it pretty soon. I really do,” Mr Trump said on Christmas of the Fed’s decisions to raise interest rates. Mr Trump was in Iraq during a surprise trip to visit American troops when markets closed on Wednesday, and had not tweeted the entire day.Analysts suggest that the administration’s comments about the economy may be driving some of the declines that have been seen recently.Callers to White House get automated message apologising for shutdownMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunWhat does the US government really mean and why is it happening?Children will still be able to track Santa\u0027s progress on Christmas Eve“The president’s angry talk about his displeasure with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is a great example of the old adage ‘loose lips sink ships,’” Tom Block, the Washington policy strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told MarketWatch. “Markets would not take well to the overt politicization of the Fed with the firing of the chair over displeasure with interest rate policy”.Others, meanwhile, have raised concerns that the declines represent real stresses on the markets.“The market’s volatility still seems to us to be more of a ‘run’ on the equity market based on fear rather than fundamentals,” said Dan Suzuki, portfolio manager at Richard Bernstein Advisors, told that website.Mr Suzuki noted that the ongoing government shutdown could be impacting stock market rates.“The difference between a run on the banking system and a run on the stock market is that the banking system has an explicit government backstop (FDIC),” he said. “In stark contrast, not only does the stock market not have a government backstop, but many of the drivers of the current volatility directly stem from government policy (trade, oil prices, the Federal Reserve, the government shutdown)”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style.

And I love him and that – I don’t blame him. But I was angry, and I got into trouble,” he says.“I had the Old Bill round my gaff every five minutes. I was a wrong ’un. No one knew how to help me. Then I found a father figure I didn’t even know I needed.“I went for an audition for a play and I met this old geezer who wrote it. He was an East Ender, he was a West Ham fan just like me. He thought I was alright and he gave me the part. Turns out it was a fella called Harold Pinter.“He became the most influential man in my life… He taught me that where I came from didn’t dictate where I went to.”He goes on to add: “Life can get a little stressful and we might get on each other’s nerves a bit, but remember how much there is to be proud of, to be grateful of, and get yourself a Harold, you know, if you can … Merry Christmas, my loves.”Danny Dyer’s Alternative Christmas Message airs on Christmas Day at 3.50pm on Channel 4Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He continued: “There is not a child born that, if it sees a snail for the first time crawling up a window pane, doesn’t think, what on earth is that? How does it stick on? What does it feed on? Look at the underside... What is it doing?”“Of course every child born is born with a curiosity for the natural world. If you lose that thing that you started off with, you’ve lost really one of the most precious treasures you have. Your life is the poorer.”“The paradox is, that we may be the most overcrowded people that have ever lived in history but in fact we get a wider view of the world than ever before.

The major update – which would have been perhaps the biggest change to Instagram ever – was so widely despised that numerous users suggested the app is now dead.But very shortly after, the change appeared to be reverted and the feed went back to normal. And now it appears all of that happened by accident.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Sorry about that, this was supposed to be a very small test but we went broader than we anticipated,” Instagram head Adam Mosseri wrote on Twitter, alongside an awkward-looking emoji. The change went to “a few orders of magnitude more people than intended”, he wrote.He said the change “should already be rolled back”. If it is still appearing, he told users they should “simply restart your app and you should be good to go”, Mr Mosseri advised.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost. You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts.

The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/02/17/instagram.jpg","title":"instagram update latest scrolling why reverse old version guide swipe","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  The message that pops up when the update arrives offers some clue about why this happened: Stories.Instagram update completely changes how users scroll through feedInstagram notes that the feature is more similar to the Stories tool that rolled out in 2016, allowing people to post disappearing photos and videos that could be clicked through in exactly the same way. It even tells people that they can use the same feed in just the same way.Since 2016, Stories has become probably the most quickly growing kind of media ever to be launched: not just on Instagram but everywhere on the web, the side-swiping, clicky way of getting through an app has spread itself across the entire internet. Instagram Stories is now twice as big as rival Snapchat, and makes up a major part of the way people use the app.Presumably excited by the vast popularity of those Stories, Instagram has decided to make everything else work that way, too.It is worth noting that even as Stories have gone from strength to strength, and Instagram has continued to grow, the company\u0027s founders also recently left the company. That was because of disputes with owners Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg about the direction of the company, according to a report in Bloomberg\u0026nbsp– and it may be that features such as these were the cause of those disagreements.It seems to be on its way to everybody, though that doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll definitely have got it yet. Force quitting the app and scrolling around a little appears to make the new feature most likely to arrive.Usually, new Instagram features – especially ones like this, which bring dramatic changes – are rolled out slowly, to a small group of people first and then gradually to everybody else. But this appears to have come in one fell swoop, on Thursday afternoon UK time.They hate it. Almost everybody seems to absolutely despise the update.Searching for the word Instagram on Twitter brings a whole host of posts, many including explicit language unfit for this website.Give me back my timeline, one illustrative but relatively family-friendly post reads.\u0026nbspThis update SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In short: no. Instagram isn\u0027t giving its users the ability to use the old format, even temporarily: once the update has arrived, it has arrived forever, by the looks of things.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

It will two years to send back all its data on the object officially known as 2014 MU69, but nicknamed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase meaning “’beyond the borders of the known world”.Alan Stern, the mission’s principal investigator said that on December 15, the team had decided there were no rings or moons in the path of New Horizons.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“I informed Nasa that we are “go” to fly by Ultima on the trajectory that yields the best science,” he wrote on the Nasa website.“As a result, New Horizons will approach to within 3,500 kilometres (about 2,200 miles) of Ultima early on New Year’s Day. There is no longer any chance we will ert to a farther flyby distance with consequently lower-resolution images.”He added: “What will Ultima reveal? No one knows. To me, that is what’s most exciting—this is pure exploration and fundamental science.”Nasa launched New Horizons in 2006.

As distant as it is, Pluto is barely in the Kuiper Belt, the so-called “twilight zone” stretching beyond Neptune.Other than how far away it is, little is known about Ultima Thule. Indeed, it was only in 2014, that Marc Buie, New Horizons co-investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, and others discovered Ultima using the Hubble Space Telescope in 2014.\u0026nbspIn 2016, researchers determined it had a red colour. In 2017, a Nasa campaign using ground-based telescopes traced out its size – just about 20 miles across – and irregular shape when it passed in front of a star, an event called a “stellar occultation”, the AP added.Mr Stern said the flyby – due to take place at at 12:33am EST on January 1 – will provide huge amount of information. “New Horizons will map Ultima, map its surface composition, determine how many moons it has and find out if it has rings or even an atmosphere,” he wrote.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Opal Tower at Sydney Olympic Park in Sydney, Australia.

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

The prospect of a no-deal in the near future will be weighing heavily on directors’ minds.“Uncertainty is already causing businesses to delay investment, hiring decisions and product launches, which also acts to weaken our international competitiveness further down the line.“The longer this state of affairs continues, the more we lose by it, even if these effects aren’t apparent in the here and now.”Another think tank, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), specifically suggested France will indeed overtake the UK to become the world’s sixth biggest economy next year.The finding appears to mirror the fear and concern highlighted in the IOD research among the business community, about operational systems that firms will be forced to change after Brexit.The CEBR said “disruption” to the British economy was inevitable due to lower inward and business investment, as firms hold fire from spending money until things have stabilised.But again there is hope, as the CEBR’s world economic league table report says Britain will return to the sixth spot by 2020.The think tank goes on to say\u0026nbspit believes the UK will retain its sixth position ahead of France through to 2033 at least.The data suggests that the underlying confidence in the economy could return if the shock of Brexit passes.Whether it is worth the risk of giving the economy an inevitable shock, and then betting on the return of confidence, will undoubtedly end up being a political rather than an economic question.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

I want us to have a vote as soon as possible, that’s what I’ve been saying for the past two weeks, and if that means recalling parliament to have the vote let’s have it.\u0026nbsp“But it looks to me the government has once again reneged on that and tried to put it back another week.\u0026nbspWe need to have that vote so\u0026nbspa decision of parliament can be made. What I suspect is that it’s a completely cynical manoeuvre to run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea.”Corbyn hails the Good Samaritan in Christmas messageThe House was last recalled during the EU referendum campaign in June 2016 to pay tributes to the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox. This was the 29th recall during a recess period since 1948.\u0026nbspOther issues MPs have been ordered back to Westminster over included a debate over the use of chemical weapons in Syria in 2013, and the riots in London and other English cities in 2011.In order for parliament to be recalled,\u0026nbspthe speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, must receive a formal request from the government which he would\u0026nbspthen consider and make a judgement on.As it stands, MPs will return on 7 January after a two week Christmas recess, but the prime minister has already summoned her cabinet a week earlier on 2 January to discuss no-deal preparations.Corbyn pledges to end law which criminalises rough sleepersMr Corbyn added that the government should not have gone into recess without a vote on the deal: “The prime minister and the Tory chief whip agreed the timetable motion, we agreed the timetable motion which was a five day debate, and it was put at that time at that week to ensure the select committees could have a chance over a week to comment on the agreement before it was put to parliament.“I agreed with...\u0026nbspI thought that was a sensible way of doing it. You would have the process in the EU, you had Theresa May agreeing it with the EU, you then had a short gap, about a week, in which everyone could analyse it and consider it and then come back to the House for a five day debate and then a vote.”He continued: “Three days into that they, the government, unilaterally pulled it and that shows the weakness of the system in the House of Commons where essentially the government holds the aces because they control the programme.“I said this to the parliamentary Labour Party and it\u0026nbspwas seen as a slightly odd thing to say – I said, actually, for a party that wants to go into government, I want to see the House of Commons stronger than it is, not weaker than it is, because\u0026nbspgovernments should be held to account by the parliament.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Picture taken with permission from the Twitter feed of Hannah Louise of the scene in Launcelot Close, Andover, where the body of a man has been found after an explosion caused a building to collapse this morning.Team Dash and Splash swimmers, some in fancy dress, getting into the Irish Sea at Bangor beach in Northern IrelandMembers of the Shakti Sings choir sing as druids, pagans and revellers gather in the centre of Stonehenge, hoping to see the sun rise, as they take part in a winter solstice ceremony at the ancient neolithic monument near Amesbury.

Asked to pinpoint the most difficult moment of 2018, Mr Corbyn said it was “bringing the party together over attitudes towards Brexit and the European Union”.\u0026nbspHe said the unanimity achieved at party conference was designed to bring both leavers and remainers together on two things: “The direction of social and economic policy by the Labour Party, and the other is of course the relationship with the European Union.”Now Mr Corbyn is facing demands from anti-Brexit activists within the party to convene an emergency conference to reevaluate the party’s strategy in the coming weeks – ahead of any vote – but the Labour leader said he did not “at this stage see the need for a special conference”.“A special conference would take some time to organise anyway,” he added. “I think we do have the agreement of conference on the overall position, and we do have a very large and representative national executive. But obviously if the national executive wanted to hold a special conference they would say so, but I have not had any indications of that from members.”In the interview, Mr Corbyn also claimed he was “totally” ready for any snap election, saying the party had already selected candidates in all of its marginal seats.\u0026nbspOne path towards a general election would be through tabling a motion of no confidence in the government. If it passed and a new government attracting the support of a majority of the House cannot be formed within 14 days, parliament is dissolved and a vote triggered.Pressed on whether Labour intends to make such a move in the coming weeks, Mr Corbyn said: “We’ve made clear it’s a question of when not if we do a vote of no confidence in the government, and obviously we do at a time when their confidence is the lowest ever, which I suspect will be after they’ve lost the vote.”\u0026nbspHe would not be “tied to a date”, but said if Ms May loses the vote “we will obviously make our views clear in the House”.“I’m not certain what the result would be,” he added. “We would obviously put a case of no confidence with the government at an appropriate time.”But if Mr Corbyn’s wish of forcing a snap election fails to come to fruition, the next vote is scheduled for May 2022 – and the prime minister has already said on the record she will hand over the keys to No 10 to one of her Tory colleagues before that vote.\u0026nbspIf he remains in post as Labour leader, Mr Corbyn will be facing his third prime minister as Labour leader. He chose not to name who his preferred challenger would be when Ms May resigns, however, and said he did not want to “ruin somebody’s chances by naming a favourite”.Asked whether he ever felt sorry for the prime minister – an emotion expressed by the former Labour leader Tony Blair – Mr Corbyn said: “At a human level I have great interest in other people and I often feel sympathy for the positions people have got themselves into.\u0026nbsp“But then I also look at her cabinet, look at the decisions they are making, look at the way in which universal credit impacts on the poorest, look at the levels of poverty around this country, and I feel angry and disgusted that we are just tolerating the institutionalisation of food banks, begging, rough sleeping in this country.\u0026nbsp“No, it’s a symptom of a deep malaise of 10 years of frozen wages and lack of investment.”Due to the unremitting sense of crisis at the top of the government and a prime minister struggling to retain any degree of authority, one of the criticisms often levelled at Mr Corbyn is that Labour should now be at least 10 points ahead in the opinion polls. Instead, the party is often on a level pegging with the Conservatives.\u0026nbspWhen questioned on this, Mr Corbyn replied: “I wish we had even more support than we do have, but we have fought many election campaigns, many local election campaigns, and we did win councils that people said would be very difficult to win back.\u0026nbsp“I would also say, generally speaking, the only time that the majority of the media have given us anything like a fair hearing was during the election campaign, and rapidly after the election campaign they reverted to type and we’ve had unremitting hostility from most of the media ever since then, and we continue to have it.”Referring to an incident in the Commons last week when he was accused of calling the prime minister a “stupid woman” – he later denied this, saying he said “stupid people” – Mr Corbyn said Labour’s strength was getting out its message through social media.\u0026nbspPMQs session\u0026nbspFollowing the bustup in the chamber, the Islington North MP said a video produced by his team the following day, which also criticised the media, received half a million views in just a few hours.\u0026nbspBut before he intends to build on the party’s social media output and daily campaign work, Mr Corbyn said he will bring in the new year with his wife, Laura Alvarez.\u0026nbsp“I don’t drink so there’s not much celebration in that sense,” he said. “We will enjoy the new year, Laura and I. We look forward to a new\u0026nbspyear.\u0026nbspAnd I always make sure in my own life that I\u0026nbspwork very hard at my job – and I do a lot of travelling and working and I love being a constituency MP – but I also make sure I have other things to do.

One resident, Lucas Espinoza,\u0026nbsp28, told The Independent: The whole sky lit up with a pulsating greenish-blue light. I\u0027ll admit that seeing the sky light up like that at night - in New York City of all places - put\u0026nbspa bad feeling in my gut.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe Con Edison power plant sits just a mile away from Manhattan, across the East River. Dozens of fire trucks and police vehicles were seen speeding down multiple streets towards the scene, as at least one helicopter hovered overhead.Some residents living in the streets nearby said tremors from the explosion shook buildings and rattled windows, while the resulting light could be seen from as far away as New Jersey.LaGuardia\u0026nbspairport was temporarily closed as a result of power disruption, with no flights taking off between 9.22pm and 10.23pm, according to data from\u0026nbspFlightAware.In a conversation with air traffic control, one Delta pilot coming in to land at JFK airport sounded unnerved by the situation unfolding just a few miles away.It looks like a massive fire, he said, according to dispatch logs cited by\u0026nbspNBC New York.

I drank a lot too.”But his poor diet - made up of fast food - increased his blood sugar levels and damaged the nerves and blood vessels in both his legs... and what happened next was his worst nightmare.One day in , Colin stubbed his left big toe while locking up at work.“The next morning I noticed it was discoloured,” he recalls.Over the next two weeks it got blacker and blacker to the point where he took himself off to AE.He remembers the frightening moment a nurse looked at his black toe and asked himhe was diabetic.I told her I was and she looked at me and said: Well, that will be coming off then.“I thought she was having a laugh.But what Colin was about to discover was that bashing his foot had triggered damage to the nerves - which had already become toxic due to the high sugar levels in his blood - and an infection was now travelling up his leg.Colin was rushed into surgery, and after a three-hour operation, he was left without two toes and the metatarsal bones in his foot.“I was so relieved the surgeon had been able to save my leg and most of my foot that I didn’t really think about the amputation,” he explains.My foot looked normal, bar two missing toes, and I went home and eventually started to walk again.But despite the seriousness of his situation - Colin continued to treat himself with cake and sweets.“I thought I had got away with it, he admits.But then earlier this year I felt really unwell and I realised that I had a huge infected ulcer on my right foot.Colin had started to experience the beginnings of more nerve damage – and this time it caused him to lose all his feeling in his foot.“It was only when I got to hospital that they told me I had been walking around on a broken metatarsal bone for a week without realising,” he reveals. “After some slight pain you lose feeling entirely.”After three months in and out of hospital last spring, he was readmitted in November after picking up a rare but serious diabetes-related infection called osteomyelitis, which eats away at the bone.This time, Colin wasn’t so lucky.“Within two days all the bones in my right foot had pretty much vanishedand they told me I needed to lose my leg, he says.It was gutting, but I knew losing it was the right decision.“I was awake the entire three hours,” he recalls. “It was only safe for them to put me under local anaesthetic, so I could see them at work on my leg in the reflection of the ceiling. I was curious, but it was strange.“The most disconcerting thing was feeling the vibrations and hearing the sound of the power.”Colin says seeing doctors remove his lower leg with his own eyes helped him accept the le-changing experience.“Seeing your limb being removed is not something I would wish upon anyone, he says.He describes coming to terms with the practicalities of doing simple things like having a shower and going to the toilet as “daunting”.“They’re things you wouldn’t normally have to think about,” he says.Just last week he began training with a prosthetic limb.“When I’m discharged after Christmas I should in theory be able to walk out of hospital and into my house and restart my le. I’m a glass half-full type of person so I’m determined to use this as an opportunity to become more well.”Before his latest stint in hospital he had been getting his diabetes under control – with balanced veg and protein-rich meals as well as cardio work and light weights with a personal trainer.“I’m much more aware of what food I can have,” he elaborates.Now I have one square of Dairy Milk chocolate once or twice a week rather than two or three bars in the space of a day.”Colin encourages other diabetes sufferers to not make his mistake by keeping active and watching what they eat.He warns: “You could lose limbs – or, worse still, die – and you’ll have yourself, not the NHS, to blame.”For help and advice, visit Diabetes UK.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This might not be good news to those who, like me, believe she has made a dog’s Brexit of EU negotiations, but it would be unchristian on Christmas Eve to ignore Mrs May’s transformation.She seems almost to have shrugged off the crushing burden of responsibility and begun to enjoy herself. Voters have noticed. At ious pre-Christmas gatherings, I have been struck by expressions of warmth for Mrs May personally, even among hardened Brexiteers.So, in the spirit of Christmas, let’s put dferences aside and raise a glass to the PM’s health and happiness.She has benefited from the ghastliness of her enemies — the thuggish European Commision, drunken groper Jean Claude Juncker, biased Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow and snide Jeremy Corbyn. Their mean-spirited sneers have stirred a passion for the underdog among fair-minded Brits — surprisingly, more among men than women.It is refreshing to see bellowing toad Bercow, a toxic stain on the centuries-old tradition of Speaker impartiality, finally at bay over allegations of abuse of his high office. Bercow’s blatant contempt for Parliament coincides with Corbyn’s disintegration and Labour’s irrelevance.Only last week Corbyn was held up as the scary monster who would eat us alivegiven the chance. Today he stands shredded for all to see, as a pathetic non-entity who somehow became Leader of HM Opposition.Corbyn feebly denies live TV evidence of him branding Theresa May a “stupid woman”.  He is entitled to his opinion but it is demeaning to lie about it. No wonder two of his closest MPs, Fiona Onasanya and Kate Osamor, have also been caught lying through their teeth. And they are just the ones brought to the attention of police.Suddenly, far from Corbyn sweeping to power as Britain’s first Marxist PM, polls suggest he would be thrashed in a snap Election, with the Tories regaining their outright majority.  But perhaps not under this leader.Which brings me to another reason to be cheerful. Boris Johnson has been cleared of trumped-up charges of Islamophobia levelled by Tory chairman Brandon Lewis, spurred on by Mrs May herself.In an article supporting the right of Muslim women to wear what they like, Boris warned hijabs made them look like bank robbers or “letter boxes”.As with much of the ridicule hurled at Boris since Brexit, this was calculated to undermine his chances of winning any future leadership battle. But the really good news this festive season is the panic beginning to grip those who want to reverse the  referendum and keep Britain in Europe at any cost.Project Fear has become Project Farce. Fanatical Remoaners, not Brexiteeers, can be seen as the real swivel-eyed loonies.Time is running out — and it isn’t on their side. Either they accept Mrs May’s dodgy deal by March  or we’re OUT. As Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom explains, MPs cannot block Brexit.Far from being frightened off, foreign firms are pouring cash into UKplc. Savvy tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon have bet billions on post-Brexit Britain.  More firms are setting up HQs in London than any other EU capital and Britain has been voted the best country in the world to do business.We have just marked the wintry Shortest Day, a symbolic turning point, with the best jobs record in jobless Europe while the Eurozone faces an economic disaster. We are a long way short of high summer.But every day from now until the end of daylight- saving in March, things should get brighter and brighter. Have a wonderful Christmas and a terric New Year.AND finally, the best news of all. Ex-Chancellor George Osborne was filleted live on Saturday’s Today programme by BBC veteran David Dimbleby.Perhaps expecting an easy ride from a fellow Remainer, Georgie Boy was accused of cutting and running after the  referendum – and using his Treasury job to feather his nest.Comparing Osborne to greedy ex-PM Tony Blair, Dimbleby asked: “Why are you following in his foot-steps by taking job after job and earning millions of pounds a year  You became prominent because you were Chancellor.It’s as though going into politics – which you aban-doned when it turned against you – was a pathway to what you do now, making a buck.”The sound of spluttering could be heard.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And now it appears asthe police have made a quite colossal error in arresting an innocent couple.We’re now told that there might not have been a drone at all.What is going on  Are we completely incapable of protecting our airfields It is staggering — and anybody using our airports deserves an answer.MERRY Christmas to Sun readers — we’re delighted to celebrate with you.Your donations to our Christmas campaign for premature babies have been warmly received, and you’ve helped us spread a little festive cheer in specialist maternity units across the country.Every year we are impressed, but never surprised, by your generosity.

Nine minutes und kounting!”Here in Brexit-crazed Westminster, that scene sounds all too familiar.There are now fewer than  days until we are scheduled to leave the European Union on March .As European Commission bigshots like to say: “The clock is ticking.”Heaven knows what is going to happen: Will British Prime Minister Theresa May — still alive, and even a little stronger than she was a couple of weeks ago — elicit assurances from Brussels that will help her sell her Withdrawal Agreement deal to a sceptical House of Commons Will pro-Remain MPs somehow force a second referendum that could stop Brexit  Will we sail out of the EU without a treaty The only thing anyone knows for sure is that this particular thriller must soon end.By March , we will knowthe villain has succeeded in his dastardly plot or  can again save the world.Because, let’s face it, we’re not going to let the baddie win.Pessimists tend to prosper in uncertain times, and British politics at present is very much a catastrophists’ market.Critics and doomsayers are agitating more noisily as the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal becomes more likely.We’re being told British shops will run out of food and medicines, aeroplanes will be grounded and the economy could shrink by as much as eight per cent that’s the Bank of England’s worst-case scenariowe leave the EU without a deal in place.Officials in both London and Brussels are talking publicly about contingency planning, while Labour and pro-EU Tory MPs have repeatedly pressed May to rule it out.In the last Cabinet meeting of the year, Work And Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd supposedly compared Brexit to a car crash and Justice Secretary David Gauke said the concept of a “managed no-deal” was as mythical as a unicorn.But doomsayers should hold their fire — Britain will be just fine.Evensome instability does follow a no-treaty withdrawal, it would be short-term. Le would continue. Chickens would continue to lay eggs.Trading restrictions work both ways, so any attempt by Brussels to punish the disobedient Brits by preventing them exporting agricultural goods to the EU might encourage the British government to find sudden reasons to stop the importation of German motor cars. Or Irish beef. Or French wine.Have you tried new-world merlots  They can be rather good. And good value.No-deal would, in fact, have tremendous advantages.It would allow Britain immediately to negotiate and sign trade deals beyond Europe.It would force May’s government to cut taxes to make us more competitive.It would result in a tremendous boost to national unity.Before the EU starts feeling too sorry for us — or too eager to see the back of us — it might consider that in the long term, it has far greater problems on the horizon than we do.When none of the doomsday Brexit predictions comes to pass, the EU will find itself in deep trouble — our survival, and success without the bloc, will highlight the intransigence of the Commission and may well tempt other EU members to contemplate quitting the troubled union.Because there’s no denying it is deeply troubled.Belgium’s government is in turmoil — yet again.France’s peacock president is having his feathers plucked by a bolshy populace.The German chancellor is soon to depart this political le.Italy and Brussels may have papered over their rancorous dispute over Rome’s spending proposals, but neither is likely to play nice for long.Spain has a hideous unemployment problem and poor Greece, the crucible of Western democracy, has lost control of its own affairs and is turning into a Third World country.Poland and Hungary, of course, are pursuing non-liberal policies that have earned them the contempt of the European institutions.And all this before we even start contemplating Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s hiccups.Britain’s political class may be in agony over a “Leave” instruction it resents, but the country’s electorate is markedly more relaxed.January and February  are likely to prove noisy in Westminster, but by the end of March — one way or another — we will be out.That James Bond countdown will end and our ab-dabs will start to abate.The EU’s nightmare, alas, will continue.The question in Britain will then not be “why did we leave ” but “why did it take us so long ”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some people think that to get  out of  out was a bit of a miracle.I think the world outside was expecting a bad result. But we never gave up.

It could have been me.It comes after Elon Musk filed a motion to dismiss the defamation allegation brought by Vern after the Tesla CEO launched an attack on July  in which he called Mr Unsworth a paedophile.The billionaire CEOs attempt to dismiss the lawsuit hinges on the arguments that Unsworth attacked Musk first and that the over-the-top insults were opinion and not facts.The extraordinary Twitter slur came after Mr Unsworth blasted Musks offer to help with the rescue as a PR stunt.When Mr Musk offered his help, he posted videos online demonstrating how a tiny, kid-size submarine could be used to save those stranded.But Mr Unsworth accused Musk of trying to hijack the tragedy and said the businessman could stick his submarine where it hurts.In screenshots of a now-deleted tweet from Mr Musks veried account, Musk said: Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.But, on July , Mr Musk tweeted an apology to Mr Unsworth and the companies he represents.But he took to Twitter again on August , this time to question why er Vern hadnt sued him in wake of the remarks.Yet on September , Mr Unsworth filed court papers in Los Angeles suing Musk for libel, and looking for damages worth £,.Unsworth’s defamation suit says the paedophile allegation was made “out of whole cloth” simply because Musk disagreed with the PR assessment.It says: “Despite his total lack of information supporting his  and defamatory accusations, Musk overtly conveyed to the world that he was in possession of undisclosed  and defamatory facts proving Mr Unsworth to be guilty of the accusations.”Unsworths girlfriend of seven years Woranan Ratrawiphukkun, , also slammed Musks claims that her partner had visited Pattaya or any other Thai area known for sex tourism.The local politician and businesswoman - known as Tik - told the Thai news website Coconuts: The news about him being married to a -year-old child is laughable.Tik, who shares a rural home with Unsworth near Chiang Rai, added: Vern is a kind person. He rarely has an argument with anyone, and everybody loves Vern.Weve spent our le together for seven years - hes a good man and such a gentleman. He thinks of others before himself. I cannot comment further. I dont have anything to say to him [Musk].Despite this, Musk doubled down on his vile claims against the hero er weeks later, accusing him of being a child rapist in an explosive email to a reporter.Musks company Tesla have endured a bumpy ride lately, largely attributed to the words and actions of its chief executive, with its share price dropping by  percent since the start of the year.Musk was forced to resign as Tesla chairman and pay a million fine in September  after settling a deal with US regulators over tweets about taking the company private.He will remain as Tesla CEO but will have to step down as chairman for three years."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/KH-COMPOSITE-MAP-WESTERN-EUROPEnew.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"russia wipe out britain us giant tsunami","story":"The threat involves a thermonuclear strike on Iceland’s , ft Snæfellsjökull volcano.This would produce a “super tsunami” capable of engulfing the US capital Washington, claims the latest issue of Moscow-based weekly ‘Military Industrial Courier’.The newspaper also featured Vladimir Putin on its front page.Another attack option is to swamp Western Europe using a similar thermonuclear strike on the volcanic island of Jan Mayen, readers were informed.Author Choro Tukembayev, a “scientist and military expert”, claims the first strike would collapse the south-western side of Snæfellsjökull volcano with a power that would force the Gulf Stream into reverse so flooding the US capital.The article is headlined Tsunami Targeting Washington - a reply to an earlier article about the “guaranteed destruction of the United States” with nuclear strikes on the Yellowstone supervolcano or geological rts on the US west coast.The Icelandic volcano is a starting point of a natural channel - and Washington along with the American eastern seaboard would be engulfed, claimed Tukembayev.“The natural channel is similar to a wind tunnel, at the entrance to which is a volcano.“At the exit is Washington.”A similar massive tsunami could wash over Britain and the west of Europe which is “particularly vulnerable due to the relief of the ocean floor and tectonic activity”.He makes the melodramatic claim that the “wrath of Thor” could be unleashed towards Amsterdam with a vast tsunami wrought by massive bombing on Jan Mayen Island which is some , miles from the Dutch city, some of which is below sea level.“There is a basin under the Norwegian Sea with aof , kilometres , ending on a shelf in the North Sea.“Depths undergo a jump from  metresto  metreson the line of the Faroe Islands-to-Trondheim.“From here to Amsterdam kilometres .”The ‘Military Industrial Courier’ has been used in the past by Russian defence chiefs to explain their ideas on modern warfare.This publication was picked up widely by the Russian mass media.But there has been scathing criticism in Russia, with claims the proposals were scandalous, anti-scientic and irresponsible.Leading hydrologist Yuri Dolotov said: “This is complete nonsense from the geological point of view.“The Gulf Stream is one enormously big flow of water…“Eventhe whole of that Icelandic volcano is thrown into the Gulf Stream, it will be like chucking a brick into the River Volga.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457086155-e1545930680112.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"michael schumacher 50 birthday ski accident ferrari celebrations","story":"The car maker said Schumi - who is still receiving round-the-clock care five years after his horror ski accident - has a special place in Ferraris history.Seven times F champ Schumacher will turn  on January .

But I can’t wait to meet them.”Just like traditional newlyweds, the happy couple appeared loved-up as they held hands for the live TV appearance.Discussing how physical they are, Paul said: “We’re always holding hands, always hugging and kissing. Its like I’ve known her all my le and this is like my missing link.”Encouraged by host Ranvir Singh, the pair then kiss for the camera but Sarah quickly pulls away before Paul says: “She’s very shy, we’re very shy.”Sarah adds: “Our first kiss was our wedding kiss and there are not many couples that can say they never even kissed before they’ve made that commitment to each other.”Paul, from Chichester, and Sarah, from Tunbridge Wells, but originally from New Zealand, first matched on the dating app on December .They spent the next few days constantly talking on the phone before the idea of getting married was raised by Paul.He told GMB: “The whole idea of marriage at first sight came up when we were texting.I’d never seen it [the TV show] before in my le but we’d connected on so many dferent levels that the whole meeting and physical attraction thing didn’t matter too much.“We’d both been on dating sites and apps and I think we’d got bored of them because everything seemed too fake and once we started talking and messaging, everything seemed so real.We were open and honest with each other - that to us seemed more important than physical attraction.“There are lots of things where you go out on date and you pick small parts out of people. You’re looking for reasons for why not to.”Their first face-to-face meeting was on Christmas Eve at Gatwick Airport - dressed in their full wedding regalia - before boarding a plane to Vegas.Sarah: “I didn’t know what he looked like. I’d seen three pictures. It’s all been a whirlwind. We got married the same day on Christmas Eve.“We’d talked on the phone a lot. It was three days before the marriage idea came up I knew. If you know you know.”They booked the Ballagio Hotel and Casino for their venue and although Sarah admitted the idea was “crazy” they were both determined to go through with it.Asked whether they fancy each other, Sarah exclaimed: “Absolutely,” and Paul said: “Definitely.”They both agreed they would have still marriedthey didn’t find each other attractive.Sarah said: “It’s about who someone is on the inside. You can marry the gorgeous man of your dreams and the next week, god forbid, he gets horribly disfigured - would he be any dferent He’s still the same person on the inside so I feel like it didn’t matter.”The couple say they’re not in love yet, but they’re learning.Sarah said: “I love him utterly as a person.”Paul added: “I love Sarah for who she is and just likes marriages across the world, we will grow to love each other.”Both have been wed before, with Sarah’s previous marriage only lasting six months, and Paul has two daughters aged  and , from his previous relationship.Its since emerged that Paul, who works in broadcasting, was jilted by his ex-finacee just a month before they were due to marry earlier this year.Paul said Teri Shurety, , from Farnham, Surrey, who runs a pet services firm, said he was left heartbroken after she broke off the engagement.He told MailOnline: “My fiance left me four weeks before the wedding so that was £, down the drain and I didnt get a penny of it back.

Plane-spotter Alan Meloy, who describes himself as a “nut” for all things aviation, stood on his door-step in Chapeltown, Sheffield taking photos of aircrafts above him before he noticed something quite profound about one plane in particular. Quickly snapping the unusual plane, Mr Meloy immediately recognised the jet’s iconic liveries and identied it to be the Air Force One, the plane of the US President.   At this point Mr Trumps Iraq visit was still top secret - he and First Lady Melania had left Washington DC under the cover of darkness in complete secret. So when Mr Meloy posted the image on photo-sharing site Flickr to seeanyone  had spotted it, he was met with some scepticism, as the plane was flying under a  callsign to keep the trip a secret. But when other enthusiasts spotted the image and also recognised it as one of the two VC- planes used as Air Force One, they cross-referenced it with tracking data and deduced the president was likely to be on his way to the Middle East. With the news being so widely discussed online thanks to the photo, a ban previous reporting embargo of the trip was lted by the White House, several hours ahead of schedule.   Mr Meloy, meanwhile, has found himself in a media frenzy on both sides of the Atlantic. Its one of those weird moments where youre right place and right time,” the former NHS worker told the . Boxing Day dawns clear and bright, the next thing theres an interesting airplane. Donald Trump headed to Iraq for a surprise Christmas visit to US troops, alongside his we Melania. Its Trumps first visit to US troops overseas since becoming president. Trump and first lady Melania Trump met with military personnel on Wednesday at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. He has made the trip despite the US Government being shutdown over a budget impasse as Trump holds out for bn in funding for a border wall. Trump recently announced that US troops would be withdrawing from Syria, a decision which prompted his Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis to resign. He also said about half the troops in Afghanistan would be heading home. Today Trump said he has no plans at all to remove US troops from the country.  White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted: President Trump and the First Lady traveled to Iraq late on Christmas night to visit with our troops and Senior Military leadership to thank them for their service, their success, and their sacrice and to wish them a Merry Christmas. Veteran White House correspondent for CBS Mark Knoller reported that Air Force One was boarded in privacy in the hangar and departed under cover of darkness.

The Labour leader says Parliaments  representatives shouldto Westminster on Wednesday  January - not wait until Monday  January. He said the move would stop Theresa May running down the clock, forcing MPs to accept the Brexit deal she signed with the EU. But his call is unlikely to have any effect because the decision to recall parliament lies entirely with Downing Street. And a No source today dismissed Mr Corbyns call as a silly demand. Mrs May signed the -page Brexit deal with the EU in November, but was forced to delay a Commons vote after it faced certain defeat.   She is trying to use the extra month to win round wavering MPs before the rescheduled vote in the week beginning January . But opponents have already made clear they are still not happy with the deal after attempts to renegotiate with the EU fell flat. They are angry at plans for a backstop which could trap the UK in EU customs rules in order to protect the free-flowing Irish border. And today its emerged thousands more firms could be dragged into declaring VAT under the deal, as the threshold lowers from pound, to pound,. The Labour leader said he wanted to have a vote as soon as possible, and accused Theresa May of trying to offer MPs a choice between the devil or the deep blue sea.   In an interview with the Independent, Mr Corbyn refused to be drawn on whether Labour would seek to extend Article  to keep the UK in the EU for longer. He said: Lots of things are possible, the EU has longform on reopening and extending negotiations, but lets not jump too many hoops when we havent arrived at them. MPs are due toto the Commons on January  after a two-week Christmas break, and will begin a new debate on Mrs Mays deal on January  - with a vote expected to take place the following week. Mr Corbyn said it was in Mrs Mays hands whether she should recall Parliament a week early, on January . I want us to have a vote as soon as possible, thats what Ive been saying for the past two weeks, andthat means recalling parliament to have the vote lets have it, he told the paper. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK. The Future FrameworkComprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - not exactly the frictionless trade hoped for Possible EU access to British fishing waters We would remain tied to European courts Wed respect human rights laws Visas needed for long term trips to the EU It has built in vagueness - kicking the can down the road for further negotiationsRead about the deal in more depth here.  But it looks to me the Government has once again reneged on that and tried to put it back another week. We need to have that vote so a decision of parliament can be made. What I suspect is that its a completely cynical manoeuvre to run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea. A Downing Street source labelled Mr Corbyns call a silly demand, and said: Following debate in the Commons, in the week commencing  January MPs will vote on the Brexit deal. Instead of making silly demands, Jeremy Corbyn should be honest with voters that he has no alternative plan, and only intends to frustrate Brexit - ultimately betraying the referendum result. His comments came as John McDonnell dismissed the idea of an indicative vote to find which Brexit options MPs would be prepared to supportthe Prime Ministers deal is rejected.  The shadow chancellor told the Financial Times such a move would run the clock down even further towards March , when Britain is due to leave the EU. Elsewhere, Gunther Oettinger, the European Commissioner and a member of Angela Merkels CDU party, warned that the remaining EU member states would have to stump upBritain does not pay the pound billion orce bill. Asked what impact a no deal Brexit would have on the EU budget, he told the German newspaper Westfalische Rundschau: It depends on whether, following a disorderly Brexit, the British would be prepared to fulfill their rights and obligations as contributors by the end of the financial year . If this is not the case, next year a medium three-digit million amount will be added to Germany.But he said it was not entirely unlikely that MPs would vote for Mrs Mays deal next month.

The little boy was hit after running out between parked cars onto a road in Swansea in July, and was sent catapulting through the air. Incredibly, the child escaped with only a broken arm and a broken collar bone. Wales Online reports that since then, the family have given permission for the CCTV footage to be made public. The video was shown to Swansea Magistrates Court, where the driver pleaded guilty for failing to stop after a road accident, and failing to report it.  The court was told the -year-old driver had in fact stopped briefly after his vehicle hit the child, but he left the scene moments later. Mitigating, Giles Hayes told the court the driver had been receiving support from the community mental health team, which he said would lead to hopefully a signicant improvement in his health, and that the defendant was committed and prepared to comply with any orders the court gave him.   Sentencing, District Judge Christopher James said: The child races out from behind parked vehicle giving [the defendant] little time to react at all. Clearly an injury had been sustained by him. After the incident he had been lying by the side of the road, and it was clear you knew he had been struck by your vehicle. You stopped after the collision and went to see him. At that stage he was with an adult you believed was known to him. Following that you got back in your vehicle and left.   You must have known he would have been injured by the nature of that collision. It is clear an injury was caused in the course of this incident, and I read a statement from the childs mother that he sustained a fracture to his left arm and collar bone. It did not necessitate any surgery and is healing without intervention. You did not remain for very long [at the scene] and left effectively without giving your details.   There is no suggestion that alcohol was involved and it is clear from the CCTV that the child unfortunately ran out in front of you. You left soon after clearing in a state of panic. You are genuinely regretful and remorseful, and the effect it has had on you is clear. You have been involved with the community mental health team and you have been having flash backs and nightmares, and they are seeking medical attention for your condition.   You did respond to an appeal to surrender and attended a police station. You are a hard working man with no convictions against you. The driver was made subject to a  month community order, and ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work. His driving licence was also endorsed with ten points, to last for three years, in addition to pound court costs and an pound surcharge. The court was also told there is an ongoing civil claim against the driver relating to the incident.

Mum Suzie Purvis was devastated when she discovered thieves had broken into her garage and helped themselves to gts. But after word of the break-in spread, dozens of people - including strangers - sent them so many gts that their living room was packed on Christmas morning, Chronicle Live reports. As it turned out, her sons, Theo, four, and Jude, two, ended up being given a large number of presents and had a magical day. Suzie was so overwhelmed with the generosity her neighbours showed that she has now decided to give the extra presents to charity. Suzie, of Hetton-le-Hole, Sunderland, said: I cant even begin to thank all those people who came forward and gave us presents.  We went from being heartbroken on Christmas Eve to absolutely overwhelmed the next morning. People were sending us gts all evening. It got to a point where I had to tell them there was no more room in my living room. Just a few hours before, Suzie had been distraught after she discovered their garage had been broken into. She had kept all her gts, including toys for her children, wrapped up in the garage. However, at around pm on December , she found they had all gone. The -year-old, a midwe, said: The garage is about m away from our house and I went to get all the presents in so the children could open them the next morning.  When I opened the garage, there was nothing there. Everything had gone. It took me about  seconds to realise someone had broken in and taken them all. The only thing left was a box of Jaffa Cakes. They took the toys I had got for my children as well as gts for friends and family. There were clothes, selection boxes, little stocking fillers and other presents. I didnt know what to do.  Suzie told family and friends what had happened, and rang the police. Messages were also put on Facebook and soon people started to send gts. A group of friends started organising presents, said Suzie. Then friends of friends and their families joined in as well, and we started getting gts from so many people, even strangers. People were sending toys, electronic items, Xboxes, bikes, scooters, chocolates, and lots of other things the whole evening and past midnight. People were still messaging me into the early hours. It was absolutely jam-packed here. I was totally overwhelmed by the generosity. And the boys had a magical morning. To see their little faces when they got up - it brought me to tears. It was very emotional. We thought our Christmas was ruined but all these people came to save our Christmas and it made it all the more special for us. It was just incredible and I want to say thank you to every single person who brought us gts. Now Suzie has decided to give away all the extra presents. The food items will go to foodbanks and the remaining gts will be donated to childrens wards at Sunderland Royal Hospital and the University Hospital of North Durham.

In emails obtained by The Sun, Meghan Markle discussed plans of how she would give the drug to guests when tying-the-knot with former partner Trevor Engelson in Jamacia, in .When a friend advised Meghan to buy a special bag for the cannabis, she reportedly replied “Already ordered ‘em. And teeny ones for the pot that say ‘shh’.” A source also told the newspaper that Meghan even helped roll the illegal drug into joints and placed filters into each before putting them into the party bags.  Meghan and her ex-husband are alleged to have purchased the drug from staff member of the Jamaica Inn hotel, in Ocho Rios.“It didn’t seem like it was really her thing,” the source told The Sun .“Trevor and his friends definitely had more experience with it. I think she is more of a champagne and rose kind of girl. It almost looked like she didn’t know how to smoke. “It is not something that was very much ‘her’, but it was part of the theme and the couple were very excited to have this surprise gt for the guests.  “It was a destination wedding in Jamaica, so they thought it would be appropriate and cool to supply this. She thought it would make it memorable. “She was excited about making that a thing, showing a cheeky side people wouldn’t have imagined she had, especially at her wedding.” Meghan’s estranged father, Thomas Markle, also confirmed the drug was given to guests earlier this month - but these emails confirm prove the Duchess’ involvement in the stunt.  At the time of the wedding, possession of marijuana was illegal in Jamaica. It has since been reduced to a petty crime offence, carrying lesser implications. Meghan split with Engleson in , before dating Prince Harry three-years-later.  Earlier this year, Meghan’s -year-old nephew Tyler Dooley was revealed to be a cannabis farmer in Oregon. He released a line of the drug called ‘Markle Sparkle’ in time for the Royal Wedding in May, hoping to capitalise on the ceremony.

The family have suffered festive heartache for the fourth year in a row after crooks broke into their locked garage and stole all their gts worth around pound,. Thieves, who struck on Christmas Eve, also made away with all the food that was meant for the big day. As a result Charlotte Bell, her husband and three children had to rely on the kindness of friends and family to pull together some kind of Christmas. The hard-working nurse now believes that Christmas is cursed for them because it was the fourth year in a row a catastrophe had struck the family. She told Birmingham Live that her eldest son Dylan, aged , noticed the break-in at their house in Birmingham when he went to put the bins out on Christmas Eve morning. He came in and said: Someones broken into our garage. I thought: Oh God no, I dont believe it, Charlotte said.   All the kids presents were there, along with the turkey and gammon which were defrosting and all the vegetables. Charlotte, aged , is training to be a nurse at Birmingham Childrens Hospital. They had spent up to pound, buying presents for Dylan, Oscar, aged four, and three-year-old Amelia. We put them in the garage because we thought theyd be more secure in there than the house because theres a proper security lock on it, Charlotte said. But theyd smashed the lock and gone in and taken the lot.   I was devastated - wed worked all year to buy the presents and some horrible people had taken them and ruined Christmas for us. Charlotte said luckily a few small presents were kept inside the house so were able to give the children some gts to open. Friends and family also chipped in and lent them money to buy food - including a replacement turkey from a supermarket. Christmas had already been disrupted by Charlotte offering to work on December , leaving the house at .am and not ing home until pm. It couldnt have come at a worst time money-wise because Id spent all my December wages on paying the rent for January and buying all the Christmas food, Charlotte said. Dylan knew what had happened, but the two youngest didnt understand it.   I couldnt really tell them because they still think Santa Claus comes down the chimney to bring the presents. But we still managed to have a Christmas, we did the best we could, but it wasnt as magical as it should have been. It was the fourth Christmas in a row the family have suffered heartache. Last year, Charlottes father died a few days before the big day. In  her -year-old husband Richards mother died. And in  Amelia was born prematurely and spent four months in intensive care in hospital.   The family relocated to Birmingham from Cornwall in  after Amelias spell at the childrens hospital made Charlotte want to train as a nurse. All we seem to do is have bad Christmases - its like Im cursed, she said. This year was going to be dferent, so for someone to come and rip our day away from my kids has really broken me. My faith in people and Christmas ever being a happy occasion has gone. Christmas is all about love and happiness, but its magic has gone from our household again this year. We dont have a lot of money, or a lavish lestyle and I work to provide my best. But I guess were all together and are happy and healthy, and that counts for a lot.

Alongside the photo he thanked his sister for making them look like the coolest family in the whole of the north as they wore their patterned onsies. Another photo shows him holding a glass of wine with his wedding next to the fire as he listens to the Girls vs Cancer podcast, presented by Rachels friend Lauren Mahon.

Tanya Buck of Basingstoke was struggling so much after moving into herthree-bed council house that she was unable to buy wallpaper or flooring to decorate her home. However, after she traded lives with a millionaire family who own a five-bedroom mansion in Farnham, Surrey, she broke down after discovering that Noel and Lisa Hogan had fitted new carpets after the week long swap. The part-time cleaner, who has three children Dylan , Faith,  and three-month-old Esme, cried as she read a letter from the couple who also offered to pay for decorators to complete the house. Tanya, who lives on pound a week was shocked when she counted out the weekly disposable income of pound, typically spent by the private investigator and his artist we. Speaking on the Channel  show, she said: “People don’t have this money much do they  A week  “That is half my year’s earnings. What do they do for a living because I want to do it ” For Christmas this year, Tanya spoke about her struggle to put food on the table for her family and revealed that there is not much cash for Christmas gts.   And despite the contrast to the Hogans lavish pound.m mansion, Tanyas council home means the world to her. Although it has bare wooden floors and much of the wallpaper is torn off, the mum revealed that the family previously spent four years in temporary accomodation. And this Christmas is the first time she has celebrated the holiday in a permanent home. During the episode the two older children hug their mum as she cries talking about their past of being homeless. Tanya said: “As a mum I felt terrible. As a mum you’re supposed to feed and clothe them and give them somewhere to live. It’s soul-destroying. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done and I think I’ll ever do.”  Teenager Dylan also spoke about his first night sharing a room with his entire family in a BB. He said: “I couldn’t sleep. It was a house full of strange people, you don’t know what they’re like and there’s not even a lock on the door.” However their fortune for this Christmas has completely changed and Tanya says it is one that they will never forget. Taking advantage of the thousands of pounds worth of spending money for the week, the mum decided to treat her family this year. Tanya took her children to a fancy French restaurant sampling snails for the first time.   And making their Christmas even more magical, she splurged on a ft Christmas tree for the living room costing pound. No expense was spared for their festive meal as she bought a turkey with all the trimmings. Enjoying a taste of Noels luxury lestyle she paid a visit to his favourite wine merchant and picked up a pound bottle for their dinner. And Santa was very kind to the youngsters this year, after Tanya bought her children a mountain of presents. She also remembered those less fortunate, much like her own family the previous year, and spent some money on gts for disadvantaged people.  Tanya said: “People are looking at me because I’ve got so many bags. “I’m going into nice shops and looking at the size not the price. It’s the best feeling. I want to do this every Christmas.” “We’ve bought some gts for homeless families. Some games, toys and chocolates. “It’s easy to see the sleeping bags in doorways but there are a lot of homeless kids in BBs, up and down the county. They’re the forgotten homeless. “It’s nice to let them know we are thinking about them.” Meanwhile Noel and Lisa along with their two children Amber, , and Aysha, , often spend the Christmas holidays in Thailand.   As the parents both grew up in council estates, they thought they would be more prepared for the swap - but were shocked at the state of the home. The weekly budget of pound. also came as a surprise to the wealthy dad. Noel said: “I really can’t believe that someone with three kids is living in a house with no carpet whatsoever in . It’s unbelievable.” He added: “That’s pound a day which has to all go on food. “I don’t know what we’d dowe had to buy nappies or anything . I don’t know how she manages.”  Noel and Lisa also became emotional during a trip to the food bank, where demands quadruple at Christmas according to the manager. Noel added: “You can’t help but be moved by seeing people coming on their last hope to get food for their children. But when they turn up there they are treated with kindness and people who say ‘you’re in trouble, we’ll look after you.’ We need organisations like that. After Tanya and her children ed to the special surprise from the Hogans, she revealed that the experience has left her with a positive mindset. She said: “At Christmas you realise what’s important and it’s love and family. Things like that you can’t buy. “Money isn’t what makes a person. It’s your morals, your work ethic.

The Met Office are warning of snow hitting parts of the country as we move into January - with dense fog possibly causing chaos for travellers across this weekend. A yellow weather warning for fog is already in place across London, south-east and south-west England and went into effect from pm yesterday -predicting to last until later this morning. Now forecasters are warning of icy blasts smashing into the UK this January thanks to a phenomenon called Sudden Stratospheric Warming .SSW refers to a swt jump in temperatures in the stratosphere and is often linked to the onset of cold weather in winter.  The drop in temperatures could bring about a second Beast from the East - with the first hitting the UK in February this year, bringing freezing temperatures and thick snow to much of the country. Jeff Knight, Met Office manager of modelling climate iability said: There is a very high likelihood of a ‘Sudden Stratospheric Warming’ around the end of the year, increasing the chances of colder-than-average weather in January and the rest of winter. We will keep looking at forecasts to know exactly when any potential cold, snowy spells will occur.  Drivers are being warned about thick fog arriving for the weekend, causing possible disruption to public transport - including flights. Met Office meteorologist Emma Smith said there will be dense patches of fog that will form quite quickly which could lead to some dangerous driving conditions. She said that temperatures could drop to as low as minus C in the South West, with the freezing conditions a cause of the fog blanket. The fog could cause some slower driving conditions, journey delays to buses and train services, and there is a chance of some delays to flights as well, she added.  Ms Smith said the weather will be quite cloudy across much of the UK, with the sunniest conditions across Scotland. Temperatures will be in double digits for most places, Scotland and Northern Ireland C, C across the north of England, C in the Midlands, and similar in the south, she added. It is quite mild for the time of year, tomorrow night temperatures widely are around C to C and that is what it should be in the daytime at this time of year.

George Nissen’s great-grandfather Peter Nissen designed the prefabricated semi-circular structures that were widely used in both world wars. Made from corrugated iron, the huts could be thrown up in quick time without the need for foundations and put to military use, mainly as barracks. They came into their own towards the end of the First World War, when the frontline kept moving. During the inter-war years they became popular with farmers for storage and there are still hundreds of them scattered around the British countryside. Now over  years since their were invented, the great-grandson of Major Nissen has taken out a new patent for them.   The -year-old has reinvented it into eco-friendly garden offices to cater for the ever-increasing number of people working from home. They still have the same iconic shape as the original huts, are covered in corrugated iron and are easy to construct without the need for concrete foundations. They are shorter into fit into an average-sized back garden and use sheep’s wool and plywood for insulation. Mr Nissen, an architect, said: “About two years ago I thought about redesigning the Nissen Hut to not only celebrate its centenary but also to facilitate people home working.   “Most garden offices are small boxes and we are trying to provide something a bit dferent. “The new huts are similar in design and shape but are on a smaller scale and are much better insulated. “I think my grandfather would like them.” Over , Nissen Huts were built during the First World War, with many of them being used as a makesht hospital as well as barracks. After the conflict, their designer was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his work and invention. During the Second World War Maj Nissen - a former mining engineer and inventor -waived any royalties after the huts went back into mass-production. Mr Nissen, from Queens Park, west London, said: “The original huts were designed to be easy to put up and to move.   “My great-grandfather was in the Royal Engineers and it was decided that a new storage hut was needed. “It had to be a building that could be put up very quickly with minimal foundations, but taken down when the front moved position. “After the war they were widely used by farmers and the Forestry Commission as outbuildings. “Then the Second World War came along and their production was ramped up again.   “At the time timber was used to construct them but that was stopped as the troops used this for the stove so they were double-skinned with corrugated iron. “My great-grandfather died quite young between the wars and at that point the business vanished and ious companies continued to produce them.” The new huts still have a corrugated iron roof but the main structure is made out of plywood. They have a floor space of eight feet by nine feetand they are eight feet high. The huts cost about pound, and take three days to put up. At least , Nissen huts were produced in the First World War.

Arriving at the emergency room, the coating of blood on Bobbitt’s arms initially led doctors to believe he had cut himself, but removing the sheet covering his crotch would cause the doctor’s jaw to drop’, recalls the victim. Dr. James Sehn received an emergency call in the middle of the night to report to the hospital and attend to Bobbitt. Really all I knew about this on the way into the hospital was that a penis had been amputated and the organ was missing,” Dr. Sehn said on the program. Lorena Bobbitt famously drive off from the scene with her husband’s detached penis in her Mercury Capri, and tossed it out of the window into a field as she passed. Incredibly, after an extensive police search in the area, Bobbitt’s severed member was recovered, placed into a hotdog box, and rushed to the hospital.  Following a nine hour procedure, doctors were able to successfully reattach his penis and the -year-old insists everything is “normal now” in his downstairs department. “I don’t want to mess with it…it’s been through the wringer,” he joked. Bobbitt has appeared in a number of adult films since the fateful night on  to show off his manhoods renaissance. Now going by her maiden name, Lorena Gallo claims the attack was a retaliation to her husband allegedly raping and physically assaulting her. Speaking to Vanity Fair in August, she said: “I didn’t want to teach him a lesson. “It was a survival. le and death I was fearing for my le.”  Lorena was acquitted of any liability on grounds of temporary insanity. She served  days in a mental institution and now heads-up a charity working to prevent domestic violence. “I couldn’t believe it, how someone could get away with hit,” Bobbitt said of the verdict. In a later trial, Bobbitt was acquitted of raping Lorena.  The couple orced in  after six years of marriage. ‘The Bobbitts: Love Hurts’ airs on January  at pm EST on ABC.

Parents Naffi and Racheli Goldman, who live in Manchester, were horried by the comments after they posted pictures of their daughter on Facebook.They had been told by doctors that Batya was not compatible with le and offered an abortion seven months into the pregnancy. A D scan revealed she had a rare congenital disorder, and the tiny girl is deaf, blind, unable to breathe on her own, and has a malformed skull and a twisted spine. Naffi admits he was initially frightened by her bulging eyes and unusually-shaped head. This month the devoted pair shared photos of Batya on Facebook, and were horried when they were slammed by cruel critics who said their monster should be killed. But the pair insist they dont regret bringing the little girl into the world, and are raising pound, to pay for her care costs.  Naffi, from Manchester, said: We were told to abort straight away and the doctors knew she would be born with a serious medical condition. They werent sure what, but they knew Batya would be seriously disabled. We were told she wouldnt make it through birth andshe did, would die in infancy. They said caring for her would make our lives unbearable. It was absolutely heartbreaking to hear and our world came crashing down.   But God is a creator and he doesnt make mistakes. We will look after the gt we have been given. When we saw the comments on our photographs we were horried. We didnt think people like this existed. What people were saying was dreadful. People said they have never seen such an ugly child. They said our child is a creature. One person said what we are doing is abuse and someone told us she looks like some kind of monster.  People said why bring a creature into this world, you should have killed her. It broke our hearts. The couple had been trying for a baby for two years before finally conceiving Batya. Naffi says they were delighted and couldnt wait to settle as a new family in Manchester. They said all the scans throughout the pregnancy were totally normal, until they had the D scan while visiting family in near Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel. Doctors said she would be born very disabled and would likely not survive, but her parents opted to reject an abortion. Naffi said: It was like an earthquake, a bombshell. We were so excited for when she arrived before the doctor told us we should kill our baby.   As soon as we walked out of the doctors office we said straight away that we will keep the baby no matter what. We felt as though it was gods will. Its what our purpose in le is. There was nothing at all to debate. We knew it would be hard but we had to accept our destiny. To us, aborting at seven months would have been murder. She wasnt a fetus, she was a real le baby. We were not prepared to take a childs le and we were defiant about not aborting.   Jewellery dealer Naffi and his we moved to Israel after the scan, to be closer to family. Batya was born deaf, blind, unable to breathe on her own, with spina bida, Pfefer Syndrome and Antley Bixler Syndrome, on January . The baby was rushed to intensive care and suffered respiratory failure during infancy and is now kept alive by a ventilator. Naffi said: She had an enlarged head and her eyes were bulging. I could see straight away that her spine wasnt straight. She was frightening to look at. It was scary for us. We knew straight away that the future was going to be very, very hard for us. This month, mum Racheli, shared photos of her baby on Facebook, and was viciously attacked by online trolls for going against medics advice.   The messages said things like do you think keeping this creature alive is the right thing to do . Another troll called Batya a sick fetus whilst one person said Rachelis baby looked like medusa, known in Greek Mythology as a monster. Both Naffi and Racheli have had to give up their jobs and spent   - in alternate shts - caring for their daughter. She requires  procedures a day that keep her alive - including round-the-clock medication and feeding via a tube. If her airways are not cleared every three hours she would suffocate. We do it out of love for our daughter, said Naffi.   We give her intensive care at home so we cant work. We do  hour shts between us. The government provide us with some equipment but we have to pay for a lot of the medication. We have to clean her ventilation tubes andwe miss a suction then she could suffocate. We work to keep our daughter alive. Around  per cent of children worn with Batyas disabilities die within  weeks but she has found a way to survive. And just like every other baby, Batya loves to be loved. Naffi, who is a grandfather and has a daughter, , from another relationship, said: She is a pampered baby for sure. She loves to be kissed, she loves to be held. She likes to know when people are around her. She cant see or hear so we try to be around her all the time so she isnt scared.   Her body has adapted to not die. She has amazed us. This is the hand we have been dealt. She has found a way to survive and we absolutely love her. The couple had planned to live in the UK full time and had begun applying for citizenship for Israeli born, Racheli. They hope to one dayto the UK to liveBatya is ever well enough to travel abroad. They receive medical equipment from the Israeli government but are trying to raise money to pay for extra care. Naffi and Rachel have set up a GoFundMe page to support their daughters care.

The claims were made in the Russian military weekly-newspaper Military Industrial Courier in its latest issue which also feature Vladimir Putin on its front page. According to the publication, Russia has the capability to blast the Snaeligfellsjoumlkull volcano in Iceland with a thermonuclear weapon.The paper says the attack on the ,ft peak would create a tsunami so large it could sink the American capital Washington DC. In another bleak scenario, the paper claims Russia could also strike the island of Jan Mayen in the Arctic Ocean swamping western Europe. But the article has been condemned by many experts in the main news outlets in Russia saying the proposals were scandalous, not based on scientic evidence and irresponsible.  The piece written by Choro Tukembayev, a professed “scientist and military expert”, suggests Washington would be destroyed due to the gulf stream running along the ocean between the city and Iceland. He says the strike on Snaeligfellsjoumlkull would be so powerful it would collapse the south-western side of the volcano and reversing the flow of the gulf stream to flood Washington. It follows similar articles claiming a guaranteed destruction of the United States through nuclear attacks on the supervolcano in Yellowstone National Park and geological faults on the countrys Pacic coast. Mr Tukembayev claims the natural channel running across the Atlantic is similar to a wind tunnel. At the entrance to which is a volcano. At the exit is Washington,” he added. A similar massive tsunami could wash over Britain and the west of Europe which is “particularly vulnerable due to the relief of the ocean floor and tectonic activity”, Mr Tukembayev said. The article then goes on to describe the wrath of Thor would be unleashed on Amsterdam - , miles away from Jan Mayen Island, which is controlled by Norway.  “There is a basin under the Norwegian Sea with aof , kilometres , ending on a shelf in the North Sea, Tukembayev continued. “Depths undergo a jump from ,mto mon the line of the Faroe Islands to Trondheim. “From here to Amsterdam,km .” The ‘Military Industrial Courier’ has been used in the past by Russian defence chiefs to explain their ideas on modern warfare.

Four points from a home game against Falkirk and a trip to Inverness is not a bad .“We had a little dip and the Ayr United game took us by shock.“We didn’t really recover the week after down at Morton where it was a pretty poor performance but we feel back on track and long may it continue.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/866573532_23823642-846x564.jpg ","title":"the vikings are coming galloway hoard treasure to visit dundee","story":"The Galloway Hoard, which brings together the richest collection of rare and unique Viking-age objects ever found in Britain or Ireland, is to come to Dundee.Billy Gartley, head of cultural services at Leisure and Culture Dundee, said: “This is very exciting news for everyone in the city and we are delighted to be working with Museums Scotland to bring the Galloway Hoard to The McManus.“This will be a great opportunity for visitors from the city and beyond to enjoy a collection of international signicance.

win last Saturday continues.Following that victory over the Jambos the Reds’ winning run of four games was ended by Celtic yesterday, the Hoops winning - at Pittodrie.After last Saturday’s game Levein felt Hearts should have had two penalties and accused McInnes of trying to get Steven Naismith sent off.McInnes disagreed with Levein and then, speaking ahead of their game with Hamilton yesterday, Levein had another pop at McInnes.The Tynecastle gaffer said: “I get on well with Del but this is the same Derek McInnes who, when I was on the phone to him three weeks ago, was crying his eyes out about the decisions that were going against him.”Levein intimated that McInnes had phoned him to complain about referees.However, the Pittodrie boss says that wasn’t the case and branded Levein’s reaction “irrational” and “childish”.McInnes said: “After what I said against Hearts on Saturday, he’s taken umbrage to what I’ve said.“It was more about the last game against Heartswhen they got two penalties – one was never a penalty and one was very soft.“Even then he was wanting four or five penalties.“On Saturday I was asked the first question when we won the game and I thought we were hands down the better team.“I was asked the question that Craig Levein felt he should have had a couple of penalties and I said ‘Hearts always seem to want penalties’.“If that is what has caused him to be so upset I find his reaction irrational and childish.“One thing that needs to be said, he has intimated and tried to cast aspersions that I phoned him.“We played Rangers on the Wednesday night , we won the game , we were off on the Thursdayand I was doing the school run and I had a phone call from him the morning after the Rangers game.“I was still so pleased with my team from winning.“You need to ask yourself why is he phoning me “He was the one that was the one complaining, he was the one moaning about the penalty at St Johnstone .“That was a private phone call, he has put that into the public domain.“The initial phone call has come from Craig Levein to me which I find surprising because he’s not normally someone I speak to.“He said ‘what are we going to do about these referees ’ I said that in  years as a manager I felt you didn’t get any real benefit from criticising referees.“No good can come from it. I got asked about the Cosgrove sending off and I commented on it.“I got asked about the penalty at Hampden in the cup final, should it be a penalty  Of course it shouldn’t.“I’ve got to answer when I get asked and I commented at the time and of course I was disappointed with the decisions at the time.“The very next dayI did my press conference and we spoke about how referees needed help with VAR.“I felt there was no benefit of continually criticising referees and make points after the event.“I have got to answer at the time so I find the whole thing quite irrational and his reaction a bit strange. For somebody who has done so much in the game and somebody who I have always had a high regard for, I find it really disappointing.“Each to their own – he said I was crying my eyes out, but he was the one who made the phone call.“He was the one complaining and he hasn’t stopped moaning since.“He cast an aspersion that it was me that made the phone call to complain. Why would I phone Craig Levein to complain about referees “You need to ask him why he phoned me to complain about referees.“It’s disappointing. I want to concentrate on my team and not wanting to comment on this.“But he put a private conversation into the public domain and that disappoints me.”Reflecting on yesterday’s defeat to Celtic, McInnes was proud of his team, who now sit fourth in the Premiership after Kilmarnock’s - win at Motherwell.McInnes felt Celtic striker Odsonne Edouard made a big impact. The Frenchman was a th-minute sub as the game went from - with  minutes to play to - at time up.He added: “I thought it was a fantastic game and had a bit of everything in it.“But I do feel the introduction of Edouard in the dying embers made an impact.“With our defenders tired a £ million striker comes on. His composure on the ball, running power, strength and freshness did pay idends for them.“You have to applaud Celtic for their attacking intent.“A draw may have been a fair result for what we put into the game, but the attacking abilities of Celtic played their part in the final few minutes.”Celtic felt the Dons’ second penalty in the rd minute when Lustig tangled with captain Graeme Shinnie wasn’t a spot kick.McInnes said: “I’ve seen it and I think it was a push in the back.”"},{"url":null,"title":"magnificent seven goals","story":"Despite defeat the Aberdeen players were applauded off the park at the end – a mark of the display they put in.Although they were edged out by the Premiership champions and leaders at Pittodrie, it was an enthralling contest where the Reds gave so much and were unfortunate not to come away with at least a point.The Red Army recognised that and gave their favourites the ovation they deserved.On reflection the Dons may rue poor defending. But they can be proud of the performance eventhe result was not what they wanted.The Hoops took the lead on six minutes. Former Aberdeen loanee Ryan Christie found a pocket of space in midfield, and his pass set Callum McGregor racing down the left.McGregor was away from Lewis Ferguson and his low cross was only half-cleared by Dom Ball at the back post which allowed Scott SINCLAIR to tap home from six yards.The loss of an early goal didn’t deter the Dons who kept trying to play on the front foot and use the pace of Niall McGinn and Connor McLennan on the flanks.After  minutes Shinnie was pushed into midfield with Ball going to centre-back and Andy Considine moved to left-back.Midway through the first period Aberdeen equalised and it came as a result of more success on the flanks.Shay Logan lobbed a pass in behind Emilio Izaguirre which McGinn latched on to. After the Northern Irishman had crossed Izaguirre clattered him and ref Willie Collum rightly awarded a penalty.Stevie MAY stepped up and confidently fired his right-footed effort down the middle past the ing Craig Gordon for -.Shortly after the half hour Dons keeper Joe Lewis made an important block with his right leg to deny Christie.Scott McKenna’s loose pass had allowed Sinclair to slip in Christie on the left side of the area, but Lewis spread himself well to block.The Hoops had more possession at the start of the second half, but didn’t manage to create any clear openings as the home defence held firm.On the one occasion James Forrest did manage to escape the close attention of Considine on the right McKenna’s block erted his low angled shot to safety.In the th minute the Red Army were calling for another penalty when Scott Brown barged McLennan on the edge of the area. Collum waved away the appeals but it looked as though the Dons had a case.On  minutes Lewis parried away Sinclair’s free-kick from  yards, but two minutes later Celtic took the lead and it was cruel.Sub Odsonne Edouard showed good hold-up play in the centre of the park, played a pass out to the right which Forrest got to before Considine and when the winger crossed SINCLAIR got between Logan and Ball to tuck home from six yards.But in the rd minute the Dons equalised. Shinnie lted the ball over Mikael Lustig and went down under pressure from the Swede. With May off COSGROVE stepped up and fired the spot kick into the top right corner with his right foot.Unfortunately parity only lasted until the th minute when Forrest slipped a ball into the box, McKenna cut out the pass on the slide, but the ball broke for EDOUARD to lt it into the top right corner from  yards.Two minutes later Edouard bundled past Logan and Ball on the left and his cutback was tapped home by SINCLAIR for his hat-trick.But Aberdeen weren’t finished and in the th minute FERGUSON volleyed home McLennan’s corner from the left from  yards.Despite having injury- time pressure the Dons couldn’t salvage a point."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/EE-DB-26122018-02-004-846x564.jpg ","title":"bumper boxing day as aberdeen shoppers flock to sales","story":"Shops across Aberdeen had a bumper Boxing Day as thousands of bargain hunters hit the high street with more of the same expected today.Shoppers were out in force in Aberdeen city centre as the traditional post-Christmas price drop lured them in.Boxing Day is one of the busiest days of the year for shopping centres in Aberdeen, with thousands visiting stores.Festive displays across the city centre have been swapped for huge signs promising hefty discounts.Ryan Manson, general manager at Union Square, said Next and many other retailers opened early to accommodate bargain hunters.He said: “The centre got progressively more busy as the day went on, with lots of people looking to spend their Christmas vouchers.“There’s also a lot of demand for our cinema and restaurants today, as consumers look for a day out after spending yesterday at home.“We predict another busy day today.” vw, px\"  Shoppers yesterday queued outside stores around Aberdeen before the sun had even risen, including Next at Berryden, where around  people waited for the shop’s am opening.Craig Stevenson, centre manager for Bon Accord Shopping Centre, said the mall had been busier than last year.He said: “It has been busier for longer as well.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this. One of the endearing things about the Europeans, and I say this as a Brexiteer, is their cafe culture. This type of activity would be forbidden in places like Jedburgh.ldquoWhen a family goes to the park for a picnic, and brings a bottle of wine, they are now caught in the battle between over-legislation and common sense.ldquoI would say letrsquos encourage cafe lestyle, and its economic potential for increasing footfall and destination desirability.Although councillor Hamiltonrsquos motion was defeated by  votes to seven, councillors decided not to submit their by-laws to the Scottish Government and instead opted for more research into the potential benefits and disadvantages and for further public consultation."},{"url":null,"title":"make-a-date-with-sinatra-and-crosby-this-christmas-in-selkirk","story":"THERES a chance to swing your way into Christmas this weekend in Selkirk with some of the best-known festive hits.Christmas Crooners is coming to Victoria Halls on Sunday as part of their UK tour, now in its tenth record-breaking year.The show features the renowned West-End Singers performing the famous Christmas hits of all the greats, including Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole.They will be showcasing over  of the best-loved festive tunes, such as lsquoDeck the Hallsrsquo, lsquoChestnuts Roastingrsquo and lsquoSanta Babyrsquo, bringing some old-school Christmas glamour to the Borders.Stephen Leatherland, producer and director of the show, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted to be bringing Christmas Crooners to Selkirk and the Border region.\"This fantastic show has brought joy to many people over the last ten years and more, and we look forward to bringing a parcel of Christmas Magic to Selkirk ndash the perfect start to the festive season for young and old alike.Staged in the warm style of the famous Andy Williams Christmas Shows, this production comes complete with Christmas trees, a rocking chair and fireplace.Christmas Crooners is a community-minded event that will bring people together in the local town hall over the Christmas period to celebrate all things festive, with top-quality musicians performing Christmas classics.Hamish Moir, events and programming officer for Live Borders, said: ldquoI canrsquot think of a better way to celebrate the festive season than by heading to the local town hall for an evening of recreating the biggest Christmas hits.\"The Christmas Crooners put on a top quality performance with the West-End singers and Jazz-All-Stars, and we canrsquot wait for them to come to Selkirk for a cosy evening of live music.ldquoWe have a great series of events running over Christmas and in  that would make great gts, and I recommend looking at our website to view the full programme.\"At Live Borders we want to help make communities healthier, happier and stronger, especially at Christmas time, so come and join us on December  for these feel-good hits.Christmas Crooners will be performing in Victoria Halls, Selkirk, on Sunday at :.Tickets, priced at pound., are still available from www.eventbrite or by calling  ."},{"url":null,"title":"council-accused-of-paying-over-the-odds-for-lowood-estate","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has been told ldquoit may come to regret its decision to buy what remains of the Lowood Estate after it was revealed that government valuers advised the authority it would be paying over the odds.The council has spent pound.m on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.Council officers believe that the site, as part of a wider Tweedbank development plan, will create  permanent jobs, and a similar number during the construction phase.The site has also been earmarked for a -home housing estate.At a full meeting of the council yesterday, December , its executive member for business and economic development, Mid-Berwickshire councillor Mark Rowley, told members: ldquoThis was a project set in motion by a previous council.ldquoIn , the previous council agreed to the purchase of Lowood in principle, and over the last few years, work has been developing on this.ldquoWhat makes this incredibly important, probably more important than it was in , is that with all the talk around budgets, the council can no longer just sit back and try to carry on carrying out services.ldquoWe need to take decisive and strategic action, and this is an incredibly bold, and good, large-scale development.ldquoItrsquos maximising benefits wersquore already seeing with the Borders Railway. It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption.

This was brought home to me forcefully by the response to a book I reviewed in , Enlightenment Now by the Hard psychologist, Steven Pinker.Pinker is a long-haired, Jewish, liberal child of the s. Yet for claiming in his books that on almost every index of human progress - health and safety, longevity, ersity, poverty, war, crime ndash things are broadly-speaking getting better, he has been subjected to widespread criticism and even abuse. Pinker has been accused of being a sympathiser with the ldquoalt right by commentators and fellow academics.Yet, most of what he says is undeniably true, even commonplace. Not only has absolute poverty fallen globally by nearly two-thirds in the last three decades, people across the world are generally living longer, eating better, becoming happier and getting better education. Improvements in the quality of le testy to the long-term achievements of progressive movements of the mid th Century, like social democracy, womenrsquos rights, civil rights and anti-colonialism.World poverty continues to decline far faster than anyone could have imagined back in  when white-clad demonstrators encircled Edinburgh aiming to ldquoMake Poverty History. Absolute poverty, meaning le below the World Bankrsquos level of  a day, may now be eliminated entirely by the end of the next decade.We think of this as an age of terrorism, with events like the Westminster kne and lorry attacks and last yearrsquos Manchester bombings. But while there were  terrorism deaths in Western Europe last year, there were nearly twice as many, , as recently as . The reduction is largely down to better policing and intelligence .The vast majority of terrorist deaths occur in the Middle East, though even here the number of fatalities has dropped by nearly  per cent in a year. The number of terrorist deaths globally last year, ,, is less than the number of Americans killed by drug overdoses, according to the University of Marylandrsquos terrorism research centre.UK road accidents have declined by two-thirds since the early s even though there are far more cars on the roads. Workplace and domestic accidents and other ldquoacts of god are down by similar amounts. lsquoElf lsquonrsquo safety may be a standing joke ndash but it has worked.This doesnrsquot, of course mean that people are not starving, being killed in wars or are experiencing health problems. Governments need to reduce road accidents even further, and perhaps self-driving vehicles will do precisely that. Nor is talking of progress a reason to ignore modern scourges like domestic abuse, opioid addiction and mental illness. In western countries, wealth inequality has been allowed to grow alarmingly in the last three decades, and needs urgently to be reversed to prevent social dislocation.Climate change remains one of the most serious threats to the future of our species, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in October. Nor has the threat of nuclear war receded ndash indeed, Americarsquos abandonment of the INF intermediate nuclear weapons treaty in  has made the world a more dangerous place. But recognising that problems exist should not preclude recognition of actual progress. Some problems, like the depletion of the ozone layer or plastic pollution, can and will be resolved. Climate change can be tackled, but notwe wallow in catastrophism.Remarkable things are happening. Last month, Scotland produced  per cent of its electricity from renewables, mainly wind ndash something that would have been inconceivable  years ago. One of the largest energy companies, ScottishPower, has promised to end all fossil fuel generation. CO emissions last year in the UK were lower than in the s, even though population has more than doubled. Market analysts like Blackrock are forecasting big losses in oil and gas stocks as the world moves towards green energy. The worldrsquos biggest polluter, China, is emerging as a leading force in renewable energy.Remember Band Aid  The country that sparked the conscience of the world, Ethiopia, is now one of he fastest growing economies in the world at  per cent annually. There are signs that sub-Saharan Africa could be on the brink of the kind of development revolution that turned China into the second largest economy in the world in only  years.Some may fear that the belated development of Africa will only lead to more pollution and population pressure. But that neednrsquot be the case. We learned in  that the populations of half the countries in the world ndash the richest ones ndash are now declining quite rapidly, easing long-term pressure on the environment.Of course, we shouldnrsquot be complacent, but it is a perverse politics that wilfully ignores what has been achieved. That just leads to passivity and public apathy: nothing ever goes right the poor are always with us the system always wins.

after ambitious plans to transform St Peters Seminary in Cardross into a cultural centre foundered, it looks likely to remain a forbidding modernist ruin for the foreseeable future.Architects have this week called for the A-listed building in the Kilmahew woodland of Dunbartonshire, an architectural masterpiece by Scottish architects Isi Metzstein and Andy MacMillan, to remain a ruin.For a decade the ground-breaking arts company NVA had appeared to have secured a new future for the lauded  building as an arts venue and, in long term plans, cultural centre.However, this year NVA, led by Angus Farquhar, has its long term funding from Creative Scotland cut in its controversial Regular Funding spending round, and the company closed this summer.St Peters, which appeared to have been saved from limbo, was seemingly cast back into perdition.Now the building, which has been a ruin longer than it was ever a seminary, is back in the hands of the Archdiocese of Glasgow, and this week a statement from the church offered no hope for the buildings long term future.It says: \"Over the decades we have tried everything to find a future for the former seminary.\"For a time it seemed the empty building had a future le: NVA staged the Hinterland project in the ruins in , and made a film with acclaimed artist Rachel Maclean, but its long term poundm project to transform the \"stabilised ruins\" into a cultural centre and performance space is over.Since , NVA spent pound.m on the building, and organised a series of works, including removing hazardous waste and asbestos, the restoration of  vaults, improving paths, clearing away Rhododendron plants as well as other woodland management in the  acre site.It is now unclear what will happen to these works, and whether any more will be done in the future.The building, an impressive and foreboding modernist ruin in the Kilmahew woodland of Dunbartonshire, is A-listed, and the World Monument Fund has it scheduled as one of the worlds most endangered cultural landmarks.Professor Alan Dunlop and Professor Johnny Rodger of the Glasgow School of Art said that its present form, as a ruin, is its most likely future.Professor Rodger, reader in urban literature at the GSA, said that the buildings original purpose as a secluded seminary for priests, had been rendered obsolete quite quickly by the Vatican  reforms in the Catholic Church from -.He added: \"It is a wonderful piece of structural virtuosity....but for the future, I have the idea of it as a ruin, maybe it is best left as a ruin, and a ruin to the hubris of modernism.\"It is not a place of pilgrimage, in reality is is quite inaccessible.\"Professor Rodger added: \"I remember going to Hinterland and speaking to someone there, saying I am not sure about this, its a lot of arts funding to spend in one place, its very isolated, just because of where it is.\"The irony is that it was built to train priests in isolation, and it will fail for that very reason.\"When NVA announced it was to close, Fiona Hyslop, the culture secretary, asked Historic Environment Scotland to study potential uses.The body has this week been tight lipped on its conclusions.However, the statement from the Archdiocese says: \"Over the decades we have tried everything to find a future for the former seminary.\"Its iconic status has, ironically, worked against it, as developers find it almost impossible to get the necessary permissions to bring the building back to le.\"We will continue to work with any group who want to look at providing some kind of future for the building. \"\"We have also spoken to the Scottish Government about our concerns and they have instructed Historic Environment Scotlandto carry out a review of the property with a view to securing the future of this architectural icon.\"A spokesperson for Historic Environment Scotland said: ldquoWe are working with the Scottish Government and the sitersquos owners to explore longer term options for St Peterrsquos seminary, which is a unique site of cultural signicance.Professor Alan Dunlop, a leading architect and academic, and a Fellow of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland and the Royal Society of Arts, said: \"My own view is that the work of NVA should be consolidated, the site cleared and St. Peters left, as Isi Metzstein proposed, as a beautul ruin.\"Isi Metzstein said that he would enjoy the idea of St Peterrsquos Seminary being stripped of everything except the concrete and left as a ldquopurely romantic conception of the building as a beautul ruinHe added: \"Angus Farquhar of NVA, seemed to have the correct \" little by little\" approach, stating in  at a seminar in Glasgow organised by the Architects Journal that NVA would aim only to bring a small part of the seminary back to restoration: the chapel and the sanctuary adding that most of the rest of the space would simply be consolidated because of lack of funds and that

precedence over our current Brexit-addled Government and, with the possibility of a General Election being remote, the only recourse democratically feasible is to hold a second referendum on EU membership.Jeremy Corbyns recent statement regarding his party winning a General Election in the new year and then re-negotiating a better Brexit deal than the present Governmentmust be filed under the heading \"deluded fantasy\" and is indicative of just how removed from reality his leadership of the Labour Party continues to be.It appears that doggedly pursuing the brainless and destructive path of Brexit is not simply the preserve of a zombie Prime Minister but also that of a zombie Leader of the Opposition.The Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, who is increasingly looking like a future leader of her party, has embraced Realpolitik and admitted that a second referendum is \"plausible\". As Mr Settle points out in his analysis, only a second referendum has the chance of winning a majority in Parliament and is therefore the only path open to breaking the deadlock inflicted on us by Brexit.When Mrs Mays Brexit deal is finally defeated on January , even she will have to admit that, following a delay to the implementation of article , there can be no such thing as a managed no-deal and that a second referendum is the only solution that preserves parliamentary sovereignty.Owen Kelly, Dunvegan Drive, Stirling.IT is disappointing to observe that the arguments by those who are in favour or against Brexit appear to be mostly driven by dogma or for possible political advantage by the MPs involved in the ious factions at Westminster rather than for us all to take a more pragmatic view of what is best for the country as a whole ndash within the general remit set by those who voted Leave in the UK-wide EU referendum.There also appears to a shocking lack of understanding about what is possible to be negotiated with Fortress Europe both in terms of an orderly Withdrawal Agreementand a final negotiated trading arrangement.Labour, for example says it could miraculously renegotiate the WA and would somehow remain in a customs union based on its belief that it would curry favour with the EU by being subservient to the EUs demands whilst on the other hand the SNP says it wants to be in the single market and the customs union. Surely to even a casual observer the above means Brexit in name only and would constitute a bad deal as we would become \"rule takers\" and be severely restricted to make fewindeed any bilateral trade deals with countries outside the EU. But when Labour is driven by wanting the Tories out and the SNP wants independence at any cost we have a problem for a sensible debate especially in a \"hung\" parliament. Then to complicate matters we have the relatively small but influential single-issue European Research Groupwho advocate a hardline Brexit and do not support an orderly withdrawal from the EU or any payment of the pound billion agreed by Mrs. May.Ian Lakin,Pinelands, Murtle Den Road, Miltimber, Aberdeen.BREXIT is such a serious issue that will affect our lives for years ahead that there must be an option in the January Parliament vote to give MPs to go for a complete withdrawal from Brexit and a referendum next year. They must go above party politics and recognise that the people, especially Scottish and Irish people who voted against it in  and certainly are not for it this time, can be given their voice.Everything has changed now. We now know what Brexit really means. This is being completely ignored by the PM, who is essentially blackmailing MPs to go for her deal with all the long-term consequences it will have.Alexander Boyd, Ormonde Avenue, Netherlee, Glasgow.PHILIP Adamsrefers to Iain Macwhirterrsquos reference to what Mr Adams calls the \"spurious mantra\" of Scotland voting overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. Far from being \"spurious\" or a \"mantra\", itrsquos a simple statement of fact which has profound signicance for those of us who wish to continue to benefit from membership of the EU.Unfortunately, however, Scotland is presently a member of a state which, to all intents and purposes, treats it as a sometimes useful but mostly to be ignored junior partner. Is Mr. Adams content to remain in that vulnerable, subservient position or does he not at least concede that Scotland will never have a chance of determining its own future without hindrance as long as the Westminster Parliament remains in overall control The numbers speak for themselves. Those MPs representing Englands constituencies vastly outnumber Scotlands contingent. Understandably, the former have their own constituentsrsquo wishes to consider and cannot be expected to show interest in affairs north of the Border. It has also become obvious in recent decades that Scotlandrsquos voters show support for progressive politics, whereas Englands voters seem to be content with a more conservative path. This widening split has become a chasm.Scotland may have been \"democratically outvoted\" in Mr Adamsrsquos eyes, but that is only because the UKrsquos political system is heavily weighted against it.Dave Stewart, Blairatholl Avenue, Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"a-year-of-column-debate-je-regrette-almost-rien","story":"Writing a column, to paraphrase the football pundits, is all about opinion.

And sometimes the columnist uses the lighter fluid inadvisedly.That was most likely the case with the column about Zoe Ballrsquos pre-determined take-over of the Chris Evans Show on Radio .

I had found it hard to accept black actors being placed in historical white roles ndash because of anachronisms. Some actors of colour agreed with the comment. Some pointed out that grant money is often a spur to casting.

But the  head will try to see past the colour of those playing our Stanley Kowalskis.The other column which saw social media go into meltdown came about after criticism of Gaelic funding. And the result was a meeting with Professor Wilson McLeod and we discussed Gaelic history, passions, and the social implications of keeping the language alive. Am I now studying Gaelic  Not at all. But I can recognise many of the reasons why the Gaelic voice is so passionate.But I know yoursquore looking for at least one act of contrition. Here it is. In the column Stressed: Stop Feeling Sorry for Yourself, I separated stress from depression. I argued they were dferent things. This was wrong. Wersquove so much more to cope with these days. We see the world so readily we canrsquot deny its confusions and disasters. We face a whole new range of problems, from the likes of technology, gender issues, paying the gas bill.

If you walk into any Scottish gt shops, yoursquore as likely to see Eilean Donan castle as tartan or shortbread.But for many years the castle did not look as it does now.  marks  years since the fateful battle which left the castle in ruins after destruction by the British during the Jacobite rising. years later work began on restoring Eilean Donan to its former glory by John MacRae-Gilstrap of Clan MacRae.Sitting between the three sea lochs of Loch Long, Loch Alsh, and Loch Duich, the caste has was used as a stronghold by Spanish invaders during the uprising in a bid to restore James Stuart, son of James IV of Scotland, to the throne.The castle was under heavy bombardment from British naval ships, for several days and eventually, after barrels of gunpowder were set alight, the Eilean Donan was demolished and would not be lived in for over  years.Dr Iain MacInnes is an expert in medieval Scotland from the University of the Highlands and Islands. He spoke about how the castle has had a long history of importance to Scotland:ldquoIt is perhaps its location that makes it ldquospecial, on the road to Skye, and regularly voted as one of Scotlandrsquos most picturesque castles. There is little doubting its ldquoromantic location and its general setting.ldquoThe fact that a castle appears to have existed in some form on this site from the very early middle ages suggests that it was situated at an important strategic location.ldquoIts access to the sea meant that it would likely have acted not just as a castle, but also as a harbour for ships connected to the ruling families in the area, from which they could project their sea power over the region.ldquoThis was an important part of lordship in this region, where travel by water was probably more important than travel by land. Its likely th-century origins also relate to providing defence in depth against Scandinavian raids and incursions in a period when Scoto-Norse relations were not good.Dr MacInnes also says that as with many of Scotlandrsquos Castles, Robert the Bruce may have paid a visit as part of his conquest of Scotland:ldquoClan history suggests that Robert the Bruce stayed at Eilean Donan in - on his flight westwards following his defeat at the battle of Methven, he said.ldquoThere is no corroborative evidence for this, however, and the temptation to be associated with the ldquowarrior king is quite a strong one in many clan histories, so this might well come under the heading of ldquomyth.ldquoAnd, as with many Scottish castles, there is the ghost of a mysterious lady also associated with it.

Make of that what you will.ldquoIts lsquolast hurrahrsquo in the Jacobite uprising of  is a pretty spectacular way to go out!Between  and , work began on the rebuilding Eilean Donan by Lt. Col.

As well as a footbridge to connect the island to the mainland, it was built up again to stand just as it had done for hundreds of years before its destruction.Now, visitors from all over Scotland and the world come to visit it, take pictures and even marry there, cementing its status as a Scottish cultural icon for years to come.Clan Mackenzie, along with Clan Macrae have a special affinity with the castle, as it was the stronghold of the Clan for many years. A Committee member of the Clan Mackenzie Society spoke about the long history with the iconic fortress:ldquoIt seems reasonably clear that the Mackenzies then lost control of Eilean Donan at some point by the first half of the century, they said.ldquoThen, following a long exile on the part of the chief, Murdoch Dubh, he finally seems likely to have recovered the familyrsquos power base in Kintail in a purported Royal Charter of  - which was purported to have been further confirmed in  to his son in a grant from the Exchequer.ldquoBecause of the Mackenziersquos power-base in this region it was chosen as the landing place for the Jacobite invasion which was aided by Spanish troops but defeated in the Glen near the Castle by the English General Wightman.ldquoThe Mackenzie, chief, William Dubh , the th Earl and nd Jacobite Marquis off Seaforth, played a heroic role in this Rising before being wounded and carried across the mountainsto exile and safety.ldquoThe MacRaes also played an important role in the history of the Castle, since they are a local clan who were the traditional bodyguards of the Mackenzie chief and their own chiefs had been the hereditary constables of Eilean Donan and were consequently dubbed lsquoMackenziersquos Shirt-of-Mailrsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"the-iconic-the-heroic-and-the-unforgettable-those-we-lost-in-2018","story":"The music industry lost one of its greatest this year: the Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin.

He painted wonderful pictures with words, as when he described a dense crowd, exiting Parkhead, lting him off his feet so that he ldquolevitated his way homewards.The best moments came when Connolly met his old mucker John Byrne for a wander round the National Portrait Gallery.

This was Being Hercule Poirot, with Phelps and her leading man delving into our herorsquos past to explain the man he became.It was  and an age had made Poirot a somewhat piteous figure. Long gone was his celebrity, his days of holding ldquomurder parties for the rich. When he started to receive anonymous letters warning of murders to come he went to the police station, only to be snubbed by the new young inspector in charge, Crome . When he finally did secure a meeting, Crome mocked him. ldquoMr Pure-oh, he said, making no attempt made to pronounce his name correctly, ldquoyou appear to be melting. Poirot wiped a drip of hair dye from his face. You could almost feel millions of viewers wincing on his behalf.The murdererrsquos MO was going through the ABC railway guide of British stations, killing someone in each town. Sadly, none of the towns were in Scotland. Had the murderer ventured north the ways of ScotRail would soon have stopped him in his tracks.

Alas, that was no invention.Malkovich was quietly magnicent as Poirot, Shirley Henderson was her usual impressive self as the sleazy landlady pimping out her daughter, and Rupert Grint, showed once again that there is so much more to him than Ron Weasley.

We also have to look at a number of other matters, including disabled facilities and safety issues.\"Mr Duncan thinks it will take between two and three years to get the project at Spittal Hill completed.The complex ndash which would have a standing and covered area for spectators ndash has great potential, according to local businessman and racing enthusiast Colin Calder, who hopes that a round of the British Sprint Championship could be held in the county in the future.At present, Knockhill in Fe is the only Scottish venue on the circuit ndash the others being in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Mr Calder is fully behind the scheme. \"It would be absolutely fantastic to have something like that in the area,\" he said. \"Caithness and Sutherland has a tremendous pool of talented drivers and this facility would support the up-and-coming ones as well. The track could also accommodate a number of other activities.\"He said the track, which is  metres long and eight metres wide, has been laid out but needs to be tarred.The layout of the track has been paid for by donations as well as money from the Baillie Wind Farm fund. A lot of the stone was donated by farmer and businessman Tom Pottinger.Friday  Dec  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118675.jpg","title":"Xmas hampers with a little muscle tow","story":"GYM owner Kris Hamilton will be flexing his biceps ahead of his annual sleigh pull from Thurso to Wick.Every year, Kris puts on his Santa Claus outfit and takes the role of the reindeer as he pulls a sleighful of hampers between the two towns.The hampers ndash which will be towed by Kris on December  ndash will be packed full of food, drink and clothing, and delivered to the elderly and some of the most vulnerable residents of Caithness.Its Kriss fth year at the helm, and while many applaud his fine efforts ndash the hampers being delivered to the east Caithness offices of NHS Highlands Care at Home services ndash they may well wonder why he takes on such an arduous task.Kris ndash who runs the Hamilton Optimum Training gym at Ackergill ndash says his motivation is clear.\"One moment of my pain could be a letime of happiness for somebody ,\" he says.\"Im effectively taking the role of the reindeer by pulling this sleigh ndash theyve got time off ahead of their main job on Christmas Eve ndash but its worth the effort.\"He stresses that at least hes got a sturdy sleigh to haul his good this year.\"The first year I did this I went from Thurso to Wick pulling a Tesco trolley full of goodies,\" he said.\"That was quite something as trolleys can be tricky to control in the shop let alone on the road.\"He underlined that the episode served as a good advertisement for Tesco, as it showed how strong its trolleys are.\"We average around  hampers ndash although were aiming for  ndash and were appealing for people to gather and donate as much food, drink and clothing as possible, as it can really light up someone less fortunates Christmas.\"If people are in a position to give, then they can donate what they can to myself at the gym in Ackergill.\"Kris is no stranger to fundraising as earlier this year he got down and dirty as he battled \"the Beast\".He added: \"The Beast Race is an annual km obstacle course race set around the banks of Loch Ness.\"The obstacles being mud, hills, marshes and climbing walls.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present. Unless the Minister agrees to think again ahead of Stage  consideration of this bill, that situation is unlikely to change.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Waiting for a train there has been grim.I also said you could in theory nip out to nearby shops for food or something to read, but that relies on knowing where to go, not having heavy luggage, having enough time before your train, and it not pouring with rain.It is for Network Rail to make good its sins on that score and complete the remodelling of the station in a way that not only meets but surpasses expectations - which will have rightly built up by then.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4849246.1545929408!/image/image.jpg","title":"scots rail bosses back young girl s invisible disability campaign","story":"A -year-old schoolgirl with Crohn#s Disease has campaigned for signs on the doors of toilets at all Scottish railway stations to raise awareness of #invisible# disabilities.Grace Warnock faced criticism for using disabled toilets by ignorant strangers - so she came up with a design which includes both a person in a wheelchair and a standing person with a heart, symbolising people with invisible conditions.Train operator ScotRail have installed ‘Grace’s Sign’ at accessible toilets in its stations across the country.The innovative signs can also be found at other locations across the country including the Scottish Parliament, VA Dundee and St. Enoch shopping centre in Glasgow.Andrew Marshall-Roberts, ScotRail access and inclusion manager said: “We are committed to making Scotland’s railway open and accessible to all and installing Grace’s Sign at our stations is just one of the ways we’re doing that.• : Diana Award for big-hearted Edinburgh youngster Cody McManus“Grace is an inspiration and we’re proud to support her campaign to raise awareness that not all disabilities can be seen.”Joe Fitzpatrick, Scottish Government minister for public health, sport and wellbeing, said: “Grace’s idea of an inclusive sign is a simple but effective way to highlight the accessibility challenges faced by many passengers.“I am delighted to see this inspirational young inidual’s idea put into practice on our rail network as it demonstrates shows the benefits of listening to and acting on the views of affected groups.“It would be good to see even more locations and transport operators implement Grace’s sign.”ScotRail has also made it easier for people who are disabled, pregnant or less able to stand, with a trial of pin-badges on the Edinburgh to Glasgow route, to make priority passengers easily identiable and to encourage all customers to be more considerate.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies. LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too.

The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland.

It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CIVIC-AWARDS-18-GROUP-1.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab.

Take some time to yourself, some time to reflect, some time to remember and some time to recharge the batteries for the New Year ahead.“Andpossible take some time for others, I have really enjoyed meeting people during my term of office and sometimes a kind word or deed, or just a chat can lt someone’s day. So this Christmas time, maybe call on people who may be lonely or those in need of comfort.“I also know that for many families, like myself and my husband, Christmas can be a dficult time. “It stirs up lots of memories of good times and bad, of love, and of loss. For those people and families, I have no words of good advice, as I’m still just getting through, but I will say, be kind to yourself, be kind to others, and do what is right for you. “I wish you all a very Happy Christmas and a Peaceful and Prosperous New Year!”* Bins scheduled to be collected on on Boxing Day, Wednesday, December , will be collected on Saturday, December .

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37660616.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/cattle_prod_seized.jpg","title":"cow prod used on pedestrians in northern ireland town from passing vehicle","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

What I suspect is that it’s a completely cynical manoeuvre to run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea.”A Downing Street source labelled Mr Corbyn’s call a “silly demand”, and said: “Following debate in the Commons, in the week commencing January  MPs will vote on the Brexit deal.“Instead of making silly demands, Jeremy Corbyn should be honest with voters that he has no alternative plan, and only intends to frustrate Brexit — ultimately betraying the referendum result.”Elsewhere, shadow chancellor John McDonnell dismissed the idea of an indicative vote to find which Brexit options MPs would be prepared to supportthe Prime Minister’s deal is rejected.The shadow chancellor told the Financial Times such a move would “run the clock down even further towards March ”, when Britain is due to leave the EU."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and diversions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat.

In  he sailed from Bangor to travel across Europe for  years, founding communities and monasteries.The cities and regions across Europe where his memory live on are joining forces to create a cultural walking route of which Newry, Mourne and Down Council wants to be a part of.The St Patrickrsquos Way route mdash which links key sites associated with the saint across the district mdash could form part of the proposed new cultural route linked to Columbanus.The proposed feasibility study will examine the merits of getting involved in the ambitious project, with support from the other three local authorities.Members of the local councilrsquos Economic, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were told on Monday night that the feasibility study will also look at the marketing opportunities the new cultural walking route presents and, signicantly, the level of investment required to ensure the walking route can attract international visitors to Down and other parts of the province.Councillors were told the study will examine the amount of money required to finance what has been described as a ldquohigh quality visitor experience and what services and facilities walkers would require which are not currently available.News of the feasibility study comes just a week after Newry, Mourne and Down Council gave its support for a new campaign aimed at restoring the former Ulster Way walking route to link Killyleagh with Strangford via Downpatrick.Local politicians say they recognise the importance of this particular project and its potential for increasing the number of tourists to the area, with the proposal described as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.Politicians agreed that council officials start work on the project to help restore the Ulster Way which would reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.They say a huge investment will not be required to restore a series of off-road paths, with the route requiring the provision of several sections of boardwalk to reconnect existing paths over boggy ground.Cllr Cadogan Enright said restoring local sections of the former Ulster Way could reconnect what he described as the ldquojewels in the crown of East Down.Moving forward, he said Newry, Mourne and Down Council needed to prioritise the required work as part of a cross departmental plan ldquoto have any hope of success within a reasonable timescale..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Yuletide festivities  ","story":"ITrsquoS going to be a busy festive season for Ballynahinch sports fans.Not only are Ballynahinch Olympic involved in two major football finals inside  hours, but the townrsquos hockey club are also through to a Yuletide showpiece decider.The Olympic seconds team face Celtic Bhoys in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final at Drumaness on Boxing Day.Twenty four hours later the Olympic firsts take on Crumlin Star in the Border Cup final at Seaview.The Ballynahinch club will be hoping to emulate Drumaness Mills who won both finals in .Athletics is catered for with the Castlewellan Parkrun taking place this Saturday before Newcastle ACrsquos highly popular Christmas Cracker race in Castlewellan on Saturday, December .Just for good measure, Downrsquos senior Gaelic footballers open their McKenna Cup campaign away to Cavan on Sunday, December , and Tollymore Unitedrsquos youth teams are involved in two Lisburn Youth League cup finals.Both games will be played at the Lisburn Leisure Centre pitches and it is sure to be a great day of football for everyone involved with the club.

However, the Irish government is still operating under a -year rule. That means that while UK files now being declassied are from , each year the Irish files lag further behind and Dublin is only now declassying documents from . That has led to a concern that the British version of history is emerging first, leaving the Republic at a disadvantage, and there are plans to speed up the process by which the Republic’s files are released.The files are released based on the year in which they were closed but such files may contain documents which go back several years or a stray file from much earlier.There have been  files fully declassied in Belfast. A further  files have been partially opened, with either sections blacked out or pages removed. There are  files which remain fully closed. Some of those relate to either inidual prisoner files or those which relate to honours.Those files fully closed in Belfast include ‘Kinsale Gas – Capital contributions to ROI -’, ‘Female representation on public bodies -’ and ‘Privatisation – SIO – Special Enquiries from the public -”.The files include both Northern Ireland Officefiles and those from direct rule departments such as agriculture, environment and education.From today, any member of the public can visit PRONI’s state-of-the-art building in Titanic Quarter and view the original files for themselves.Declassied files: Priest’s claim of  secret UVF-IRA Army Council talksMan arrested after crashing car into Coalisland pizza shop Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingMan who died in single vehicle collision is namedPedestrian dies after road collisionMain road closed in both directions after lsquoserious traffic accidentrsquoSudden passing of Deane Burrell on Christmas Day shocks communityWoman arrested on suspicion of murdering two young children          ..

Army Council in  to discuss the prospect of a federal Ireland, according to a document in a declassied Irish government file.According to the document, marked “Secret” which was released under the Republic’s -year rule, the meetings were facilitated by Father John Murphy, a chaplain in the Maze Prison.Fr Murphy said that the talks had started inside the Maze Prison before moving beyond the prison wallsThe memo, written to the Taoiseach’s Office in November , said that Fr Murphy was anxious to keep the meetings secret and listed the three main enemies of the talks as “the NIO, the RUC and the DUP”.“Fr Murphy was frankly surprised at the speed with which events had moved and was particularly surprised at the signs of apparent flexibility being shown by the UVF in this exercise where they demonstrated a willingness to at least talk about a wide range of possible future arrangements for Ireland, not excluding concepts like a federal Ireland ... based on the four provinces including a nine-county Ulster with a separate province-type arrangement for Dublin similar to the District of Columbia in the US,” Brendan Mahon, of the Anglo Irish Division wrote.“John Murphy has now informed me on a highly-confidential basis that these talks have now moved outside of the confines of the prison and that the Army Council of the IRA and the leadership of UVF have now agreed to separate talks with the chaplains outside of the prison.” The papers state that neither the UDA nor the INLA were involved in the talks, which were indicated to have started in the summer of , with the UVF wanting to exclude the UDA due to a state of confusion within the organisation and “to their fears regarding the level of security force penetration of the UDA”.However, it was indicated that UUP leader James Molyneaux knew about the talks and Fr Murphy “did not expect any trouble” from him. Mr Mahon indicated he felt Mr Molyneaux had given the “OK” regarding the initiative.Around the same time as the memo was written, it was noted that unionist protests against the Anglo-Irish Agreement were less well supported than previous years.Fr Murphy also claimed that the flexibility being shown by the UVF was “indicative of the general uncertainty among loyalists as regards their future in a changed Anglo Irish relationship”.Catholic bishops were kept in the dark, with the news that the talks had moved outside the prison kept to “the leadership of the IRA and UVF, two chaplains and now, ourselves”.Mr Mahon wrote that it was “extremely interesting” that “the military leadership of the IRA[is] in talks with the most hardline loyalist paramilitary organisation”.Dr Aaron Edwards, author of the  book ‘UVF: Behind the Mask’, told the News Letter that the signicance of the ‘talks’ is dficult to assess.He said: “If it was on an inter-organisational basis between senior UVF prisoners and IRA prisoners inside the Maze it would have likely been sanctioned by the UVF leadership and could be potentially quite revealing ...it was merely a seminar between prison house intellectuals then it would have less signicance. The indication of UVF meetings with ‘the IRA Army Council’ is uncorroborated and unlikely given that the UVF did not sanction contact via Fr Alec Reid until .”Reported This Week  Years Ago in the Belfast News LetterDeclassied files: Dublin now lagging six years behind UK in revealing state papers Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingMan who died in single vehicle collision is namedPedestrian dies after road collisionMain road closed in both directions after lsquoserious traffic accidentrsquoSudden passing of Deane Burrell on Christmas Day shocks communityWoman arrested on suspicion of murdering two young children          ..

It includes younger and older swimmers, male and female, with a range of abilities who swim every day come rain, hail or snow.Martin Strain said the group has been going informally for eight years but has grown notably in the last three. He said cold water plungeshelp members who have mental health issues.In Bangor, the Brompton Belles and Beaux have a core who swim every day at am. Marie-Therese Davis-Hanson started the group in  and said numbers have rocketed.One of the newest groups is Team Dash and Splash, whose members run along the coast before a plunge at Pickie Beach, Bangor on Sunday morning. Member and former Olympic swimmer Andrew Bree said it has been a big change from the warm indoor pools of his competitive career.“The water temperature gets down to around four five degrees in February and March here,” he said.“I got injured in  and left the sport not the way I wanted to and I think that affected me, but now I have found that love for the water again.“It strips the ego, when you get into the cold, there is no room for the past, there is no room for thoughts, you are focused on the present moment.Family’s thanks for Parker’s gt of le Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“My benefit was definitely mental, but there has also been a cardiovascular benefit, I have taken up more running and things I didn’t use to do. I come from a swimming background but I never liked running.“I think it’s from the cold, you are pumping that blood through the body, I just feel overall really good from it.”Dash and Splash founder Scott Riley said it started with a Facebook post in October .“I was going for a run and sea swim anyway, I got really interested in the health benefits of cold water and I was training to become a Wim Hof method instructor at that time which is a breathing and cold training technique for strengthening the nervous system,” he said.“The first week,  people turned up. It has grown and grown ever since. Even in January February there were - people turning up each week.“At our anniversary swim in October we had  people taking part.“There seems to be a push towards more outdoor activity, I think people intuitively know that it’s good for them, and maybe a societal sht where back in the day kids used to go out and get involved in nature, then computers came along and people got more indoor-oriented, but now the pendulum is shting back and people are realising that getting outdoors makes you happier, healthier and stronger.”try catch  TrendingMissing person found safe and wellEx-Isle of Man TT racer and TV presenter Guy Martin denies having fake Irish driving licenceGalgorm Resort and Spa evacuatedTwo stabbed: Man arrested on suspicion of attempted murderBrit-bashing by Irish will not change: Wilson          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was indeed a thanksgiving service for a le well lived and the family have been encouraged by the hundreds of messages of support from all over the country.One message in particular spoke volumes for the regard in which Niall was held. It came from a long-serving worker and it spoke of the love for him, mentioning in particular the Christmas morning phone calls he made every year to the workers. “That was typical of him,” said the letter. “He was much more than a boss to the workers. He cared for them and was always interested in their welfare. He often phoned many of them on Christmas morning to wish them well.” During his childhood, the Irwin family lived at Woodhouse Street, beside the family bakery business.Niall attended Portadown College and from an early age it was evident that he was keen to join the family bakery business.In , when he was , he moved to Leeds to attend Thomas Danby College to study City and Guilds Bakery Diploma. During his time there, he learnt extensive baking knowledge as he got access to a range of bakeries on the mainland, including small craft business and chocolatiers to larger plant bakeries and this knowledge would stand him in good stead for the future.He ed home from Leeds in  to begin his career as production manager in the family business. These were dficult times in Northern Ireland but there was a strict ‘no politics’ policy in the bakery and Niall and his father, Kenneth Irwin, ensured there was a workforce from all the community and the bakery still carries that ethos today.Niall introduced new techniques and equipment and was always seeking methods to improve the bakery. He and his brother Brian, who joined the firm in , established the Irwin brand as one of the most successful in the country.He also contributed much to the bakery industry body, the Northern Ireland Bakery Council. With Manufacturing NI he played a signicant role in retaining the Industrial De-rating policy for local manufacturers.Manufacturing Northern Ireland’s chief executive Stephen Kelly said, “Niall was enormously generous to many groups and causes, particularly in sharing his experience, time and considerable wisdom. And that was very evident in the campaign to retain the industrial derating.Cocaine seized at Belfast City Airport ‘could be worth £.m’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“He enjoyed holding people to account and was a fierce advocate for the sector, ensuring that the conditions were right to allow firms to grow and to compete in markets at home and abroad and provide jobs. He contributed much in making great bread and bakery products and a better Northern Ireland.“He will be hugely missed by all those who worked with him.”Niall contributed his time generously to the Irish bakery trade. He was an energetic President of the Irish Association of Master Bakers in  and he was held in such esteem in the bakery business throughout these islands that he was awarded Honorary Le Membership of the Scottish Bakers Association. Last year he and brother Brian attended the Bakers Hall in London where they were both clothed in the Livery of the Worshipful Company of Bakers, giving them the honour of becoming Freemen of the City of London.One of Niall’s biggest challenges was helping oversee Irwins bakery move from Woodhouse Street to new premises in Carn in  and it says much of his and the other directors expertise that the move was made seamlessly with no loss of production.Mr Michael Murphy, chief executive officer at Irwins, joined in the tributes and he said, “Niall was passionate about work and extending his family values to the people who worked in the bakery. We are very much a family business and Niall was at the heart of this.“He was interested in everyone, no matter who you were, what you did or where you came from and he was always interested in seeing the young people progress. He would walk all the lines and by lunch-time he knew everything that was going on right across the business, both inside and out.“He was enormously generous to many people, groups and causes, sharing his experience, time and considerable wisdom. He was the heart of the bakery and he will be greatly missed.”As well as the bakery business, Niall took much pride at the progress of Irwin’s sand and aggregate business.But his le wasn’t all about work and outside the bakery business he was generous with his time and money to many causes. He travelled to Uganda in  with Fields of Le and became involved with the Water Of Le projects raising money for water well drilling rigs. He also fundraised tirelessly for the Irish Bakers Benevolent Society.On the sporting front he was President of Portadown Boat Club, where he was a driving force in the development of the club.The service was conducted by the minister of Edenderry Methodist Church, the Rev Alan Wardlow and there was a reading by family friend, Peter Thompson. Wilson Graham was the soloist.Niall is survived by his we, Kay, sons Ross and Stewart, sister Lyn and brother Brian. He was predeceased by his parents, Kenneth and Patsy.Ross said, “We have been greatly touched by all the tributes to Niall and we want everyone to know that we are very grateful for all the messages of sympathy.”He is interred at Kernan Cemetery.Donations in lieu of flowers are to Cancer Focus NI, c o Milne Funeral Services, , Seagoe Road, Portadown, BT HS.try catch  TrendingGang of racist youths attack familyTraffic at a standstill as emergency services deal with lsquoseriousrsquo crashFirefighters from Portadown and Lurgan use hydraulic cutter to rescue man after road traffic collisionRoad remains closed as one person rushed to hospitalTraffic ersions for those wishing to visit Rushmere or Portadown          ..

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
