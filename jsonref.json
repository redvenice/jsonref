The brash young American boxer told reporters it would take only five rounds to finish off Britain’s Henry Cooper in their first contest in 1963 – as displayed in this memorable image by Gerry Cranham, shot at a training hall in Shepherd’s Bush. However, the fight didn’t exactly go to plan. In the final seconds of the fourth round, it was Clay who hit the deck, dizzied by a left hook from his bloodied opponent. He was so badly shaken, in fact, that myth has it his trainer, Angelo Dundee, surreptitiously worsened a tear in his gloves, forcing an inspection between the rounds that bought his fighter valuable extra seconds in which to recover.

And I don’t think there is more to say,” he said.Ocado was not banking a windfall from the surge in online grocery sales, he said, and had not benefited from government assistance such as business rates relief or the delay of VAT payments. The company has not furloughed staff under the government job protection scheme.“We’ve really done our bit and tried to scale up. If we could have scaled faster we would have done. We will keep trying to do more,” Tatton-Brown said.Ocado was “outperforming” other supermarkets in offering help to shoppers shielding at home with deliveries to 150,000 vulnerable families, he said. “We know we are serving more than our share.”Efficiency has been helped by customers buying more of the same items – often stocking up for neighbours or family members – while Ocado has trimmed ranges and limited orders on bulky items, such as mineral water, to create more space in its delivery vans.Tatton-Brown said Ocado had hired engineering contractors to speed up work on its warehouses to help meet demand, including two new sites and the rebuilding of one in Andover, which burned down last year. “We are seeing a lot of extra costs,” he said.Despite delays caused by the need for safeguarding for construction workers during the pandemic, he said the facilities would be completed on time next year. Ocado expected to begin delivering groceries for its new partner, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, in the autumn as planned, he added.Tatton-Brown said Ocado had not increased prices, aside from dropping multi-buy offers in line with the rest of the market.He said customers were putting more in their online baskets on each visit. While the amount spent has fallen from the peak in mid-March when families were preparing for lockdown, shoppers are still spending more than usual because they are not dining out and buying sandwiches for lunch.He said the mix of goods ordered had changed, with the emphasis on pasta, tins and toilet roll in the early days of the pandemic having switched to include more chocolate, wine and other discretionary products."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/048da9748bc7b24adfaf7888bfa422d127421d4e/0_0_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96b47442b208ce2da560b5e066c8997d","title":"small firms bounce back loans businesses coronavirus","story":"More than 69,000 struggling UK businesses get funding from coronavirus schemeSmall businesses have secured more than 69,000 government-backed loans worth in excess of £2bn in the first 24 hours of the scheme’s launch.The number of applications surged to more than 200,000 by Tuesday evening, according to a  tally of inidual lenders. The Treasury said banks were trying to process applications as quickly as possible.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: “These loans will help them bounce back from this crisis, getting money fast, so it’s great to see close to 70,000 businesses benefiting in just the first day. It’s vital this speedy progress continues in the days and weeks ahead.”The Treasury’s figures suggest there is ample demand for cheap government cash among small businesses. Applications via the fast-track scheme, which involves a simple online form, far exceed those made through the much-criticised coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS).According to the latest data, UK lenders have received 52,807 formal CBILS applications and approved 25,262 CBILS loans worth £4.1bn since that scheme’s launch on 23 March. The programme – which requires additional checks and processing, and has varying interest rates and a lower government guarantee – has been criticised for being too slow in getting cash to small and medium-sized businesses that need it most.However, the bounce-back loan scheme has also been criticised for approving issuance by a small number of lenders before its launch, compared with the 40 lenders that were authorised for CBILS at the start of the original programme.The state-owned British Business Bank, which is managing the scheme, has so far accredited only eight lenders to dole out funds, including Lloyds, Santander, Virgin Money UK, TSB, Danske Bank and Barclays.Most of those lenders are restricting loans to their business customers, raising fears that many small businesses that hold accounts with other banks could end up being locked out of the scheme.HSBC and RBS are accepting external applicants for the emergency cash loans but they are still prioritising their account holders.The British Business Bank expects to accredit more lenders over the coming weeks but has not confirmed how many have applied.Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said despite a “promising start” for the bounce-back scheme, some firms were still reporting difficulties.“Unfortunately, we are hearing reports that bounce-back application forms are hard to access or inquiries are simply being acknowledged with a ‘We’ll call you’ message and nothing further,” he said.“Many of the most vulnerable business owners – particularly sole traders – only have personal banks accounts and, as a result, are being told they cannot access a bounce-back loan. It’s vital that they are helped to secure the finance on which many will depend to make it through this incredibly challenging time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/045fa9ca790cd168270fec8ad45d2747f1c6d25a/0_22_4599_2761/master/4599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd6c1c6544cac4244473be3a9ffab9ef","title":"coronavirus uk university finances student numbers","story":"Without action, this crisis and the collapse in international student numbers could be the final blow for some institutionsThe immediate problem for universities is the prospect of a collapse in international student recruitment. Along with the loss of income from accommodation rentals and summer conferences, the resulting financial black hole is estimated to be at least £2.5bn. Tens of thousands of jobs are at risk as applicants consider whether attending university this autumn – when it’s likely social distancing will still be in place – is their best option.It is clear, moreover, that the government is unlikely to intervene if things go wrong. In November 2018 the head of the Office for Students, Michael Barber, warned that “failing institutions” could not expect a bailout. The Augar review of higher education, which reported in May 2019, got limited attention amid the preoccupation with Brexit, and its headline proposal for a cut in tuition fees from £9,250 to £7,500 a year was said to have been “quietly shelved” a few months later.The broader proposals, however, are still well worth a look. Augar was concerned about the amount of money universities were spending on marketing: up to £500 per student. Marketing spend and investment in attractive campuses that appeal to open day visitors are predictable consequences of a highly competitive market, but they take vital cash away from education.Also prominent in the Augar review was a plan to clamp down on courses perceived to offer poor employment prospects and long-term earnings (with a note that nursing and teaching should be exceptions). But this failed to take account of the structural problems in access to high-earning jobs. It’s well documented that working-class students face particular barriers to entry to the arts sector, for example. Even if a performing arts student never makes a full-time career of it, he might well make a big contribution to society by running a theatre group in his spare time, something that employment and earnings measure simply don’t capture. Access to arts and culture online has kept many of us going through the lockdown. Let’s not write these subjects off as low value.There is a good case for maintaining a strong university sector. The demographic dip in the number of 18-year-olds that has exacerbated admissions problems for the past few years is about to end. More young people typically go to university during recessions. But without further support, their prospects are grim.Redundancies now mean there will be fewer experienced staff to teach and support students in future. There is a real risk that between the mergers of institutions in financial trouble (a likely prospect following the precedent of the further education sector) and the attacks on “low value” courses, student choice will suffer. That choice should not be just about who gets into the “prestigious” institutions, but about offering people across the country a good selection of local courses that suit their lives and learning style. Higher education is a public good: it would be a deep shame to approach this crisis with a focus on its price, rather than understanding its value.• Catherine Fletcher is professor of history at Manchester politan University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32131a93ca0824a2c66a6a25e8b65f149dcbf337/0_178_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c0dd6913fd94c6da7bc272d7558b186","title":"ve day heroes patriotic multicultural britain","story":"We don’t need to look back to feel patriotic: citizens of modern, multicultural Britain are making sacrifices in front of our eyesLast year it was announced that the traditional first bank holiday of May 2020 – the starting gun of Day Off season – would be moved from the Monday to the Friday, so that it might play a bigger part in the Brexit-related culture war. It would coincide with VE Day. Maybe Spitfires would roar. There would certainly be bunting.With a lack of foresight that has come to define them, the government didn’t tell stationery manufacturers in time – the consequent misprinted calendars and diaries could become collectors’ items, mementos of the kakistocracy, although with an estimated 30m of them, it is unlikely they’d ever be worth very much.Overtaken by recent events, VE-cheerleaders have tried to spruce the commemorations with topical, socially distanced detail: a schedule of activities has spread across social media: 11am, two-minute silence on your doorstep 3pm, watch Churchill on the BBC 4pm tea and scones 9pm, nationwide singalong to We’ll Meet Again.Others object to the shonky history of celebrating VE Day at all, the papering over of war’s brutal realities. What I find nauseating is this whole package of Britishness, the Vera Lynndouble-decker busphonebox imagery that is both exceptionalist (we make the best patriotic singalongs, the most internationally recognisable obsolete technology) and regressive. It invites us, always, to hark back to some indistinct point in the past when we were made of better stuff.Captain Tom Moore is the human shield of this way of thinking, since how could anyone object to him personally? He’s such a stand-up guy. Yet this nostalgia was politically sly at the best of times – it attempts to leverage past glories to build a hierarchy of belonging in the present, a hierarchy that was always somewhat, if not entirely, based on race.Now, in the middle of this crisis, that vision of the past is acutely unhelpful. If we are coming together as a nation – which I think we are – we’re coming together as the country we are right now. It is the country of Moore, and it is also the country of Areema Nasreen, of Habib Zaidi, of Laura Tanner, of the scores of NHS staff who have died saving others, of the millions risking infection to man the frontline of the battle happening today.We don’t have to live on the borrowed symbolism of some imagined time when things were “simpler” (read, more monocultural). We have our own contemporary acts of heroism to celebrate. To stand for two minutes at 11am, mourning the fallen of yesteryear, without first a token of silent respect to the DHL guy, the binmen and the bus drivers, would be not so much insulting as ridiculous.Patriotism, when it has any nobility at all, isn’t just nationalism in its Sunday best. It is a celebration of people willing to make sacrifices for their fellow citizens. Today, those acts of sacrifice are everywhere you look. The country worth celebrating is the one we’re in now, with the people in it now, with the cultural and racial mix it is now. There was no time in the past when we were more British, more altruistic, more ourselves. All debate about who does and doesn’t belong here, who’s in and who’s out, has been capsized.The Farage tendency would probably prefer to drop the concept of patriotism altogether than to see it transmogrify into this. But on the left, too, there is a deep suspicion of any sort of patriotism, as an idea too freighted with delusion, pomposity and violence to have any value – which debate was reignited last weekend, when Starmer said we should be “proud of being patriotic”.If we zoom in on this argument, it comes down to compatriotism. We can feel sympathy toward those beyond our own borders, but we have a direct ability to act on these feelings for our fellow citizens through our territorially defined democracies. If something’s going wrong, if poor decisions are being made and doubled down on, if there’s no transparency, we all bear responsibility for that. Compatriotism turns us from bystanders to allies, from passive observers to active citizens able to demand change. Solidarity can manifest into real change.We can worry about a doctor overseas without PPE, but here in the UK we can act on the lack of equipment for our NHS staff. Going on Twitter to complain about PPE isn’t sufficient signing petitions might help but isn’t a recognised pillar of democracy. But these actions are part of a larger process, they shape our collective sympathies and later, when election day comes, we’ll test our politicians against these beliefs. Did they treat the rest of us as compatriots?I can see that there are progressives who would never accept this, who would be much more comfortable fighting for ventilators in a far- flung country than PPE in Middlesbrough. These agendas don’t have to obliterate each other to survive, but they do have to find some mutual respect. To write off all patriotism as nationalism, as exceptionalism, as a colonial hangover, is as nostalgic in its own way as fixating on Vera Lynn.So let’s have our VE day, even while the concept of any bank holiday is slightly tragic, like celebrating Christmas in a trench. I can take or leave the scones, and the Churchillifying. I cannot ignore the merits of this place, reflected in what its people will to do keep it afloat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9369bc0118474202fb54f4dc78599ce785d82acb/0_114_1896_1138/master/1896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48f21270463d5850e857a6584be46d0c","title":"explain it to me quickly did elon musk and grimes really name their baby x a 12","story":"Is it a troll, a code or an actual name? And how do you pronounce it? One  staffer asked another to explain the decision ... quicklyWhat is “X Æ A-12”, and why is it trending on Twitter?That, my friend, is the name of tech billionaire Elon Musk and musician Grimes’ first child together. At least according to Elon Musk, who tweeted “X Æ A-12 Musk” when one of his 33.7 million followers demanded to know his newborn baby’s name.Is this … real? Or is he trolling?Probably both, in a sense. Most people are working under the assumption that Musk’s tweet is a code for the baby’s real name. The fact Grimes’ has a track on her latest album, Miss Anthropocene, named ‘4 Æ M’ as in “for Æ Musk”, lends weight to the theory.Then Grimes stepped in to clear things up with a brand new cypher that explained Æ stands for AI and X stands for ‘X’.Glad we’re all on the same page then. But seriously, what does it say on the birth certificate?There are several working theories on how to pronounce ‘X Æ A-12 Musk’ and what it might mean at the moment.Why are people so fascinated with this couple?The pair both had pretty obsessive fan communities going into the relationship – many of whom (mostly Grimes fans) had mixed feelings about them as a couple. Since then there’s been a constant stream of drama about them, including a run in with ubiquitous beefer Azealia Banks, a lot of complaints about their mismatched politics (she’s been a Bernie supporter since 2016 he thinks we should “FREE AMERICA NOW”) and, of course, the baby build up.Grimes announced she was pregnant on Instagram by posting a photoshopped image of herself with a translucent, Space Odyssey-esque fetus inside her, and at the time no one was sure if it was a record teaser or an actual declaration that she was with child.Later she confirmed the news with a more confessional, conventional post, so I’d say that, much like a new Tesla model release or a album drop this is a phased marketing campaign for the miracle of life.But then again, he once got into a Twitter feud with a hero navy er, so heated it ended up in court and her entire pop persona is built around weirdness, so who knows what it really says on the birth certificate.Where does this sit on the mad celebrity baby name spectrum?If it’s not a code and the kid really is named X Æ A-12, I’m going to go ahead and award the name five out of five Moon Units. It’s definitely weirder than Blue Ivy (who also has her name worked into plenty of her mum’s creative output) Apple and Moses Shiloh and Pax, or even Nicholas Cage’s kid Kal-El. But, more likely, it’s a code for Xai Archangel – something a bit more normal sounding than, say, Kulture Kiari Cephus or Raddix Madden. Perhaps in an alternate timeline they would have gone with Pilot Inspektor, but sadly, it’s already taken.Whatever next? How does the next famous baby go further? Are we looking at the child of Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid being called a series of emojis?Honestly, I think weird celebrity baby names are becoming passe. With all the Daeneryses Marvels and Teslas running around (seriously, 141 babies were named for Musk’s automotive brand in 2017) – calling your kid Kyd, just doesn’t seem that provocative anymore.

We talk to the women spearheading this new wave‘I wanted it to be relatable to any woman who’s ever worked in an office,” says Kitty Green of her new film The Assistant. “Everything in the film has been in the press already. But I wanted to take viewers on an emotional journey, so they could empathise with the character.”The #MeToo saga has been examined to near exhaustion, but The Assistant manages to add something new. Rather than perpetrators or victims, it focuses on a relative bystander: a young office worker at a New York film production company. We follow this character, played by Julia Garner, through her demeaning routine: commuting in before daybreak, photocopying, printing, taking her male co-workers’ lunch orders, clearing up leftover pizza from the meeting room (as the men come in for the next meeting, she is humiliatingly caught with a crust in her mouth).All this is interspersed with moments of everyday sexism and bullying communications from the Weinstein-like boss next door, who is not named or depicted. The Assistant doesn’t amp up the drama or trowel on the message: instead, it shines a cold, clear light on a culture of complicity, silence and misogyny, not to mention the general dehumanising nature of office life.Green’s previous films were documentaries, often centred on women, often stylistically adventurous. But for The Assistant, she opts for an unfussy approach. “In fiction film-making,” she says, “you can use the closeup to amplify micro-aggressions, tiny moments that often get overlooked.” Green still researched her story like a documentary, though, interviewing hundreds of working women worldwide. “The more real you make it, the more people are forced to interrogate their own role in all this.”As well as its relevance to the #MeToo moment, The Assistant is a type of film we’ve been seeing a lot in US cinema lately: one concerned with everyday experience, particularly of those on the lower rungs if not the margins – yet reflective of modern America as a whole. Authentic settings and scenarios are prioritised over exaggerated dramatics or showy technique (if you want an example of the latter in terms of #MeToo, go see Bombshell).Strikingly, many of these films are being made by andor about women. We’ve had the likes of Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace, about a disturbed survivalist father and his teenage daughter living in the woods Sean Baker’s The Florida Project, which follows a single mother living hand to mouth in an Orlando motel Chloé Zhao’s The Rider, about a Dakota rodeo star suffering ahead injury. And then there was Andrea Arnold’s American Honey, in which a teen runaway falls in with a hedonistic bunch and Andrew Bujalski’s Support the Girls, about female workers banding together at an exploitative sports bar.In Europe, such films would be readily classified as “realism”, in the vein of the neorealist cinema of 1950s Italy or the “social realism” of Ken Loach and Mike Leigh in the UK. But in the US, the idea of realism has never quite taken root. In commercial Hollywood especially, sociopolitical issues must always be refracted through the prism of genre: horror and sci-fi are the popular choices. Escapist cinema will always have its appeal. But perhaps, given America’s current – and worsening – predicament, audiences are now starting to crave films that strive to make sense of the here and now, rather than distract from it.A further sign comes in the form of Eliza Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, about to have a streaming release in the UK. It concerns a Pennsylvanian teenager who travels to New York with her cousin to get a termination. As with The Assistant, the drama is low-key, almost documentary-like. There is no speechifying and no sentimentality: the characters don’t learn a redeeming lesson, offer a political insight or bond in a heartwarming way. Instead, we’re faced with the bare, brutal reality of the situation, which is compounded by the fact that these young women have no money, nowhere to stay, and little experience of the world.In 2007, the drama 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, told a similar story about a woman seeking an illegal termination in Ceauşescu’s Romania. Modern-day America looks just as grim in Never Rarely Sometimes Always, which won an award at Sundance this year in the category of neorealism. Tellingly, this was a new category at the festival.Could the prevalence of female film-makers have something to do with this wave? Opportunities have improved in recent years, it could be said, resulting in fresh perspectives on both the plight of women and the fragilities of male identity in modern America. It would be wrong, however, to assume that female film-makers naturally lean towards more personal, real-life subjects. A more likely factor, suggests Green, is the industry’s lingering apprehension over women.“They’ll fund us,” she says, “when it’s an area they think we have authority on. If I came to them with a dystopian sci-fi movie, they might not believe I could pull it off. But if I say it’s about a 25-year-old assistant, they might think: ‘Oh, OK, that’s something she might know something about.’”Hardship and poverty often go hand in hand with realism, and not just in front of the camera. One reason Italian neorealism caught on worldwide was because it was cheap to make. Perhaps this is why it never really took root in the US. “The idea of a socially conscious, class-conscious cinema has always been deeply suspect in America,” says Paul Malcolm, film programmer at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.Perhaps, he adds, the US establishment was reluctant to admit to a foreign influence, especially when its focus on societal ills and the plight of the working class came with connotations of socialism and communism. A very slender realist thread does run through US film history, however, says Malcolm, who recently co-curated a film season entitled American Neorealism, Part One (1948 to 1984). This showcased the likes of John Cassavetes’ Shadows (a rough, jazzy race drama shot on the streets of 1950s New York), Jerry Schatzberg’s The Panic in Needle Park (with the young Al Pacino as a 1970s junkie) and Barbara Loden’s Wanda (in which she plays a runaway wife drifting through grimy 1970s Pennsylvania).To these we should add landmark African-American films such as Shirley Clarke’s The Cool World and Charles Burnett’s Killer of Sheep. The neorealist strand also runs through black and minority film-making, from Boyz N the Hood to Fruitvale Station. Part two of UCLA’s film season is on hiatus due to the pandemic, but the list of potential candidates is getting longer by the month.Ironically, economic adversity could actually be a factor in the scarcity of US realism. It often becomes a calling card. Film-makers who have paid their dues and garnered critical acclaim through realist dramas are often tempted to bigger (but not always better) things. It happened to such great Italian neorealists as Vittoria de Sica, Luchino Visconti and Roberto Rossellini.It is also happening to their current US successors. Kelly Reichardt successfully transposed her realist sensibility to such period pieces as Meek’s Cutoff. Her latest, First Cow, may be set in the 1820s, but is no less a tale of graft and survival. On the other hand, Chloé Zhao is currently working on the Marvel movie Eternals, which is unlikely to ever be confused with The Rider. Still, while it marks a defection from the realist camp, the move also signals a big-budget vote of confidence in a rising film-maker. Kitty Green has plans but is not willing to discuss them just yet.Realism always seems to be born out of crisis. In Italy, it grew from the ruins of the second world war. Before that, a realist movement in art developed in the US and elsewhere in the 1930s, in the wake of the Great Depression. In fact, one of the most enduring fruits of social realism in the US was the Farm Security Administration, set up as part of Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal in the mid-30s. Its remit was to document the impact of the Depression on rural communities, through photography as well as film. But its images went beyond the merely factual, often achieving the emotional impact of a drama.The prime example is Dorothea Lange’s famous Migrant Mother photograph, which the Library of Congress captioned: “Destitute pea pickers in California. Mother of seven children. Age 32. Nipomo, California.” The photograph has come to encapsulate the whole era not just because it captures what happened but because – given the worry etched across the woman’s face as she holds her young – it also shows how those times felt.To future historians, such films as The Assistant or Never Rarely Sometimes Always could be this image’s 21st-century equivalents. With a new depression looming, there could be more like it to come. If realism is what a crisis calls for, the conditions could hardly be better, which is to say worse.• The Assistant is out now on digital platforms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cf1b555969f8ad12031b721dcde0c176e2071bb/0_435_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b268336de8785106542d355c3ec157e6","title":"uk cinemas lobbying government for june reopening","story":"The UK Cinema Association aims to resume business before July release of Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster Tenet, as studios and distributors scramble to protect theatrical business model The UK cinema industry is understood to be lobbying the government to approve a proposed reopening scheme that would see venues welcome customers by the end of June.Phil Clapp, the chief executive of the UK Cinema Association said: “We’ve made representations to government on the safeguards which UK cinemas would look to have in place for audiences and staff alike upon re-opening, and have asked that consideration be given – with these in mind – to allow cinemas to open by the end of June.”Clapp’s plan is in line with the optimism of Vue Cinemas’ chief executive Tim Richards, who yesterday told the BBC he was hopeful that his chain would be up and running before the 17 July release of Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, one of the remaining tentpole blockbusters whose release has not been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.“What we are trying to do is work with the government to demonstrate that we are not like sporting fixtures or music concerts,” said Richards.“We can actually control how many people go into our cinema at any given time. We have the ability to schedule our films separately and we have the ability to control entrances and exits for customers.”Clapp remains cagey on the nature of proposed safety measures , but it is anticipated that seating capacity caps will be compulsory, as well as staggered screening times, contactless ticketing transactions and enhanced hygiene measures, such as more frequent venue-cleaning and widespread sanitisation stations.Yesterday, Kristian Connelly, the CEO of Australian chain Cinema Nova,\u0026nbspconfirmed they too were banking on Tenet galvanising business once cinemas reopening, calling the film “a totem guiding the industry towards its reboot.”A high-concept sci-fi thriller starring Robert Pattinson and John David Washington, Tenet follows a secret agent who travels through time in an attempt to prevent the third world war. The film, which has a budget of over $200m, was expressly designed for the big screen and shot in Imax, 35mm and 70mm.Nolan has long been a champion of the theatrical experience and sources suggest the film-maker himself may be behind the risky move to make Tenet a canary down the mine in the new cinema landscape.The CEO of Imax, Richard Gelfond, told Variety, “Chris really would like to be coming out with a film that opens in theatres. I don’t know anyone in America who is pushing harder to get the theatres reopened and to get his movie released than Chris Nolan.”If the studio succeeds in turning a profit from the strategy, it will need public confidence to be high enough for them to venture out, and competitors to remain sufficiently nervous that Tenet is the sole major title playing in most cinemas – which will be operating at far short of full capacity – for many weeks.At the present time, only Disney have another major title on the books for July: the long-delayed live-action remake of Mulan, scheduled for release a week after Tenet.Last week, plans were unveiled for cinemas in the Czech Republic and Norway to reopen later in May. Cinemas in China remain closed after a small-scale reopening in mid-March was abruptly halted by the government on 27 March, amid fears of a second wave of infections.All UK cinemas closed in the week before the official lockdown on 23 March. Since then, distributors, exhibitors and studios have been rapidly recalibrating release strategies as the duration of lockdown – and subsequent public concerns over going out – extended.Most major releases were moved back to later this year or to 2021, but those which chose to retain their original date and instead launch digitally have been capitalisingon a captive audience hungry for new entertainment.Universal’s family musical Trolls: World Tour took over $100m (£80m) in its first three weeks of release on platforms such as Amazon Prime, easily breaking records for digital release and prompting Universal’s parent company to suggest that it would seek to collapse the release window once cinemas reopen.“As soon as theatres reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats,” said Jeff Shell, the chief executive of NBCUniversal. His comments were badly received by the world’s two biggest cinema operators – Cineworld and AMC, which owns the Odeon chain in the UK as well as the US’s largest chain of multiplexes – who issued a global ban on forthcoming Universal films, which include the Fast and Furious and Jurassic World franchises.Commentators expressed scepticism about whether the chains would stick to their word, but the reaction revealed the extreme anxiety in the sector about the destruction of a business model already under serious threat from streamers such as Netflix.Universal is also the UK distributor of new James Bond film No Time to Die, which was the first big release pushed back, from April to November. It is thought to be unlikely a simultaneous online release for such a title would be pursued, as the profit margins for such a release – as well as its substantial sponsorship campaigns – would require the maximum possible theatrical footfall.Some sources suggest that Universal may consider a fresh postponement of the release to next year, further suggesting the studio remains committed to cinema releasing.That film’s current release date in the US falls over the Thanksgiving weekend, a traditionally lucrative spot in the calendar, which other studios will be eyeing should No Time to Die move. Earlier this week, Paramount Pictures announced a Christmas release for Top Gun: Maverick, which sees a belated return for Tom Cruise’s flying ace.The studio also announced an early September spot for A Quiet Place 2, which was pulled from the schedules just before its mid-March debut. This echoes the eagerness of exhibitors for an early end to cinema closures, while also allowing for the option of a digitally led campaign.The film, which stars Emily Blunt as the head of a family self-isolating to try and protect themselves against a global threat, would likely follow in the footsteps of Bird Box, Netflix’s similarly themed hit starring Sandra Bullock, which was seen by 45m accounts in its first seven days of release in late 2018.A Quiet Place 2 – which relies on long periods of near silence punctuated by abrupt and loud moments of shock – is also a film ideally suited to the drive-in, which has seen a dramatic upturn in popularity since the start of the pandemic.While studios have been relatively swift to announce plans for tentpole titles, release strategies for smaller-scale dramas – thrown off course by both the closure of cinemas and uncertainty over the future of the film festivals where many of them would have begun their journey – mostly remain murky.The Cannes and Venice film festivals have still to officially declare whether this year’s editions will be cancelled that news will likely determine the fates of films vying for next year’s awards.Yet the announcement last week by the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences that the 2021 Oscars would, for one year only, extend its eligibility criteria to films that had not debuted in cinemas is likely to serve as a considerable reassurance to companies sitting on prestige cinema.It may also be an incentive: if some studios still choose to hold titles back in the hope of maximum theatrical profit, smaller outfits could reap the benefits both in terms of digital revenue and awards acclaim."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61ae7c2bfc22122bde3f0cb7a3f42b8b0fad989f/721_965_8091_4855/master/8091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=704facfad54c893dbbbcf290c2ce8d71","title":"how to cook borscht recipe felicity cloake masterclass","story":"The east European favourite is a great soup to have in your repertoireDespite being best known by its Russian name, borscht, this richly flavoured beetroot soup is beloved throughout eastern Europe, where it has as many variations as names some beefy, some vegetarian (especially for the Lenten fast), some thick with bread or soured cream. One thing they all have in common, however, is a glorious pink colour just the thing to cheer you up in these uncertain times.300g beetroot (see step 1)1 small onion1 small carrot1 stick celery1 small leek50g butter2 whole allspice berries½ bay leaf1.5 litres gelatinous beef stock (see step 4), or chicken or vegetable stock2 medium potatoes, preferably waxy (eg, charlotte or maris peer)½ small cabbage, shredded4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 tbsp cider vinegar1 tsp sugar½ tsp ground black pepperSalt|Soured cream and fresh dill, to serve (preferably Polish soured cream, which has a richer flavour)Borscht is best made with raw beetroot, but if you have only the ready-cooked sort, you can use that instead, though it doesn’t give the finished soup such a vibrant hue or intense flavour. Whichever you use, you’ll need either gloves, or a stout nailbrush, and an apron, because beetroot stains everything it touches.Peel the onion and carrot, and wash the celery and leek thoroughly. Thinly slice the onion. If using raw beetroot, peel it and cut roughly three-quarters of it into small dice, setting the remainder aside for now if using cooked, dice and set aside for now. Cut the carrot and celery into smallish dice and thinly slice the leek.Melt the butter in a large pan over a medium-low heat, then fry the onion until fairly soft and translucent. Add the carrot, leek, celery, raw diced beetroot (if using), allspice berries and bay leaf, and stir to coat in the melted butter. Cook for 10 minutes, adding a little stock if the vegetables begin to look dry.On the subject of stock, borscht is most commonly made with beef stock, preferably the good, gelatinous sort, which will give the soup real richness and body. However, if you don’t eat beef, chicken or vegetable stocks will also be delicious if using the latter, I’d recommend soaking some dried mushrooms in it first to give it more flavour.Meanwhile, wash and peel the potatoes and cut them into small dice. Add them and all the stock to the pan, bring the whole lot to a merry simmer, then turn the heat down to medium low and leave the soup to bubble away gently for 15 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.Wash and finely shred the cabbage (you can use any sort you like, or indeed kale or similar I like to use a white cabbage for its satisfyingly robust texture), peel and crush the garlic, and coarsely grate the remaining raw beetroot, if using. Stir all these vegetables into the pan and cook until everything is tender, particularly the potatoes, which should take about another 10 minutes.Once the vegetables are done, add the diced cooked beetroot, if you’ve gone down that route, just to warm through, then taste and season with the vinegar (cider is preferable, but just about anything will do, or you could use lemon juice if you prefer), sugar, pepper and a good pinch of salt, and taste again: if you think it needs any more of the above, add them gradually until you’re happy with the flavour. And if you prefer a smoother soup, blend it at this stage, too.Divide the soup between bowls and serve with a dollop of soured cream and a sprig of dill, with some dark bread on the side for dunking. Note that, if the weather permits, you can also serve borscht cold it’s nicer well chilled than just left to cool. Sometimes the soured cream (or thick yoghurt) is stirred in rather than served on top.To make this into a more substantial meal, you can add more substantial garnishes such as chopped hard-boiled eggs, spring onions, radishes, cucumber, all of which work particularly well with cold borscht for hot versions, go for hunks of sausage, cured pork or shredded meat such as chicken or slow-cooked beef. Vegetarians may be interested to know that cooked white or broad beans are fairly common additions, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4c17a32a46691206373d4f04ad94b1327d64b5b/11_267_3861_2318/master/3861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e396b49e2b6a4988796bb00ecfdb5586","title":"one box eggs 17 delicious ways to use them french toast huevos rancheros","story":"If you’re tired of boiling or frying, there are plenty of other brilliant ways to use one of the world’s most versatile, affordable, tasty ingredientsIt is a time of scarcity, but also of glut a time when you might buy 18 eggs at the supermarket, just because the last time you tried, they didn’t have any. This could present an opportunity for creativity, but 18 eggs is enough to induce a failure of imagination in anyone: you boil them, fry them, poach them – then what?Here are 17 delicious and slightly further-afield recipes to use up your eggs, most of them employing simple ingredients you may already have.I get way too much credit for making my own mayonnaise – it just isn’t very hard. Everyone should make their own mayonnaise. All that’s required is some egg yolks, oil, salt, mustard, vinegar or lemon juice and about 10 minutes of your time. If you’ve never done it before, Felicity Cloake’s perfect mayo is the place to start.Use a heavy bowl placed on a tea towel – when you’re whisking with one hand while pouring oil with the other, you don’t want the bowl skidding around the worktop. The trick is to start slowly – add only a few drops of oil at time and gradually increase. I find mayo pretty forgiving – an accidental slosh of oil at the start can usually be accommodated – although I must admit that one out of every 20 times I do it, things go completely wrong for reasons I can’t fathom. I still think that’s an acceptable failure rate for almost anything except routine surgery.Call it what you want, but as an American, I find it hard to say the words “eggy bread” without pulling a face. Having said that, the recipe is more or less the same. Beat some eggs with milk, dip in slices of slightly stale bread (almost any kind will do, from crappy supermarket white to brioche), fry on both sides in butter until light browned and … voilà is possibly not the right word to use here. Everything appealing about french toast lies in the presentation. Americans heap on sweet things – maple syrup, fresh fruit, jam, icing sugar – so the result is halfway between breakfast and dessert. Liam Charles opts for an additional coconut coating. Thomasina Miers offers a version with salted caramel pumpkin puree (and tequila).This is more an artefact than a meal, a forgotten fossil of the American diner experience. The monte cristo is basically a ham and cheese sandwich (the cheese is usually swiss – emmental, say) that has been dipped, in its entirety, in some beaten egg and then fried as a solid mass. The result is, shall we say, pretty dense – french toast gone insane. Perversely, a monte cristo is also sometimes dusted with icing sugar. It’s the sort of no-nonsense, down-home cooking that killed Elvis. A recipe is probably unnecessary, but I include one here just so you know I’m not making this up.Eggs feature in lots of different soups, but few are as pleasingly rudimentary as Chinese egg drop soup. Most versions, like this one from the Omnivores cookbook, promise an overall preparation time of under 15 minutes. It’s just chicken stock, thickened with a little cornstarch and flavoured with ginger, sesame oil and spring onions, into which beaten eggs are dropped so they form ribbons. Honestly, I’m making it sound harder than it is. Rachel Roddy’s recipe for the Italian equivalent, stracciatella alla romana is just as basic, employing semolina, parsley and lemon zest instead.This Spanish breakfast – a sort of ratatouille with eggs – is one of a number of regional variations on a simple premise: Yotam Ottolenghi’s North African shakshuka uses a mix of red and yellow peppers Turkish menemen is much the same Diane Kochilas’s Greek version contains fennel and feta and Barrafina’s take uses duck eggs, if perchance you’re hoarding those.I tend to make this when using up odds and ends, so I work with what I’ve got (a wrinkly pepper, an aubergine and half a bag of spinach, say). Sweat some onions in a frying pan or casserole with cumin, a bit of garlic, chilli and paprika. Add the other veg and when everything is softened, chuck in a tin of tomatoes. Simmer until a dent pressed into the mush with a ladle holds its shape long enough for you to crack an egg into it, then do that three more times. Cover and cook until the eggs are how you like them. Serve with good bread.As James Hart, from the restaurant chain El Pastor, says, this really is just three ingredients: salsa, tortillas and fried eggs. It’s perfect for those mornings when a beer with breakfast seems advisable, although Hart’s salsa of peppers, onions and chipotle might require either a clear head or a certain amount of foresight. Seb Emina’s version is simpler and bears a passing resemblance to the pisto to which it is no doubt distantly related.This is a bit of a restaurant breakfast – when you type it into Google, the first thing that comes up is not “eggs benedict recipe” but “eggs benedict near me”. It was invented, allegedly, at the Waldorf in New York, in response to the demands of the hungover socialite for whom it is named.What generally stops people making eggs benedict at home is the hollandaise sauce, which is fiddly and prone to splitting and curdling. But without it, we’re just talking about poached eggs on toasted muffins. If you’ve got an excess of eggs and the time to practice, now might be your moment to conquer hollandaise. Felicity Cloake’s optimised recipe will give you a decent chance of getting right it first time, and once you’ve mastered it you can deploy it as a luxurious accompaniment to asparagus, which is very big right now.They have a certain symmetry: the separated eggs come back together when the meringue is folded in, so you don’t have to figure out what to do with a big bowl of leftover egg whites. Rowley Leigh’s gruyere and parmesan soufflés are made from simple ingredients – flour, butter, double cream, cloves, lemon juice, nutmeg, salt and pepper – and he even allows cheddar as a stand-in if you haven’t got both cheeses. If you’re after something sweeter, you might try a chocolate version.When this lemon tart appeared in the first River Cafe cookbook, it fascinated the amateur: it looked easy, if highly improbable. There is still something highly daunting about a recipe requiring six whole eggs and nine additional yolks. And you don’t roll the sweet pastry you grate it directly into the tart tin, press it down and blind bake it. For the filling, you whisk the eggs with the juice and zest of seven lemons and 350g of sugar over a very low heat, adding 300g of unsalted butter in two instalments – half at the start, half as the mixture thickens. After that, the assembled tart needs 5-8 minutes in a hot oven to colour the top. You can watch a very old video of Ruth Rogers of the River Cafe demonstrating the recipe for Martha Stewart here. Rogers might look as if she’s trying to signal that she’s being held hostage, but it’s still a handy guide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e316a910f7c0c6b55b594f0db5f08692ed78465c/0_239_2915_1750/master/2915.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=eb87bd46b6c4bbd4e4bcb40c0cc35545","title":"my favourite game panini pest zoltan peter comes unstuck against ussr","story":"Before the 1986 World Cup my brother and I had nearly 100 stickers of the Hungarian and we wanted him to lose, badlyBefore the internet ruined the World Cup there was wonder in ignorance. You could look forward to discovering great players and teams about whom you knew next to nothing. In 1986 my brother and I hoped the tournament would be all about some Hungarian called Zoltan Peter. Our reason was bad.All we knew about Peterwas his name and his face because he seemed to be in every pack of Panini stickers we bought. Every time we removed that shiny wrapper there he was, seemingly mocking us with his Lego-man hairdo and the haunting expression of someone who knew there is no problem so grim it cannot be made worse.When the tournament kicked off we had nearly 100 Peterstickers. He was unswappable. My brother started sticking them all over the place. Our home came to resemble the capital city of a totalitarian state, with pictures of the feared ruler wherever you turned.The hope was Peter would reveal himself to be a genius in Mexico, the breakout star of the tournament, a player whose stickers would suddenly be in hot demand, making us akin to lucky imbeciles who accidentally bought shares in an oil company just before it struck black gold.Some pundits made Hungary dark horses for success. They had qualified instead of the Netherlands and they would be highly motivated for their first match – against the USSR 30 years after the bloody suppression of the 1956 Hungarian revolution.We thought we knew a little about the Soviets, since the first Republic of Ireland match we attended was against them in the first qualifier for the finals. A glorious goal by Mickey Walsh yielded a win that took Ireland nowhere. USSR advanced by winning all their home games but none of their away ones. They were so blunt in the run-up to Mexico – scoring once in five friendlies – that they replaced their manager just before the tournament, rehiring Valeriy Lobanovskyi, whom they had previously jilted. Hungary’s for the taking?Peter turned out to be a tall 21-year-old, a left-back on the raw side. When Nikolay Larionov ran down the right for the Soviets in the second minute, Peter hurtled towards him with all the control of a man using roller skates for the first time. Crash. Viktor Chanov dabbed the resultant free-kick towards the near post, Hungary defended pitifully and Pavel Yakovenko slotted the ball into the net. Oh, for Pete’s sake.Then Sergei Aleinikov blasted in a stupendous drive from miles out. Two-nil to the USSR after five minutes. My brother and I now yearned, petty as you like, for total Hungarian humiliation.In sport it can feel wholesome to want your rival to be crushed. Easing off is a betrayal. Back in the Cold War days commentators called teams from behind the Iron Curtain “crack outfits” and “ruthless machines”, their forwards not baby-faced assassins but cold-blooded, robotic ones. It was dehumanising hooey but, on this occasion, we demanded the Soviets be heartless.But wait! In the 21st minute Hungary won a free-kick within shooting range and Peter stepped up to take it. He ran over the ball, the big tease, and Lajos Detari booted it into the stands. Then another woeful Hungarian tackle led to a penalty being lashed home by Igor Belanov, who, like Yakovenko, proved a genuinely thrilling discovery.In the 62nd minute Hungary made their first substitution: off came Peter. Two young clowns on a couch thousands of miles away made obscene hand gestures in his direction. Then we urged the USSR, as if they were our proxies, to enforce more vengeance.With eight players from Dynamo Kyiv they were brilliant, far too nifty for disintegrating opponents. But in the second half the Soviets, all too human, relaxed a tad, saving energy for a deep run in the tournament. They still scored three more times, twice into an empty net after slick moves and once thanks to an own goal by Laszlo Dajka.USSR even missed another penalty. Vadym Yevtushenko blazed it so high the commentator wondered if he had misfired out of sympathy. But some people felt 6-0 was the least Peter and co deserved – and, at the final whistle, those people tore up a pile of unused stickers and staged an Argentina 78-style ticker-tape parade in their front room.Peter did not appear again in the tournament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/124d67d9c9eccd75b08a2ebfae15db5a0e97e7b9/35_133_2178_1307/master/2178.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a1b253ca9d475ac735d43049af4e282","title":"beyond blue review blue planet ii the game","story":"iPadiPhone (PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions forthcoming) E-Line MediaRealistic marine-ing game shines a light on the deep oceanA mellow and overtly educational game about marine wildlife, Beyond Blue is an opportunity to submerge yourself in the expansive beauty of the Western Pacific. Futuristic technology enables our marine scientist to scan creatures, track whale calls and withstand the crushing pressures of the deep ocean as she follows a pod of sperm whales through seascapes taken from the BBC’s Blue Planet II, from shallows to open ocean to the toxic deep-sea bile pool that gave me nightmares for weeks after seeing it on TV.Atmospheric though these watery places are, there’s no peril in this version of deep-sea ing, even when you try to manufacture it. Attempts to swim directly into the gaping mouth of a humpback or provoke a hammerhead shark yield nothing but the odd visual glitch. You can admire the impressively realistic sea life at leisure, panning drones around creatures to record their songs and examine their markings. Nonetheless, do not expect an entirely chill time beneath the waves. Inevitably for a game informed by the actual state of our oceans, there’s a touch of sadness here.In between es, on the small submarine that serves as home, phone calls between our er and her family and colleagues add a superfluous touch of human drama. Beyond Blue layers a few different plot lines over the ocean exploration: a grandmother with Alzheimer’s disease, a fractious sibling relationship, unauthorised mining and sea pollution.None of these is particularly well developed.

Strangely, even though I spent most of my time in Beyond Blue obediently scanning wildlife, the in-game encyclopedia contains few facts about the many different species you encounter.

The saddest sign would be for us to emerge from this pandemic with a handful of billionaires controlling all of our news,” she said.Mainstream Indian media have offered little critical reporting, according to executive editor of the Caravan journal, Vinod Jose, who pointed to a meeting prime minister Narendra Modi reportedly held with more than 20 media chiefs in March.He said the media’s financial and political independence is linked in India because as revenues fall companies may be forced to turn towards tax rebates and government advertising to survive.“Going forward, the challenges for Indian media will only increase, because an authoritarian government who is interested in killing journalism is in power, and a media who doesn’t have the guts to speak truth to power or the financial independence to stay afloat without taking government advertisements constitutes the mainstream press in India,” he said.Many outlets are reliant on print advertising and have suffered major losses as circulation has almost ground to a halt amid lockdowns and curfews around the world.Patel said the cancellation of major advertising campaigns meant the Mail \u0026amp  was suddenly struggling even while its website recorded its best audience numbers.Financial problems would have a severe impact on how journalists work, and some smaller publications may not survive, Patel added.Even before the pandemic, the Reuters Institute for Journalism’s 2019 report into digital media described the future for South Africa’s media as “grim” because of low online revenue and plummeting advertising.Philanthropic organisation Luminate has argued that with print circulations grinding to a halt for many newspapers and their business models destroyed, the pandemic could become a “media extinction event”.As a solution, it has renewed its call for a global fund to help public interest media maintain their independence.The editor of the Dhaka Tribune, Zafar Sobhan, said the crisis should be a wake-up call for Bangladesh’s media, as it accelerates the downfall of print news and potentially puts those who are unable to adapt out of business.“Print circulation was already in freefall. This could be the knockout blow. Monetising online has proved difficult in Bangladesh. Now we have no choice but to get up to speed and figure out online revenue models that will pay,” said Sobhan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a6e85adafdf3ed04fbf341001b047c78e74c95a/0_246_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b1c17cc30ff67af1bf311613f6e0f00","title":"pollution causing birth defects in children of drc cobalt miners study","story":"Researchers link exposure to mining pollutants to greatly increased risk of conditions such as spina bifida and limb abnormalitiesThousands of people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are being exposed to dangerous levels of toxic pollution that is causing birth defects in their children as they mine for cobalt used to make rechargeable batteries for smartphones, laptops and electric cars, a new medical study has found.Research published in the Lancet last week found that local people working in mines in the African “copperbelt”, a mining region stretching across Zambia and the DRC, are at significantly higher risk of having children born with serious birth defects.Researchers from the University of Lubumbashi in the DRC and the universities of Leuven and Ghent in Belgium compared 138 newborn children of families within the copperbelt with 108 children born outside the mining zone in Lubumbashi. It found that the risk of birth defects greatly increased when a parent worked in a copper and cobalt mine.The researchers linked the increased risk to the high levels of toxic pollution caused by the extraction of cobalt in southern Katanga, named one of the 10 most polluted areas in the world.The study was commissioned after academics at the University of Leuven read reports from local doctors, NGOs and local authorities of high numbers of children of miners in the DRC being born with conditions such as limb abnormalities, cleft palates and neural tube defects such as spina bifida.“This is the first study investigating the effects of mining-related pollution on newborns in sub-Saharan Africa and has shown that metal miners are indeed at increased risk of having a child with a birth defect.” said Dr Daan Van Brusselen, a paediatrician at Ghent University who worked on the study alongside doctors in Belgium and the DRC.“Although it’s still not clear how these birth defects arise, every day tens of thousands of workers are exposed to heavy work with a lot of pollutants and dust. The health of the miners and their families must be taken into account by anyone who profits from or uses cheap smartphones around the world,” he said.Pressure is growing on the multinationals who continue to source cobalt from the DRC to address the human rights and environmental abuses that have been uncovered in mines across the countryEarlier this year a lawsuit was launched in the US, which accused the world’s largest technology companies of aiding and abetting in the deaths of children working in mines in the DRC.

I didn’t think twice about it – “You just have a dry scalp,” I told her.The itching, along with the complaining about the itching, intensified. I got her some anti-dandruff shampoo.It didn’t occur to me that her itchy head could be nits. Perhaps if she’d been going to school I might have twigged sooner. There would have been an exasperated little note from her teacher, “Please check your children’s hair, we’ve had another case of head lice … ” followed by confessions and sympathy in the year 4 WhatsApp.Then my head started itching. My 10-year-old daughter Grace’s head started itching too. The penny dropped. I tentatively parted Cerys’ hair and groaned as I saw the eggs.I performed a quick one-woman demonstration of parts one to three of the seven stages of grief. Disbelief (Surely we can’t have nits? We’ve been isolating for five weeks!), denial (SURELY WE CAN’T HAVE NITS? WE’VE BEEN ISOLATING FOR FIVE WEEKS!) and guilt (I’m so sorry that I fobbed you off with anti-dandruff shampoo when you actually needed fast-acting head lice treatment).Eventually I got my act together and made a dash to the chemist. The pharmacist patiently explained that, while the girls have been at home, the nit lifecycle is quite long. In other words, the nits had been isolating with us from the start.I was 16 the last time I had nits. My then 13-year-old stepbrother had picked them up and lovingly shared them with the rest of the family. The smell of the head lice formula left me as dizzy, as did the indignity of being a teenage girl with head lice. I’ve heard that 90s nostalgia is big right now so I suppose getting nits was fairly well timed.Despite having nits in my childhood, I’d never had to deal with them as a parent. My girls had managed to avoid catching them – I credit my anti-nit plait-buns – that’s a hairstyle, not a baked good. Although I’d heard tales of the Nitty Gritty fine-tooth comb, I’d never actually used one. The three of us (the infested ones) huddled together on the sofa and read the instructions.Nits are tricky little buggers. They’re tiny and quick and difficult to see. Even with a liberal coating of head lice treatment (which smells a lot better than it used to), it was apparent that this was going to be a long afternoon. Fortunately, given that it happened in the middle of the lockdown, we didn’t have anywhere else to be.We made the best of it (stage seven – acceptance). I told them stories about the terror of being hauled out of class by the nit nurse. They made a list of all the kids they knew who’d had nits (almost all of them). It was a methodical job so, in a warped way, it was an exercise in mindfulness. While it wasn’t ideal, there was a simple joy in being in it together.When it was my turn my girls worked together, one combing with a reassuring running commentary, and the other squirting the treatment on. It should have been grim, like the memory of the nit nurse, but it was surprisingly relaxing.I never expected a day that started with an itchy head to end like this. My girls took great care in their work and, more than anything, I felt loved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/460de4785dddaa8f27d5249523afc0cb4422592b/0_157_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cb91480ca37bf60358edd5e9357534e","title":"the global race for face masks podcast","story":"The world economy may have dramatically dipped and the price of oil crashed, but one commodity is seeing an unprecedented boom: the face mask.

And these two objects are orbiting each other,” he said. “And the other branch of the mobile you have one star which is much farther away from the other two.”The black hole is unusual. “The hallmark of this black hole is that it is truly black,” he said. “Almost all the other black holes that we know are in the Milky Way – and there are only two dozen of them – shine very brightly in X-rays.”Baade said the other black holes each had a companion star that feeds them with gas. However, this does not appear to be the case for the newly discovered black hole and its nearby star.“This star is not so massive that it loses a lot of gas and therefore the black hole is starving and that makes it so dark.”Baade added that HR 6819 – or rather, its stars – can be seen by the naked eye. “If you want to see it really overhead, you need to be at the southern tip of South America,” he said. The new work, which is published in the journal Astronomy \u0026amp Astrophysics, is based on data collected using telescopes at ESO’s La Silla Observatory in Chile.“Theoretical models suggest that in the Milky Way there are between 100m and 1bn black holes,” said Baade. “We are finding a tip of an iceberg.”The discovery could shed light on an unusual system in the constellation Gemini called LB-1. This system has previously been suggested to be composed of a star and a tremendously massive black hole – a finding that has foxed experts. Baade noted LB-1 appears to be very similar to HR 6819.He said that suggests LB-1 could be a triple system, meaning its “dark object” would be a black hole of a more normal mass, or possibly a neutron star.Dr Ziri Younsi, an expert on black holes at University College London, who was not involved with the research, said: “It’s remarkable that a black hole has been found so close to Earth,” noting for context that the centre of our galaxy is about 25,000 light years from Earth.“This new study hints at the exciting prospect of a whole population of stellar-mass black holes lurking in our Galaxy,” Younsi said. “It also offers a potential new means to detect many more systems comprising such quiescent black holes in our galactic neighbourhood in the near future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30577d370437eb4ca9f6d405a23d7d329bfd4168/0_0_1080_720/master/1080.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40e6a50f191b795df662f08a38de2a62 720w","title":"longer lockdown for over 70s would allow fewer restrictions for rest of uk scientists suggest","story":"Plan involves beefing up protection for vulnerable people while easing controls on othersBritain could exit the coronavirus lockdown by relaxing restrictions on more than half of the population and beefing up protection for those over 70 and vulnerable people, scientists have said.The strategy from researchers at Edinburgh University, known as “segmenting and shielding”, is intended to create leeway for ministers to ease the lockdown on those least at risk from the virus while ensuring that vulnerable people only come into contact with carers and family members who are free from infection.The Edinburgh proposal, which has been submitted to ministers, could see millions of people afforded more freedom to move around and return to work while protecting older people and those with underlying health problems to prevent a surge of new infections from overwhelming the NHS.Ministers are cautious about the idea of extending the lockdown for people over 70 while giving more freedom to younger people because Tory MPs are unhappy with the idea and campaign groups argue that it amounts to discrimination. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “A lot of people over 70 are fit and have kept themselves fit, often more so than people of other ages. There has been a backlash and people don’t think it’s the right way to go about it.”However, it emerged on Tuesday that the government’s scientists in March modelled an extended lockdown of 17 weeks for older people compared with eight to 13 weeks for the rest of society, as part of their advice on how to contain coronavirus.Ministers are understood to have considered the idea of different rules for older people, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, did not rule it out when pressed about the idea on Tuesday. A spokesman for No 10 also said this week it was “perfectly reasonable that we will look at how guidance will apply for different age bands and we’ll continue to be guided by the science”, and stressed that there was a higher risk of coronavirus having a more serious impact for people as they got older.The government is expected to announce on Thursday that the lockdown will have to continue for the time being. Boris Johnson will set out plans for the next phase of tackling the virus on Sunday, including how restrictions could be lifted when it is safe to do so. The first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, has said the next phase should be “more comfortable, more sustainable” for the public.Downing Street confirmed on Tuesday that restrictions on outdoor activities were likely to be lifted first. “There is less likelihood of transmission of disease outdoors than indoors, and that is something we will be considering as part of the review,” the prime minister’s official spokesman said.The Edinburgh proposal could provide a plan for how different age groups or sections of society with different risk profiles could be treated. In a study outlining the strategy, the researchers describe a number of scenarios where the measures come into force over a three-month period.R, or the \u0027effective reproduction number\u0027, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity.\u0026nbsp“The strategy works by concentrating efforts to control Covid-19 in the segment of the population that most needs protecting,” said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University.Woolhouse stressed that the approach was not a magic bullet, adding that it would need to be combined with contact tracing and other measures to allow Britain to ease some of its lockdown restrictions. As scientists learned more about who was most vulnerable to the virus, the number of people who needed shielding could be reduced, he said.Woolhouse, who said he was speaking as an independent scientist, is a member of the UK government’s scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling (Spi-M), which is chaired by Prof Graham Medley, a co-author on the paper. Medley was one of the first scientists to discuss how the population might acquire “herd immunity” as the epidemic swept through the country. The work has been peer-reviewed by the Royal Society’s newly formed Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic (Ramp) group.Sarah Harper, a professor of gerontology at Oxford University, who was not involved in the research, raised concerns about considering all people over 70 as vulnerable, even if that changed over time. “Using chronological age without taking into account iniduals’ health conditions will confine healthy, active, older iniduals to their homes,” she said.“Easing lockdown might be more effective if the risks were explicitly explained to the population, the possible range of vulnerabilities highlighted and iniduals asked to take appropriate action. These are sensible public health approaches which might have a better chance of being complied with,” Harper added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5e7a955f391dd78ef810b287e639e4ed995526/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b46f2f659b0b26302e3dd48a7a03ed5","title":"lego learning and laughter how libraries are thriving in lockdown","story":"UK libraries are at the heart of local communities as eborrowing soars, printers turn out PPE, and staff get creative online“Such a lot of our work is about social interaction. Especially in smaller libraries, we’re sometimes the only ones people see in a week,” says Carol Stump, chief librarian at Kirklees council in West Yorkshire. “We wanted to be sure that with libraries in lockdown, people could still access our services. And we felt they might be glad of a chat.”Stump runs a team of 110 library staff. Many of them have been redeployed during the pandemic, but those still working for the library service are keeping in touch with local people, particularly those over 70. Calls help people feel less isolated, and library staff can check whether they have enough food and medical supplies, or need other support. One 90-year-old man, for example, was missing his regular trip to the library to read the local paper, but is now able to read it online. “It’s gone down so well. People have been so grateful,” says Stump.The sudden switch from a physical space to online has been challenging for staff and users, but has also highlighted the vital role of library services and the skills of staff. From Orkney’s Lego challenge to Truro’s storytime at home sessions, librarians are coming up with innovative ways to stay engaged with users and each other.While many library staff have been redeployed to emergency roles with their councils, such as working on telephone helplines, packing and distributing care packages, and working as registrars, those still in their core roles are seeing demand leap for all kinds of digital services.In Suffolk, a new online advice service has been launched. “It’s easy to forget what we do as public librarians, which is provide information you can trust,” explains Krystal Vittles, head of Suffolk library service delivery. “Some question why we need librarians for this when we have the internet, but even the most internet-savvy people are worried about what to trust, and we are trained for this.” It also enables staff to have a conversation, albeit online, with people as they would in real life. “We can have a bit of a laugh with the customers.”Librarians are using social media to share lighter moments with one another, too, such as a Twitter conversation about interesting bookmarks they’ve found in library books, including an After Eight mint still in its wrapper and a Blockbuster card (“a proper ancient artefact”). Staff and readers are also creating huge amounts of online content, with one rhyme time by a library regular shielding at home reaching more than 2,000 views. Librarian Ian Anstice, editor of Public Libraries News, has written that the pandemic has highlighted the ingenuity and ability of library staff. “Covid-19 has been to library services the equivalent of what the second world war was to arms manufacturing,” he writes. “Suddenly, within a week in lots of cases, librarians have switched to online services. How good that makes library services look to their councils.”Being able to prove the value of services to their communities, and being appreciated by local politicians, is welcome news for many libraries after years of cuts – in the year to March 2018, 127 British libraries closed, with 35 more closures the following year. There has also been investment during the crisis. Arts Council England has announced a £1,000 grant for each of the 151 public library services in England to help them purchase new digital stock.Libraries are finding innovative ways to use resources, including using 3D printers and laser cutters to produce PPE equipment. In Gateshead, where libraries recently became part of the council’s public health service, a small dedicated team began by printing face mask valves for local hospital staff and has now moved on to produce visors for local care homes, using a network of 3D printers in libraries and people’s homes.“The team has now delivered nearly 2,200 visors to more than 50 different local care homes,” says Stephen Walters, Gateshead council’s principal library manager. “The appreciation has been overwhelming. One home applauded the driver as he made deliveries.”Walters says staff have been working flat out. “I felt like a Victorian mill owner,” he says. “They even had to be persuaded to take Sundays off.”As in other areas, some of Gateshead’s library staff have been redeployed. One employee helped a resident get his utilities restored after they had been off for weeks. “Library employees are perfectly suited to this new role,” says Walters. “They are inherently creative and positive, and deal with erse customer needs through their normal work. This is just a greatly enhanced version of what they do day to day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdb549a2f1bf1bf31e89b740b5572b3595894d4e/0_16_2769_1662/master/2769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27a158a9102e3771c9dc50e8b9de63fc","title":"f1 prize money payout liberty media","story":"Formula One’s teams will get their full prize money despite nearly half of its events getting the red light due to the coronavirus pandemic, owner Liberty Media is expected to announce on Thursday.

The island has never gone into total lockdown, though the government has promoted social distancing and face masks. Both the baseball and football seasons got under way in Taiwan last month, but without spectators, providing rare live action for fans at home at a time when the pandemic has shut down most professional sport around the globe.The health minister, Chen Shih-chung, told reporters that 1,000 spectators would be allowed in to baseball matches on Friday in Taipei and the central city of Taichung. “Starting from the eighth, fans will be allowed in for professional baseball games,” said Chen.Taiwan’s baseball league said in a separate statement that it will sell tickets on a “real name” basis with designated seats, meaning authorities can more easily trace people if there are any infections linked back to attending the matches. Fans will be required to undergo temperature checks and wear face masks, and seats will be kept one metre apart, it said.“Wear your mask properly and show our unity and discipline. Let the world see the pride of Taiwan,” the league wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday, adding it will be the world’s first professional baseball league to allow audiences back in.Baseball is wildly popular in Taiwan, thanks to a strong cultural influence from Japan and the United States. To meet global appetite for any sports events at a time when many other countries have been locked down, baseball games in Taiwan have been providing English-language commentary and have attracted rare attention from foreign fans and media.However, it has not all been smooth sailing, and there has been controversy in Taiwan about the name of the baseball league, called the Chinese Professional Baseball League, after several overseas sports commentators confused the island with China.

He told staff: “We don’t know exactly when travel will return. When travel does return, it will look different.”Airbnb has employees in 24 countries. Its headquarters are in San Francisco and its European head office is in Dublin, where it employs about 500 people. Some of the deepest job cuts are likely to be in newer areas of the business such as Airbnb  “Luxe”, which offers what it describes as upmarket homes and dedicated trip designers.“People will want options that are closer to home, safer, and more affordable,” said Chesky.Airbnb said there were signs of of a mild recovery in some locations, adding that was growing evidence of travellers in Europeans booking properties in their own countries this summer rather than abroad.Airbnb joins airlines and travel operators cutting staff numbers during the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, British Airways announced 12,000 staff would be made redundant, and on Tuesday Virgin Atlantic said it would cut 3,000 jobs and mothball its Gatwick operations.The collapse in Airbnb’s revenue has thwarted its plans to float on the stock market this year. The projected $40bn-plus flotation would also have earned many of its staff large payouts, as early entrants into the company were partly remunerated in stock options.This year, Airbnb shored up its finances with $2bn in new loans and funding, which according to reports suggested a valuation of about $18bn, much below earlier expectations.Airbnb started life as AirBed \u0026amp Breakfast in 2008 after Chesky and another co-founder, Joe Gebbia, let out their apartment in San Francisco. The platform has about 150 million users and 7m property listings across the world.In a blogpost detailing the job cuts, Chesky told staff: “I have a deep feeling of love for all of you.” Within hours, those being made redundant received an email invitation for a departure meeting, with US and Canadian tstaff told they would leave by next Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c61ed83b233cdf16fc67c990ee53acb16ceef34/252_145_1361_817/master/1361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=070714f6c17cbbfe8f7415acc20e90f6","title":"microsoft launches faster surface book 3 and surface go 2","story":"Windows-maker updates top and cheapest PCs, plus new noise cancelling headphones Microsoft is launching a revamped line of its most powerful and cheapest Windows 10 PCs, the Surface Book 3 and Surface Go 2, as it adjusts to continue operations during the pandemic.The new products, announced by blog post rather than an event, are Microsoft’s premium computers competing directly with the likes of Apple and Dell, but with more novel designs.Alongside Nvidia GeForce consumer graphics processors, Microsoft has also added the option for Nvidia’s Quadro graphics chips for the first time, which are commonly used in workstations in academia and commercial settings.Surface Book 3 starts at $1,599 in the US and will be available from 21 May.

How can you prepare effectively to make the most of the remote interview process? This handy seven-point guide will help you keep in mind the questions you should be asking any potential new members of your staffroom. The teachers on your candidate shortlist might know their ABCs from their hypotenuses – but what do you need to do to get the best out of them in a remote interview?1. Prepare your questions – and answersAn online interview is like any other – make sure you’ve set your interview agenda. If you’re interviewing with another member of staff make sure you’ve decided who will ask what questions – and also, who will answer any questions from your candidates. Key questions you should be prepared to answer would include: What makes the school unique? What does the school need to improve? Does the school provide personalised, professional development? How would pupils, parents and other teachers describe your school? And be prepared to include a range of pupils and teachers in the recruitment process. Those who do this now should find themselves ahead of the recruitment process.2. Find a quiet space When you’re conducting the interview make sure you’re in a quiet space, with a background that is tidy and clear. It’s also worth considering how you position your microphone and camera lens so that you can present yourself from the waist upwards. Simple stuff I know, but you’d be surprised how many do not consider camera angle and lighting positioning. It could make the difference in a successful appointment!3. Ensure your technology is up to date It’s worth making sure your browser is running the latest updates and that you’ve got a reliable broadband connection. Check both camera and microphone are working with your fellow teachers before you are on an interview video call. It’s worth giving candidates details of the technology you use in advance of your interview, so they have time to familiarise themselves with the differences between Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts or Microsoft Teams.4. Prepare to multitaskLearn how to speak to the camera lens, make notes as well as use the video technology to navigate between your camera, the screen and the microphone. When you are not speaking, for example, you may wish to mute your microphone so that the interviewee does not hear any distracting background noises. If you take time to rehearse, this will also help schools make better appointments today rather than after discovering where and how the technology lets you down.5. Offer to let candidates speak to colleagues Once you have set the interview agenda it can be helpful to arrange for an informal meeting with colleagues already working at the school. Select a range of teachers who best represent your school, to show your potential as a good employer. For example, a member of the support staff, the school receptionist, a member of staff who has just joined the school and a member of staff who is leaving the school. You’re looking to give an indication of the school’s culture. This may be difficult to achieve remotely, but it’s not impossible. Plan to have this in place, now.6. Offer a pupil interview if possibleTechnology may also be able to offer the capacity for a pupil interview experience, or perhaps even an online lesson for the candidates to teach with the panel observing as part of the application process. If you are able to provide the opportunity for candidates to teach a lesson online, it’s critical to offer as much information about the lesson and the children for it to be an effective exercise. Of course, during a pandemic, going about teaching online will be immensely different from teaching face-to-face: watch to see how teachers engage the pupils in a virtual classroom. How do candidates communicate effectively through a camera lens? Can they question, hold to account, and provide feedback to pupils online?7. Can you offer a virtual tour?One of the key opportunities at interview is a tour of the school. Doing this remotely presents a significant challenge, but again, those innovative school leaders will already be working ahead of the bell curve. Beyond the school website, most schools will have a range of images of events taking place on site, with photo galleries and online videos. It’s worth making sure your school’s social media strategy shares positive news stories with the general public, as well as pupils and parents, and prospective teachers. With most schools open during Covid-19 in a limited capacity, there will be an option for school leadership teams who are currently on-site to provide applicants with a virtual tour of the school facilities, classrooms and office spaces. This will allow potential candidates to ask questions or gain a perception of potential employment opportunities.Appointing teachers during a pandemic is difficult, but it’s not impossible. To ensure your school isn’t missing key appointments when all schools resume full service, it is critical that your school considers remote recruitment ideas now.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b64c0f636f3690d5155b3d549d130742b4b3be93/0_118_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d50164f93cb2f968cf2f8c49cea81a27","title":"looking to teach at a new school heres how to find the one thats right for you","story":"How do you get a feel for what a school is really like when you can’t walk through the playground or see what’s on the whiteboards? For teachers in the remote recruiting market, here’s how to make the most of the virtual experienceWhether it’s your first job after teacher training or you’re an experienced hand, evaluating a potential school is a crucial part of the interview process. But how do you do that remotely? Here are top tips for teachers applying to work at a new school under lockdown.Prepare for remote interviewsAlthough the coronavirus pandemic presents us with many challenges, it’s worth remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years. Independent and English language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via video to work with them overseas. The current lockdown has forced all schools across the UK to reconsider how they recruit teachers.Be tech-readyOn both sides of the camera it is critical to check the video technology, the microphone and your background environment when conducting an interview via video. What apps will they be using? Have you used them before? If not, rehearse with a friend.Think the process throughIt is crucial to find a school which best meets your needs. Find as many schools as possible before you begin any application process. This will give you motivation, as well as building up a network for future job opportunities.Visit the school – virtuallyIn order to determine which type of environment you feel most comfortable with, one important planning aspect to consider is your journey to and from the school, should you be successfully appointed. Under normal circumstances it’s worth considering a trial journey during peak commuter hours to see if the journey is manageable. Under the current conditions, it’s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site – just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country, or an international job. A conscientious school leader should be more than happy to take candidates on a video tour. This is even more critical during lockdown when all schools are struggling with recruitment.Prepare your applicationLook at the key facts listed on the job advert, and evaluate how they match up with the person specification – not the job description. Think carefully about what you can offer the school. Initial research on examination performance, pupil demographics and inspection reports will help you identify key priorities in the application. It would also be wise to consider why you want to work at the school. For more on this, see the five-minute interview plan. Regarding referees and references, it is always worth asking permission and giving those key people a “heads-up”. References are frequently requested with limited time for the referee to respond, putting them under pressure. You don’t want to put your job application in jeopardy!Submitting your application Spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck! Whatever you do, do not copy and paste bog-standard educational cliches and fire off application after application without due diligence. I’ve seen thousands of applications thrown in the bin because they accidentally mention another school’s name, have grammatical errors or include inappropriate information (no one needs to know your astrological birth sign!). Ask a friend to proofread your application. Show the reader that you have conducted some research, posing questions and thoughts, as well as some solutions with evidence of things that you have contributed towards in your current role. Remember, you can discuss finer details during the interview, so keep the facts concise.Plan your questions The easiest way to discover if a school leadership team is on track is to ask direct questions at the interview. For example: “How many teachers left your school last year?” “How much of the overall budget does the school protect for professional development?’’ “Why should I work at your school?” “Is the school budget in deficit, if so by how much?” If these questions are avoided, it’s a good indication that this might not be the school for you.Nail that interview!Be prepared, rehearse potential questions and answers, pick out what you will wear on the day – even for an online interview. Show interest and be conscientious by keeping your questions and answers concise. Whatever you do, do not be late: in an online interview, there really are no traffic excuses.Have your answers readyBe prepared to answer a range of challenging questions, and rehearse a variety of scenarios where you can provide concise answers. What would colleagues say about you? What area of the teaching standards do you most need to work on? What has been the greatest challenge in your career to date? Where do you want to be in three years’ time? Why do you want to work in this school? When it comes to “awkward” questions, they can often be a test of how professional and measured you will be in your response, rather than the answer itself.Final questionsFinally, asking questions at the end of an interview, always have two or three questions prepared. Whatever you do, make sure you ask them. It shows the interview panel that you are prepared, interested and it is your one opportunity to put them on the spot and turn the tables in the process.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55f1622a0eb54040ce4ec2c7da77870f2d120e7d/0_276_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=703fa1814e91baa9df95c9651da83d53","title":"the new rules of remote recruiting how to prepare for an online interview","story":"The Covid-19 lockdown has completely reshaped the way companies operate – even once restrictions are eased, many expect remote working to stay. So how can you impress a potential new boss from home?Candidates in their dressing gowns, dogs and children running about, partners in the background watching TV, or piles of dirty washing up on the kitchen counter – with 25 years in the recruitment sector, David Stone has heard it all when it comes to disastrous video interviews. “When people are working at home, because it’s your personal space, a lot of candidates completely overlook the fact that it’s still a formal first meeting,” Stone, the founder of MRL Consulting Group, says. “It’s amazing what you see going on in the background.”Holding interviews remotely – whether by phone or video – isn’t a new concept, particularly for companies that have built remote, international teams. Nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process, with an influx of artificial-intelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years. There are algorithms that can analyse candidates’ tone of voice, facial expressions, and speech patterns during video pre-assessments, scoring them against an ideal profile for that role. Graduates have reportedly spent thousands of pounds learning how to beat these systems.But for many companies, still recruiting during the global Covid-19 lockdown, moving the process online can be a daunting prospect. Stone recommends all involved – recruiter and candidate – treat a remote interview like a traditional, face-to-face meeting as much as possible. “Get up, get showered, put a suit on,” he says. “Pay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you. Make sure you’ve got an hour’s worth of peace and quiet.” Some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person, he adds. “You’ve got to try and get past that. Build rapport, put them at their ease, get them talking about subjects they’re comfortable talking about so they relax.”Ellie Wilson, the co-founder and operations director of Virtalent, has run hundreds of remote interviews since launching her virtual assistant service six years ago. She’s found the recruitment process much more efficient when it’s all online. “We can go from someone submitting an assessment to having the final interview and running background checks almost within 48 hours,” she says. “I certainly don’t think you lose anything just because you can’t shake that person’s hand. I ask the same questions to a candidate that I would if they were sitting right in front of me. For me, nothing changes – I try to extract the information that I need to be assured that this is the right person for the job: can I see this person working with us, working with our clients? Do they give me confidence?”While recruiters may prefer to do the first round of remote interviews over the phone, Wilson says it is important to see the person you’re speaking to at some stage in the process. That doesn’t have to be via a bespoke HR platform – video conference tools such as Zoom, Skype, and Microsoft Teams work just as well. “If they’re going to be working remotely, you also need to be reassured they have the right set-up at home,” she adds. “I check that they have a dedicated desk area, they have an appropriate seat, and it looks free from distraction.”Candidates and interviewers alike should switch on all equipment 15 minutes beforehand, think about getting the lighting and camera angle right, test microphones, and put phones and any push notifications on silent, says flexible working consultant and executive coach Marilyn Devonish. “When speaking, look directly into the camera so the other person feels like you’re looking at them,” she adds, rather than getting distracted by your own image on the screen (Zoom has a “hide myself” option, which can help). She recommends interviewees also do a practice run-through with friends or family: “Think about making sure your personality comes out. So if you’re going for a job that needs a motivated self-starter, that’s what you’ve got to be when you’re on camera.” Candidates interviewed by video also have the luxury of being able to use printouts of the job description and any other reference notes without the interviewer’s knowledge.Recruiters should be mindful of including more visual and linguistic cues than they might use in person to show they’re following what the candidate is saying. “Things like saying ‘right’, ‘OK’, ‘great’,” Devonish adds. “If the sound drops, this is not the time to be scared or too polite – say: ‘I’m sorry, I missed that.’ Both sides need to make sure they can hear each other clearly.” A clear explanation for how the process will work should also be provided in good time, including the necessary passwords and access links. And always have a plan B. “Let them have a telephone number so that if the technology fails, they can call you. And if something does go wrong, watch how the candidate reacts – if they completely lose their head, that actually tells you a little bit about how they operate under pressure.”Stone believes the Covid-19 lockdown could mark a seismic shift in the way companies operate going forward. “This episode has proven that you don’t have to stop in your entirety when something like this does occur,” he says. “We’ve got some clients who are interviewing remotely and then onboarding new recruits by video too, just having a laptop delivered to their house. They’re hiring highly skilled people having never met them in their lives.”If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee14a06d8f142358abeaa48309064adb26291ae8/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed6eae06cf1cebf79041fc4467b501f4","title":"tamzin outhwaite not all men want younger women","story":"The former EastEnders actor, who turns 50 this year, on her new menopause comedy, Dun Breedin’, how it felt to quit the square twice – and what it’s like to be pursued by the tabloidsNot many actors are able to work from home, but for a group of women, filming has started on a drama series – in lockdown. Tamzin Outhwaite, one of the cast, is lucky that her partner is a director (although he is not used to shooting on an old iPhone). Her 11-year-old daughter is also helping with the camerawork. Is it weird acting in front of her children? She gives a throaty laugh. “Of course it’s weird.”Outhwaite, still best known from her time in EastEnders, will star in Dun Breedin’, a comedy-drama created by the actor Julie Graham about a group of women brought together in a menopause support group. Outhwaite plays Indie, a free spirit who is trying to get through the hormonal change “with yoga and breathing. Other characters are like: ‘You need to get some HRT.’” As well as Graham, the other actors include Angela Griffin, Tracy Ann Oberman and Denise Welch (they are real-life friends), all filming their scenes from home to create 12 episodes, each just 10 minutes, to be shown on YouTube. The show aims to raise money for the Trussell Trust, the charity that organises UK food banks.The menopause, despite being a huge shift for many women, has traditionally been ignored, says Outhwaite, who turns 50 this year. “It’s just not really documented and if it is, it’s in health pamphlets, as opposed to drama and comedy,” she says. Isn’t it also because menopausal women are of the age when society, scandalously, traditionally starts to ignore them? “Absolutely, but the women I know of that age are some of the funniest people. The way that women deal with things at that age can be very comical. And a woman can still be sexy and going through her menopause.”Outhwaite says she found the first few weeks of the coronavirus crisis “really difficult”, although she knows she is lucky to be at home in north London, with her partner, Tom Child, and children, and with daily glimpses of her father, who is self-isolating from his home – a cabin built for him at the bottom of her garden. In positive moments, she says: “I think it will make us realise what really matters.” For Outhwaite, that is family and a job she loves.Just before Covid-19 hit, Outhwaite was appearing in the Chekhov play, The Seagull, in the West End. They had only done a few previews before the theatres were shut, a week before the lockdown. “We don’t know when we’re going to kick off again, or if we kick off again. Whether people will go to the theatre. Personally, I can’t wait to go back.”Outhwaite began her career on the stage – doing several years of musical theatre. She then spent a couple of years working regularly with the playwright Alan Ayckbourn, becoming one of his favoured actors, and was subsequently cast in EastEnders. She joined the soap in 1998, thinking she would just stay for three months and that it wouldn’t change her life much. “I thought: ‘This is just another acting job. It doesn’t mean that you’ve made it, because then you’ve got a whole heap of career to continue.’” Instead, she stayed for more than three years by the time Mel Owen – no-nonsense, husky voiced, gorgeous – was written out in 2002, she had married first Ian Beale, then local criminal Steve Owen, been kidnapped and arrested for suspected drug smuggling.During that period, when EastEnders was bringing in more than 10 million viewers, soap stars were the main focus of tabloid attention in the way that reality stars are now. Outhwaite was in her late 20s when she joined the cast, so says she felt relatively able to cope with the sudden fame. Were there times when it got too much? “Oh, yeah, there were many times when on a Friday night you’d get a phone call from the News of the World, or whatever, saying someone had tried to sell some story that was nonsense. It was a whole new world.” She was regularly followed by paparazzi. “There’s not a part of you that enjoys that. There is a feeling that you’re being spied on. Then your job is not just being an actor, you feel like some sort of public figure, but at the same time I never thought that I wanted to moan about it.” Her family and friends helped her keep perspective, she says. “When you think everyone’s reading nonsense about you, actually they’re not, because everyone’s busy with their own lives. But in your head it’s blown out of proportion.”It must be hard for an actor to decide (if they have a choice) to leave the security of a regular, high-profile job and try to make it in the wilds outside, knowing there is still a bit of snobbery about soap stars. For every Suranne Jones, there are dozens more who struggle to transfer their profile into other roles. Outhwaite already had her lead role as an army investigator in Red Cap, the BBC drama, lined up when she left and she says she didn’t feel any anxiety about her career. The work has been steady ever since, including the BBC dramas Hotel Babylon and New Tricks, although she has been more likely to pop up in shows as a guest star than the lead. There have also been numerous theatre roles, including another Ayckbourn production and a triumphant turn in the musical Sweet Charity.“When I hit 40, there were fewer scripts coming in,” she says. “It did feel like I wasn’t playing the leads in things, but that’s fine by me. I’m an ensemble actor, I really like to be in a company. I’m not desperate to have all of the responsibility on my shoulders. I haven’t really got much to moan about.” It was harder to leave EastEnders the second time, she admits (Mel returned to the square in 2018, and was killed off the following year), “because you’re older and you’ve got kids and the security’s actually quite lovely, it did feel different. I thought: ‘I wonder how I’m going to be able to move back into the acting world after this time round.’ But it’s been pretty nonstop. Until Covid.” She had a “lovely TV job” lined up that she’s not allowed to talk about. “I don’t know if that’s ever going to happen, but fingers crossed it does.”She says she only ever wanted to make a living from doing something she loved. “To go from job to job, that was success, that was enough for me. I wasn’t desperate to play a lead at the National. I really wanted to be in Cats the musical and that was kind of it,” she says with a laugh. It hadn’t occurred to Outhwaite, who grew up in Ilford, east London, and whose father worked at a newspaper printing plant and drove a black cab, that acting could be a job. “I didn’t come from a showbizzy kind of family, or even an artistic family,” she says. “It wasn’t until I started auditioning for performing arts schools when I was 15 and then I was like: ‘Oh, people do this for a living’.” She says she never had a life plan. “No plan for career, family, anything. Otherwise, it’s just disappointment, surely, because things don’t ever really go to plan.”Outhwaite’s time in EastEnders, even if the peak was some 20 years ago, created an enduring interest in her private life – it helped, then and now, that she was glamorous and had famous friends, such as the Spice Girl Emma Bunton, the Appleton sisters from the group All Saints, and the actor and presenter Amanda Holden. These days, her Instagram account is full of pictures of this girl gang, an instant nostalgia trip for anyone who yearns for the 90s, as well as cuddly selfies of Outhwaite with her boyfriend.Her orce from the actor Tom Ellis in 2014 was fairly public, and now she is fielding questions about her two-year relationship with her boyfriend, who is 21 years younger than her. Such a gap is rarely a big deal when it’s a man with a younger female partner, of course. “Whereas you cannot read anything about me without it saying ‘toyboy lover’,” she says with a laugh. “A woman being very sure of what she wants or what she is in her life doesn’t make her a cougar, because there are two people involved in this relationship. Not all men want younger women, that’s another thing. When you find someone you connect with, what, because you’re different ages you shouldn’t do that?” She says, and I can hear a wry smile in her voice, it’s not as if their age gap has come as a shock to them, something they have only read about in the newspapers. “We have thought about this, we have talked about this.” Has the interest put pressure on their relationship? No, she says. “At the beginning you think: ‘Can we do this?’ But the minute we became official and thought we’re all right with it, then no one else’s opinions matter, apart from my children.”Dun Breedin’ is available to view on YouTube and new episodes land every Thursday"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a62aa6bb20a0bb708e1ae146956a2a41dd8344/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53effc07cc36de3c7c5724ffb801ef24","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance wednesday","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:In Germany, all shops will reopen and amateur outdoor sports restart under certain conditions as part of an easing of lockdown measures, the federal government and states have agreed according to a draft document.The paper, seen by Reuters, was prepared by federal chancellery chief Helge Braun and the heads of the regional chancelleries for a telephone conference Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to hold with premiers of the 16 states later on Wednesday.Dated 5 May, the document shows that based on infection levels, states will decide on their own about a gradual opening of universities, restaurants, bars, hotels, trade fairs, cosmetic studios, brothels, theatres, fitness studios, cinemas and discos all under certain hygiene and distancing concepts.

Ferguson, an epidemiologist who has helped shape the government’s response to coronavirus and who advocated the lockdown, made the right decision to resign. Matt Hancock told Sky News: “I back the police here. They will take their decisions independently from ministers, that’s quite right, it’s always been like that.”Teenagers in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the Covid-19 pandemic began, have returned to school wearing masks and walking in single file past thermal scanners. In 121 schools, older pupils were back in classrooms – sitting at inidual desks spaced a metre apart – for the first time on Wednesday since the city was forced into shutdown in January. Returning pupils had to navigate thermal scanners at school gates, with anyone displaying a high temperature barred from entry.Spain looks set to extend its state of emergency for two more weeks as it eases Covid-19 lockdown measures, with the country’s prime minister expected to secure enough parliamentary votes today to make the move.Pedro Sanchez’s weak coalition government has the support of the regional Basque nationalist party PNV, as well as the centre-right Ciudadanos party, which said last night it would back an extension to the state of emergency set to expire on Saturday.In an increasingly fraught political government, it means the government will guarantee enough votes to approve the state of emergency decree.

We are not going back to where we were, to business as usual. The state has come back, and this episode will not be forgotten by the electorate. I don’t know where we are going, but one thing seems clear: we are not going back.Yanis Varoufakis: I like this phrase: capitalism has been suspended. The last time capitalism was suspended in the west was during the second world war, with the advent of the war economy: a command economy that fixed prices. The war economy marked the transcendence of the standard capitalist model.But what we see now is not so much the suspension of capitalism. The rules of capitalism may have been suspended – all those sacrosanct policies are gone, the neat separation of fiscal and monetary policy is gone, the idea that public debt is a bad thing is gone.But the institutions that are necessary to build “the war economy without war” so to speak – to suspend and transcend capitalism – those have not been put in place. There is a profound difference between saying: “It’s all going to shit, so we don’t expect you to stick to the rules,” and saying: “The rules themselves have changed, and we must make new ones to prevent an economic collapse.” All this talk of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank suggests that we remain very far from a war economy mindset.DM: This is a familiar category error in Europe. If you are basing your economic policy on the willingness of people who are too traumatised and sick to borrow – which is the core logic of quantitative easing – then you have a very serious problem. A common image of quantitative easing is the hose: a huge monetary hose, with water gushing out to stop the fire of crisis. But the hose of monetary policy is limited by this little valve called the banks, a little valve called the credit committee, a little valve called the “willingness of business to borrow money”. And ultimately, that hose of money becomes a trickle – and even that trickle stands to benefit the wealthy much more than the poor.So I take your point that despite the suspension of the rules, the infrastructure remains in place. But people across Europe are now saying: “Hey, there is an alternative.” This second phase will be about how we move ahead in rethinking capitalism, in rethinking finance, rethinking how economies work and for whom – potentially toward a new Bretton Woods-style settlement for the entire global economy.So that’s where we are: in the first year of the third decade of the 21st century. Looking out at the next decade, armed with history as well as economics, what do you think the global and European economy will look like?YV: We are sitting on a saddle point, prepared to tip in either direction. It is utterly indeterminate which of the two directions we travel.Let us start with the positive scenario. It builds from your point about the prospects for a new Bretton Woods – with its particular manifestation in the European Union.There is a glimmer of hope here, because there is a profound difference between 2020 and 2010. Back then, when Ireland and Greece went belly up, there were remarkable dissimilarities between what our countries were experiencing and what Germany was experiencing, what Holland was experiencing. Today, Germany’s industrial machine is broken – and was broken long before coronavirus hit. Two main industries – automobiles and machine tooling – were already in serious trouble. So the fact that Germany is now in the same pile of shit as the rest of us offers a glimmer of hope that they might say: what should we do? It’s no longer: “Your problem: here’s the Troika.”DM: And we will send you the bill as well! So that’s the positive scenario. The interruption of “business as usual” gives way to new policies and new possibilities for Europe and beyond. What’s the other option?YV: Well, we humans – and we Europeans, in particular – love to miss fantastic opportunities and end up with dystopian outcomes instead. It’s very likely that we will encounter the same recalcitrance by the same set of European ordoliberals, who will keep putting roadblocks in the way of moves toward a genuine, democratic federalism.DM: Obviously, such a roadblock will have a disproportionate impact on the southern member states of the European Union. What do you think the impact of this particular trauma will have on, say, Italy – a founding member of the European Union, and a crucial part of Europe’s emotional hinterland?YV: Every time there is a crisis in Europe, Italian growth rates fall. Every time there is a problem, Italy sinks deeper into stagnation – with Salvini waiting in the wings. If Frankfurt, Berlin, and Brussels fail again to move toward the positive scenario, Italy – not just Italy, but all of Europe’s most devastated regions – will move again toward the neo-fascist right. In that case, all bets are off.This is the endpoint of the negative scenario: a giant domino effect, leading to the disintegration of the European Union. Not that the EU will cease to exist. Only that it will become irrelevant, like the Commonwealth of Independent States.DM: Oh, I remember the Commonwealth of Independent States very well …YV: It still exists! It still has an office in Moscow. So the negative scenario is that the European Union will become like the CIS. And that will be music to the ears of the Trumps, Bolsonaros, and Modis of this world. We would move into a transactional, Hobbesian global economy: nasty, brutish, and poor for the majority of people.DM: When I was born in Ireland, the country was very poor. And then it became quite wealthy, on the back of the European project, on the back of Europe’s position in the global supply chain, and with a tax policy that attracted lots and lots of capital. My sense is this model might be gone, and this style of globalisation along with it. I fear that the period when you could travel, engage, move – we might have reached the end of that open period. People will say: “This virus came from the cosmopolitan world, from the world of international movement.” Whether it’s right or not, we might begin to blame people. We know that the Black Death resulted in ferocious antisemitism in Europe. People asked: “Who can we blame for this?” And so they blamed the one community that was already in isolation in the ghetto.This is what terrifies me most, sitting here in the first year of the third decade of the 21st century. What we saw before may come again, and we turn back to Yeats: “Turning and turning in the widening gyre  The falcon cannot hear the falconer  Things fall apart the centre cannot hold  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.” I fear now, unless we move quickly and in a new direction, the world that my kids will inherit is going to turn very nasty, indeed. So it’s a clarion call.YV: The loudest call in a generation. I share all of your concern for the future, although I must challenge the analysis on which it is based. The openness that you describe has always gone hand in hand with severe restriction: Nafta and the US-Mexico border freedom of movement in Europe and Frontex along the Mediterranean. This is not a contradiction it is the logic of a system that prizes the movement of capital over the freedom of human beings.If we fail now to stand together – to rally around a new Bretton Woods, to deliver the investments that humanity and the planet so desperately need – my fear is that this system will only deepen its cruel logic. Surfing on the hose of liquidity unleashed by the policies like quantitative easing, the financial sector will increase its grip on the global economy bankers are very good at getting rich from such volatility. So now is the time for us, here in Europe as around the world, to mobilise behind this shared vision of a global new deal. Because without it, the walls between us will only get taller and thicker: porous only to the money that flows through them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf49632701613cbfaaefeadc01905dced729d52a/86_0_1492_896/master/1492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0353fb697f7e3da9b6bb5bc0851e445","title":"uk tourism sector to flag attractions with physical distancing measures","story":"It comes amid fears people will be too scared to travel even after lockdown is easedUK tourism industry leaders plan to introduce a physical distancing standards symbol for hotels and attractions to encourage the return of visitors once lockdown measures are eased.The move is part of a bid to encourage responsible travel in the country when it is safe to do so.Visit Britain, the UK’s tourist authority, confirmed an industry mark, similar to the British Standards Institution’s Kitemark, to flag up attractions, and potentially accommodation, that have implemented safe distancing measures. It said it would provide more details when they were available.Visit Britain’s acting chief executive, Patricia Yates, said: “We think as an industry that’s going to be a real shift in where we are in consumer behaviour now.”Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said Visit Britain hoped to persuade ministers to think about encouraging tourism, after successfully persuading the population to stay at home in the coronavirus lockdown.She said the tourism industry would be “asking government to be just as clear when they start announcing the lifting of lockdown that it is socially responsible to go out and travel. And yes, you can drive and enjoy yourself”.The tourism industry is worth an estimated £127bn to the UK economy annually and employs more than 3 million people. Much of that income and employment has been cut off by the lockdown, amid forecasts that some of Britain’s most beautiful spots will be worse hit.The industry is worried the stay-at-home message has been so successful and overzealously interpreted, that it will require a new campaign to encourage people to venture out when it’s safe to do so.However, for the moment it cannot be seen to be encouraging travel when the message from the government is to stay at home.Police and councils have reminded potential tourists not to travel ahead of the bank holiday weekend.David Simpson, the leader of Pembrokeshire county council, said: “Pembrokeshire is a beautiful place and when the time is right, we will welcome you. But that time is not now.”The council and Dyfed Powys police have written to the owners of around 6,000 holiday homes, urging them to remain where they are.Key workers in north Devon have started a campaign to thank tourists for staying away from the area.Preston police reminded the public to stick to the physical distancing rules and only leave home to exercise or shop for essentials."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d00a3632073148b3a0ad9b471e276cc84948a5d/0_153_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=832bc681ac5ec941b5f3379278484d6e","title":"us union activism spikes amid coronavirus","story":"Activism spikes amid the pandemic nationwide as workers protest what they consider inadequate safety protections against Covid-19 Christopher Thomas, a call center operator in Lawrence, Kansas, said his employer has been dismayingly slow to protect the center’s more than 400 workers from Covid-19 – slow in making sure workers were at least 6ft apart, in getting them personal protective equipment and in assuring emergency sick leave.That dismay, Thomas explained, comes on top of long-festering anger over pay. His employer, a federal contractor named Maximus, has discussed reclassifying many workers in order to hold down their pay. Thomas and many co-workers have not received a raise for five years, he said. He makes $15.36 an hour after seven years on the job helping people from across the US apply for health insurance through the Obamacare marketplace.To Thomas’s mind, there has been one positive outgrowth from all this dismay – far greater interest in unionizing. In the last four weeks, he said, membership has nearly tripled in a workplace committee that includes many union supporters and is calling for increased pay and benefits and more transparency on basic work issues.“I support a union because I love what I do, and it would be nice to have better pay and benefits,” said Thomas, 32, who supports efforts to unionize with the Communications Workers of America. “If we have a union, we will have more power to tell Maximus to stop throwing us bare bones.”In recent weeks, there has been an extraordinary surge of anger and activism nationwide as workers have protested what they consider inadequate safety protections against Covid-19: at meatpacking plants, McDonald’s restaurants, Amazon warehouses, bus depots and grocery stores. Labor leaders applaud the walkouts and sickouts, and many of them are asking whether this spike in activism can be converted long-term into increased organizing and unionization and somehow reverse labor’s decades-long slide.The answer depends in part on how vigorously unions and other worker groups respond, but also on how successfully America’s many anti-union corporations respond in quelling this new militancy and any push for unionization. Some prominent companies have responded aggressively – Amazon has fired four outspoken worker leaders, including the leader of a walkout at its Staten Island warehouse, while Trader Joe’s CEO sent an anti-union letter to all employees.Monica Harris, who handles calls about Medicare at a Maximus facility in Chester, Virginia, cited another obstacle to unionizing: social distancing. “People are very interested in the union right now because we’re being required to come in under bad conditions,” Harris said, speaking last month. But she added: “You’re not really able to get in one-on-one, face-to-face contact with people right now.” Another impediment to expanding union support is that many Maximus employees are transitioning to work at home, although union organizers are increasingly using Zoom to speak with workers and even hold rallies.Covid-19 has already spurred new organizing. With the virus spreading and his grocery store getting more crowded, Ryan Hartson was growing worried about getting infected in his job as an Instacart in-store shopper in Chicago – he gathers fruits, vegetables and other groceries for customers. Hartson and several co-workers grew upset that Instacart hadn’t given them a mask or other PPE, hadn’t provided hazard pay and made it hard to get paid sick leave. So he joined the nationwide Instacart strike on 30 March involving in-store shoppers (whom Instacart considers employees) and Instacart food deliverers (Instacart says they are independent contractors). Federal law gives employees a right to unionize, but not independent contractors.At the time of the strike, “I was already in the middle of trying to organize my store,” Hartson said. Instacart shoppers at a Mariano’s grocery store in Skokie, Illinois, voted 10-to-4 to unionize in February, becoming the nation’s first Instacart workers to unionize. Hartson said Covid-19 gave added momentum to the effort at his store, and he was soon discussing unionization with Instacart workers in Austin, Boston, Miami and Orlando.“The pandemic led to the strike, and the strike led to this opportunity to organize workers all over this country,” Hartson said. “No question the pandemic has opened up a whole new dynamic in the labor movement.”Todd Crosby, organizing director for the United Food and Commercial Workers, said that with regard to Instacart’s in-store shoppers and its delivery workers – who he says are misclassified as independent contractors – “we are building a real organization at the workplace to win collective bargaining rights.” He added, “In some other places, like Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s, we’re working with activists to engage in rebellion and protest that may lead to a permanent organization and collective bargaining.”Tom Smith, national organizing director for the communications workers union, said coronavirus-related activism was setting the stage for longer-term organizing. “It’s changing people’s calculus,” he said. “Workers often sense they’re taking a risk when they’re acting collectively. But Covid-19 has turned some of that calculus on its ear. Yeah, maybe the boss will hold it against me. Maybe this will put my job in jeopardy. But I’m not going to put my life or my newborn’s life or my immuno-compromised parent’s life in danger.”Smith oversaw a conference call with 1,000 largely non-union workers about Covid-19 and near-term and longer-term steps. “All of this is leading folks to really step forward and take action,” he said. “This will be the first workplace confrontation for tens of thousands of people.” The result, he said, will be many new workplace leaders, groups and networks.Enad Alva, a Lyft driver in Alameda, California, helped organize recent protests to make sure Uber and Lyft drivers obtain unemployment benefits after many stopped driving because of a sharp drop-off in business and fears of infection. After those protests, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, pledged to make unemployment benefits available to these drivers, despite Uber’s and Lyft’s efforts to block such benefits.Alva, a leader of Gig Workers Rising, hopes California’s state legislature will give Uber and Lyft drivers a right to unionize, even though the Trump National Labor Relations Board has embraced Uber and Lyft’s view that the drivers are independent contractors and shouldn’t be allowed to unionize. “Our No 1 goal is to organize and unionize,” Alva said. “Drivers are increasingly seeing that nothing prevents Uber and Lyft from taking what they want unless we have a union.”Andrea Dehlendorf, co-executive director of United for Respect, a non-profit fighting for low-wage workers, predicts that Covid-19 will change how workers and the public view corporate America – and that that will in turn inspire more activism.“What’s been happening to working people in this country is like a frog in boiling water, where things get more dire and extreme, where there has been this slow burn of declining stability and voice, and this crisis turned up the heat and exposed just how unconscionably corporations treat workers in our economy and society,” Dehlendorf said. “This is not just a momentary surge in reaction to this particular crisis. This crisis is exposing just how inhumanly corporations are treating workers in a way that working people are not going to accept again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bd331d6d01d1d5c4fdc63e6360951239f015117/0_205_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=050ae8ba0064d0c48c2cc0b4f1482f86","title":"better world coronavirus young europeans democracy universal basic income","story":"Most Europeans support a universal basic income, yet young people doubt democracy’s capacity to deliver changeThose two contrasting but equally striking survey results show how high the stakes will be as we emerge from the immediate medical emergency, and face the subsequent economic pandemic and its political fallout. What kind of historical moment will this turn out to be, for Europe and the world? It could lead us to the best of times. It could lead us to the worst of times.The proposal for a universal basic income was until recently often dismissed as far-out and utopian. But during the anti-pandemic lockdowns, many developed countries have introduced something close to it. Spain’s economy minister has said that its “minimum vital income” could become a permanent instrument in the country’s system. Hardly a day passes now when I do not read another article suggesting that universal basic income, or some variant of it, is an idea whose time has come.This would be one ingredient of a possible future in which we managed to turn one of the greatest crises of the postwar world into one of its greatest opportunities. We can address the soaring inequality, both economic and cultural, which has been eroding the foundations even of established liberal democracies like Britain and the US. Having learned to work in different ways, more from home and with less unnecessary travel, we turn this into a new life-work model. After turning out on our balconies and rooftops, all across Europe, to applaud the doctors, nurses, social care and other essential workers, we do not forget them once the medical danger has passed. Not only do they get a better deal socially and economically – the postwar slogan “homes fit for heroes” comes to mind – but there is also what Polish populists slyly call a “redistribution of respect”. And in making that necessary redistribution, we also deprive the nationalist populists of their electoral appeal.At the same time, we recognise that a planet stalked by genuinely global threats, such as this virus and climate change, requires more international cooperation, not less. And the EU, which earlier this week convened an international meeting to raise funds for fighting Covid-19, becomes a prime mover of global collective action.That’s the dream. But then there’s the nightmare. This may be a postwar moment, but what if it turns out to be more like the years after the first world war than the post-1945 liberal and social democratic reconstruction. The nationalist impulses we see in Donald Trump and Xi Jinping become even more pronounced. With beggar-my-neighbour policies, the post-coronavirus recession descends into a great depression. Inequality soars, rather than being diminished, both within our societies and between different countries.Meanwhile, in the eastern half of the continent, Hungary remains a dictatorship, with Viktor Orbán’s temporary emergency powers mysteriously becoming permanent. Poland, where the governing party is currently, grotesquely, insisting on carrying out a presidential election entirely by postal ballot that cannot possibly be free and fair, follows down the Hungarian path. The EU, no longer a community of democracies, and torn along both its north-south and east-west axes, gradually weakens and disintegrates. Left to their own devices, its member states fail to provide adequate job prospects, social security and an ecologically sustainable future for their younger citizens. And so, as already shockingly foreshadowed in our poll, they turn to authoritarian solutions. Europe looks ever less to the US, ever more to China.Come 2030 we probably won’t have either this hell or that heaven, just some version of our usual human purgatory. But which variant we come closer to is entirely up to us: to Americans and Chinese, Russians, Indians and Brazilians, of course, but in Europe, it’s mainly up to us Europeans – including the post-Brexit British of course, who are still Europeans, whether they like it or not.That’s why, on the website that presents our survey results, we’ve also set up a self-interview facility for anyone with 10 minutes to spare to tell us your best and worst European moments, and your hopes for Europe in 2030. Thus far, the fall of the Berlin Wall has been the most widely mentioned formative moment and Brexit the top-scoring worst moment. But maybe this coronavirus moment will overtake them both.

Minister for Education Joe McHugh is holding discussions with parents, teachers, school managers and students to discuss the practicalities of running the exams in the context of social distancing and public health advice. One of the key challenges is that the July 29th date for the start of the exams is conditional on the health advice and the uncertainty this is causing for students. One proposed solution is the possible use of predictive grades. Ahead of the meeting it emerged that three-quarters of parents are unhappy with the current plans for the Leaving Certificate. The finding, in a soon to be published survey from the National Parents Council-Post Primary, shows that a “decision needs to be reached soon because the pressure and uncertainty on students and parents is unfair”, according to Paul Rolston, a spokesman for the council. Also on Wednesday a school principal suggested that “expected grades” based on the data already in schools should be considered instead of Leaving Certificate exams for 2020.Sharon McGrath, principal of Fingal Community College told RTÉ’s Today with Séan O’Rourke Show that there is an urgent need for a “plan B” as it was impossible to guarantee that the exams could go ahead on July 29th.There is a need for teachers, students, parents and the Department of Education to “sit around a table” and decide how best to respond, she said.Ms McGrath explained that “expected grades” could be based on data already held in schools. “We’re data rich, schools have grades going back five and six years.“There is a significant amount of information for each student in every school.”Points are like currency for the CAO to make decisions on who gets a college place, she said. Bands could be introduced for grades such as Band 1 is for those expected to achieve between 80 per cent and 100 per cent, Band 2 is for 60 per cent to 80 per cent. “Widening results to those bands doesn’t hold the same fear.”The CAO could have that information by July, added Ms McGrath. There is a six week window to look at that information. “They could look at the wider bands rather than the narrow grades.”Another school principal, Colm O’Rourke agreed and pointed out that the Department of Education has Junior Cert results and ‘Mocks’ results which could all be used to come up with expected Leaving Cert grades. If some students who in previous years would not have gotten into college, get a college place this year, that could be “the break of a lifetime,” he said.If students were not happy with the grades they were awarded then there should be the option of an exam in August, he said.Mr Rolston said these were good ideas as was the option of a Matriculation-type exam for specific courses. “There are numerous options out there to be explored, but there is huge dissatisfaction at the prospect of a sit down exam this year.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Testing is no longer confined to those in at-risk groups and will now include those who have a cough, fever or shortness of breath.

There have now been 1,339 Covid-19 related deaths in the Republic. The total number of cases stands at 21,983.The Irish College of General Practitioners said it welcomed the widening of the testing criteria.“This is a necessary step as restrictions are easing, “ said Dr Mary Favier, president of the ICGP. “We are increasingly confident the systems the HSE have put in place will be able to accommodate and manage the ramping up in the number of tests performed each week.“As we increase the number of tests, it is critically important that contact tracing is timely and appropriately organised in order to deal with the anticipated rise. If a test result is positive, Public Health must ensure they quickly trace that person’s contacts so that we are then managing the ongoing spread of the disease.”Timeline of testing criteriaFrom mid-March, just one symptom was necessary to become eligible for a test. Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said around 20,000 people a day had been seeking a test at the time and acknowledged that the net may have been cast too widely “in good faith’’. Changes to the testing criteria were made in late March and those with symptoms of the disease also had to belong to one of several priority groups, such as healthcare workers, close contacts of a confirmed case, pregnant women or those suffering from some chronic conditions in order to qualify for testing.Since late April, the testing criteria were slightly relaxed, with one symptom plus membership of a priority group making someone eligible for testing.

The total number of cases stands at 21,983.Dr Tony Holohan acknowledged the NPHET public health advice to the Government was conservative and cautious due to the risk of a resurgence of infection.“We need to be in a position to satisfy ourselves that the easing of any restrictions does not lead to untoward spread of the disease.”“If we lose control and see the rate of spread we had in March continuing unabated, that could lead to a significant challenge for the health system and a significant impact on people and could lead to a walking-back of restrictions we’ve already eased.”It was “not true” that “we’ve done the job or that we’ve passed the point of risk”, he said.Sources have said, however, that the easing of restrictions under the Government’s Covid-19 “road map” could be accelerated later in the summer if current progress is maintained.ICU figuresWith the number of patients in ICU falling, and the rate of growth of new cases having plateaued despite more testing, there is optimism in official circles that the easing of some restrictions could be brought forward to earlier phases in the plan.The 211 new cases reported by the NPHET on Tuesday is the lowest daily figure in over a month, while the growth in new cases has been lower than 2 per cent for nine days. The number of patients in intensive care has been dropping at a rate of about 20 a week, though the number of hospitalisations remains high. The fact that about 3 per cent of samples are testing positive is seen as an indication that the chains of transmission of the disease are being broken.Dr Holohan also denied reports of tensions between NPHET and some Cabinet members, saying he has had a “perfectly straightforward interaction” with Ministers.Unlike in some other countries, “We’ve been able to get on with our job”, he said.Officials said 214, 761 people have been tested for the virus, including 61,707 in the past week.

The Department has clarified its guidance in relation to leaving the house for those who were asked to cocoon, which includes people over 70 and others in very high risk groups. It said cocooners can also drive, cycle or walk within 5kms of their home. While those who had been advised to cocoon at home are now free to go outside to exercise, the Government has urged them to avoid contact with others and avoid visiting shops. Until Tuesday, people over 70 were asked to stay at home in all circumstances, a recommendation which caused resentment from some of those in that age bracket. This was reflected in a statement from the Irish Senior Citizens’ Parliament last week. It said: “Blanket ‘cocooning’ based purely on age is difficult and some view it as ageist. They are law abiding, but are beginning to question the blanket ban.” On Tuesday the allowed distance for exercise for the general population was increased from 2km to 5km of their homes. In response to questions from The , a spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the 5km radius is not just for exercising and that driving within this zone is allowed. She said: “Those who have been advised to cocoon, including those who are over 70 years ofd age, are advised to stay at home as much as possible. “However, from May 5th, those who have been advised to cocoon may go out for a drive within 5kms of their home.” However, the Government has stressed that people should only leave their homes to get some exercise, or for essential journeys such as to shop for food, obtain medicines or attend a doctor. Under the regulations, it is an offence for a person to leave his or her place of residence, unless the person has a “reasonable excuse” for doing so.The Department has previously clarified that cocooning is advisory rather than mandatory and the State has no powers to sanction anybody who does not cocoon. This remains the case. This drew an angry response from the retired Church of Ireland archbishop John Neill (74) who said both he and his wife were “extremely annoyed that we older people have been deceived and misled in the midst of” the current Covid-19 crisis. He suggested there appeared “to have been a deliberate attempt to mislead in public advertising” by the Government on the issue. On June 8th, the 5km limit will be extended to 20km, though social interaction between households will remain limited.From that date people will be allowed to take part in outdoor sporting and fitness activities, involving team sports training in small groups (but not matches) where social distancing can be maintained and where there is no contact.Not until July 20th will the restrictions on movement be lifted entirely.

Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGettyThe British government has been accused of being “petty”, “provocative” and “unhelpful” after it rejected a request for the European Union to have a permanent office in Belfast. British cabinet office Minister Michael Gove responded to the North’s four pro-Remain parties – Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Alliance and the Greens – to say that an office was unnecessary.Mr Gove said it would facilitate, where necessary, ad hoc visits by EU officials to Northern Ireland but it did not accept any permanent EU presence was required in Northern Ireland.The four parties wrote to the British prime minister Boris Johnson last month urging that an EU office be re-established. The EU also made a request for an office in Belfast.The previously permanent European Commission office closed at the end of January when the UK quit the EU.There was an expectation at the time that some form of EU presence would be created later to assist continuing EU-UK business, but Mr Gove, responding on behalf of Mr Johnson, appears to have closed down that possibility.The current stance of the British government appears in direct contrast to its position in February last year when it said it not only supported having an EU office in Belfast but in London, Edinburgh and Cardiff as well.Just over a week ago Mr Gove told British MPs there was no need for a “mini embassy” in Belfast.In the 2016 referendum, 56 per cent of the electorate in Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU.EU fundingNotwithstanding the negative response, the Irish Government appears not to have given up hope that an office might yet be created. Previous figures from the European Commission office in Belfast show that going back to 1989 the EU supported the peace process, agriculture, fisheries, jobs and much more to the tune of more than €13 billion. It also plans to continue providing peace funding in the North.“We would see no issue in terms of the Good Friday agreement in having an EU office in Northern Ireland, not least given ongoing EU support for the peace process,” said a Department of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman on Sunday.“The Irish Government hopes this matter can be accommodated in a way that satisfies both sides’ needs and sensitivities,” she added.The Sinn Féin MP for North Belfast John Finucane said Mr Gove’s “mini embassy” comments were “provocative and deeply unhelpful at a crucial period in Brexit negotiations”.“The ongoing opposition by the British government to a European Union office in the North is in bad faith,” he said.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the British government response was “petty” but “unsurprising”.Alliance leader Naomi Long also described the decision as “petty”.“This gamesmanship from the UK government is reflective of their wider approach of not taking preparations for the implementation of the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol seriously,” she said. The DUP and Ulster Unionist Party, however, supported the British government’s position. In a brief statement, a DUP spokesman said, “We agree with UK government policy.”The Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said there was no need for a permanent office in Belfast“The idea of EU ‘perm reps’ with extra jurisdiction powers like the EU had in the Balkans is simply not acceptable in the UK – and it is inconceivable that any EU country would accept that on their sovereign territory,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Alan BetsonThe An expert review into electronic voting in the Dáil has recommended installing extra cameras in the chamber at a cost of about €50,000 to prevent TDs from voting for their colleagues.The party’s former Brexit spokeswoman, Lisa Chambers, also said that in one vote she had mistakenly sat in deputy leader Dara Calleary’s seat and voted before moving to her own seat to vote again.In a review of the current voting system, Prof David Farrell of UCD presented five options for reform, which are: chip card readers, a two-hand voting system, biometrics, voting displays and additional cameras.“Of the various options available to prevent Deputies intentionally, or otherwise, voting on behalf of another Deputy, the installation of additional cameras to record the act of voting would seem the best on grounds of effectiveness and cost,” he wrote.The cameras “would provide a definitive record in the event of any future challenge to the veracity of a vote”.The review also recommended that the seat designations of each Deputy be indicated by a sticker with his or her name on it located prominently on the seat.Voting displaysAnother option which was explored was a change to voting displays which are currently mounted above the press gallery which overlooks the chamber.“Currently the display maps each voting seat and a colour-coded light illuminates to show how the seat has voted (Yes, No, Abstain). There are ways in which the display could be modified, such as providing party totals, or by including the names andor photographs of Deputies,” the review states.However, this option would be “difficult and costly to implement” and would cost up to €123,000 per display.Another option involved the use of biometrics, such as fingerprint reading, where a fingerprint reader at each seat would record each TD’s fingerprint.The report says that the Italian lower house uses this system and it was also used in Luxembourg before being abandoned on foot of complaints from MPs.The report says there would be “significant costs” of up to €600,000 associated with this reform.Other possibilities for change include two-hand voting, which is used in the Indian parliament, where in order to vote a representative must press two separate buttons, the present button and one of the voting buttons, simultaneously. This would cost up to €140,000.The possible use of chip card readers was also considered by the report.“This system does not prevent a Deputy from giving their card to a colleague to vote on their behalf,” the review says, with this option costing up to €80,000."},{"url":null,"title":"readers chatroom1","story":"Right now, everyone has more time than ever to talk to each other online and to meet new people, albeit virtually.  If you\u0027d like a place to chat about the biggest news stories of the day come and join us and your fellow readers in the comments. We\u0027ve suggested a few talking points, to get you started – but don\u0027t feel limited by our choices.

We would advocate trialling easing restrictions very gradually.To maintain public trust and support, it will be important to have acceptable and equitable criteria for selecting which activities can be resumed. For example, it may be difficult to justify easing restrictions solely for economic activities without any easing of restrictions for low-risk activities with significant social and psychological benefit.Methods that have been used successfully for helping people understand how to implement other behaviour changes (such as healthy eating) include providing a \u0027traffic light\u0027 list of examples of high (avoid), medium (do rarely and carefully) and low (do freely) risk activities and \u0027modelling\u0027 stories describing how other people like themselves in similar situations have overcome barriers to implement guidance successfully, it says. The document also suggests that health and safety legislation should be used to address coronavirus infection control risks at work. The two-metre social distancing rule is currently being reviewed by the Government in the hope that relaxing it could allow businesses and schools to reopen.But Sir Patrick told MPs that the infection risk at one metre was as much as 30 times higher than that at two metres, saying: The evidence is – as far as you can get very firm evidence on this – that essentially a minute at two metres contact is about the same risk as six seconds at one metre, so that gives you some idea of why the two metres becomes important. And the risk at one metre is about 10 to 30 times higher than the risk at two metres, so the distancing is an important part of this.In a briefing document considered by Sage on April 14, scientists said managers may prioritise those who have tested positive when offering jobs. This could lead to widespread gaming of the system in which people desperate for work deliberately get infected with Covid-19, they said.  Alternatively, a black market for counterfeit positive test results could emerge.It might also allow parts of the country to leave lockdown earlier than others, a strategy Sir Patrick acknowledged is being examined. Promises of home testing kits were quickly dashed when it emerged the technology was not accurate enough, but there are hopes laboratory-based blood testing systems will be available this month.  Sir Patrick said geographical variations could mean certain parts of the country come out of lockdown sooner, adding: We know that cities and densely-populated places have a higher prevalence than rural places... and an option that could be considered is to think about whether measures could be done locally versus nationally.Masks may have a marginal positive effect in those situations, or face coverings of some sort, he said. Where masks have a role is where distancing may not be possible. So there may be some cases where that is not possible, situations where there is undue crowding when wearing masks may be beneficial to stop the spread. Sir Patrick said scientists have now been able to sequence thousands and thousands of viral genomes when looking at Covid-19, and found cases came from Europe.One of the things that it looks like, very clearly, is that early in March the UK got many, many different imports of virus from many different places, he said. And those were particularly from European countries with outbreaks.Mass school closures would increase the likelihood of avoiding ICU capacity being breached across the country, it said, with the decision to close schools taken on the same day the paper was drawn up.I\u0027d be amazed if, when we look back, we don\u0027t think: \u0027Yep we could have done something differently,\u0027 Sir Patrick told MPs.But he insisted: It\u0027s completely wrong to think of testing as the answer – it\u0027s just part of the system that you need to get right.If we had unlimited capacity, and the ongoing support beyond that, then we perhaps would choose a slightly different approach, she said. Sir Patrick also suggested that allowing the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead may have been a an error, saying he had no doubts there would have been occasions where things could have been done differently. There will be times where you look back at and say things could have been done differently – I\u0027ve got no doubts about that. On the wider issue of the lockdown, he said: When you look at everything that has happened and the speed in which it happened, maybe days either side may have made a difference.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"volunteers go lockdown scottish rewilded estate help save 100000","story":"Conservationists have gone into lockdown on a Scottish \u0027rewilding\u0027 estate in order to help save more than 100,000 trees.A team of six people from Trees for Life have been voluntarily isolating themselves at the charity’s flagship Dundreggan rewilding estate in Glenmoriston, near Loch Ness in the Highlands since 23 March.They are living at the lodge in Dundgreggan which sleeps 12 people.

A shambles of mixed messaging, poor organisation and a complacent attitude that what was happening in Italy wouldn\u0027t happen here, he said.The decision taken on March 12 to abandon mass testing has also been questioned, with the Herald and others suggesting this meant the Government could only guess who was infected with the virus and how it was behaving, meaning the extent of its spread would not become obvious until hospitals began to fill with seriously ill patients.Across the Atlantic similar questions are being asked.CNN this week broadcast a three-minute package asking what went wrong with the UK’s initial handling of the virus, showing footage of packed Tube trains from the period before a lock down was implemented, along with flashbacks to early Government briefings when the concept of Britain acquiring ‘herd immunity’ guided its thinking.The New Yorker Magazine has been even more forthright in its criticism - just as it has been of the Trump administration’s response. In an article published on Tuesday it characterised Britain’s handling of the pandemic as “a curious mixture of superiority and fatalism... which has been slow and calamitous”.The magazine pointed out that Britain has an “internationally respected public-health apparatus” and that in October 2016 the UK government’s Exercise Cygnus had shown how a global influenza pandemic would overwhelm the nation’s health system and ravage the economy.Despite this it says British officials “dithered” in the face of reports of a new coronavirus coming out of China and continued to hesitate as the virus tore through Northern Italy, just at the point lessons needed to be learnt, and quickly.The British government’s short-lived adherence to the herd immunity theory has also been criticised in Turkey, where the state-run Anadolu news agency published an op-ed by a researcher in international politics at Istanbul University suggesting that this “distracted and prevented” the UK government from taking necessary steps, just at the time when they could have had significant impact on stemming the spread of the virus.Separately, the Reuters news agency focused In a special report published on Tuesday on Britain’s failure to protect the elderly and their carers.Highlighting among others the case of 26-year-old care home worker Sonya Kaygan, one of over 100 UK frontline health workers killed by coronavirus, it pointed out that care homes struggled to get access to tests and PPE.It also suggested the elderly were put at “potentially greater risk by measures to admit only the sickest for hospital treatment and to clear out as many non-acute patients as possible from wards” in order to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed.Worse was to come, states the report, with the measures needed to protect the elderly in care homes,  such as testing and supplies of PPE, simply not available.In Spain, El País last week ran a stinging editorial, describing the UK government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic as “incomprehensible”, with the article singling out Boris Johnson for special criticism after he “turned a deaf ear to the severity of the crisis for several weeks, to the point that he declined to attend five emergency committee meetings and instead enjoying twelve joyful days of vacation”.The initial plan of promoting herd immunity is also slammed in the editorial as an “uncompassionate” approach and a “Darwinian calculation”, while also noting how the UK continued to allow planes from countries with large epidemics to land long after the risks of doing so were obvious.“Everything points to Johnson choosing to disguise the economic and social costs of his hard Brexit with the even harder blows from the multiple crisis the pandemic is already causing the pandemic,” the article concludes.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"germany eyes accelerated return normality","story":"Even after initial steps to open up were introduced from April 20, the number of new infections remained low, the document said. It added that no new wave of infection had so far been detected, justifying the series of bolder reopening steps.Schools had already been allowed to open, but only to older children so far. Likewise, only shops up to a certain size were allowed to do business.But in the broader easing of stay-at-home measures, Angela Merkel\u0027s government will now throw all school gates and shops open, provided that hygiene measures, including maintaining social distance, are kept up.The Bundesliga will become the first of Europe\u0027s top five leagues to restart – something that Health Minister, Jens Spahn, said could make the competition an export hit.Only the cultural sector would have to wait, with large events remaining cancelled until the end of August. Borders also remain closed.The agreement came just hours before Mrs Merkel is due to confer with Germany\u0027s 16 state premiers to take stock of the development of infections since Europe\u0027s biggest economy first took steps to lift some restrictions.The restrictions, along with greater testing capacities, have seen Germany keep its death rate far lower than those of its European neighbours.Experts have urged restraint, with the head of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for disease control warning of possible second or third waves of the virus hitting the country. As elsewhere, Mrs Merkel\u0027s government is walking a tightrope between preventing new deadly outbreaks and containing the already devastating economic impact of the lockdown measures.With the economy now in deep recession and the ranks of jobless swelling, complaints are growing against Mrs Merkel\u0027s conservative approach, which won her a rise in support in the early days of the pandemic.In recent days, many state premiers have ignored her pleas for caution on easing coronavirus restrictions. On the eve of her discussions with regional leaders, Germany\u0027s biggest state, Bavaria, pre-empted federal measures by announcing that its restaurants would open from May 18 and hotels and guest houses from May 30.State premier Markus Soeder said the time has come for a cautious reopening, pointing to the success in containing the spread of the virus.Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saarland and Saxony-Anhalt have also announced their own plans for everything from restaurants to care homes.The North Rhine-Westphalia state premier, Armin Laschet, who has criticised Mrs Merkel\u0027s firmer stance on restrictions, told public broadcaster ARD late last month that the negative effects of the lockdown must be weighed up.He attacked what he said were the pessimistic predictions of some medical experts, pointing out that 40 percent of intensive care beds are empty in his state.Demonstrations against the lockdown were held in several German cities last weekend, and a new political movement calling itself Widerstand 2020 (Resistance 2020) claims on its website to have more than 100,000 members.The far-right AfD, Germany\u0027s largest opposition party by number of MPs, has also attacked the lockdown measures.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 6th may 2020","story":"A boy wearing a protective face mask touches a wall of graffiti outside the New York Aquarium, BrooklynCoronavirus latest news: Government to drop \u0026#39Stay at home\u0026#39 messaging this weekend ahead of PM\u0026#39s announcement on exit from lockdownBackstreet barbers operating in breach of social distancing VE Day 2020: why is it a bank holiday and how can you celebrate in lockdown?Politics latest news: Boris Johnson pledges new 200,000 test target  Elon Musk authors the craziest celebrity baby name to dateWatch: Beluga whales head to world\u0026#39s first open-water sanctuary of its kindThe British victims of coronavirus and their personal storiesIkea plans re-opening of UK stores by the end of MayBritain criticised around the world for \u0026#39complacent\u0026#39 and \u0026#39calamitous\u0026#39 coronavirus responseComfort food: Italians and French gain more thank two kilos on average during coronavirus lockdownComment: Snobbish disdain for the Isle of Wight proves coronavirus hasn\u0026#39t really united BritainLlama hidden in secret Belgian location could defeat coronavirusCoronavirus positive: Good news round-up – a llama to the rescueThese are the health workers who have died from coronavirusWatch: Archie Mountbatten-Windsor celebrates his first birthday with charity storybook campaign Comment: Global Britain brings hope to small countries in Russia’s shadowDo as I say...

But if a person is in the southern hemisphere, they may be able to see the stars of its system on a dark, clear night, without need for a telescope.We were totally surprised when we realised that this is the first stellar system with a black hole that can be seen with the unaided eye, said\u0026nbspPetr\u0026nbspHadrava, Emeritus Scientist at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic in Prague and co-author of the research.\u0027Cosmic killer\u0027 black hole could solve space mysteryThe system was first observed as part of a study on double-star systems, with scientists watching it to better understand those solar systems that have two suns. But they were shocked to find that one particular example appeared to be hiding a black hole, which had previously not been discovered.It is one of the first black holes to be found that does not interact violently with its environment, meaning that it is truly black, and not visible due to its impact on other visible objects like stars. Instead, astronomers spotted its presence by watching the orbit of the system\u0027s inner star – which seemed to be disturbed by some large, mysterious object.An invisible object with a mass at least 4 times that of the Sun can only be a black hole, said\u0026nbspESO\u0026nbspscientist Thomas\u0026nbspRivinius, who led the study.One of the two stars seems to orbit around the unseen object every 40 days, while the other sits at a further distance from both. That meant that astronomers had to watch the system over a longer period, allowing them to get a picture of the orbits over several months of observations.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Almost all of them had strong interactions with their environment, meaning that they could be detected by the powerful X-rays that behaviour flings through space.The new paper, \u0027A naked-eye triple system with a nonaccreting black hole in the inner binary\u0027, is published in\u0026nbspAstronomy \u0026amp Astrophysics.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, it said more normal shopping patterns have returned in recent weeks.In an attempt minimise the risk of spreading Covid-19, Ocado has introduced contact-free deliveries, temperature monitoring for staff, and regular testing of frontline workers.The sales update came as Ocado prepared to face anger at its annual meeting over chief executive Tim Steiner\u0027s £58.7m pay deal for last year.Ocado isn\u0027t the only grocer enjoying bumper sales. Consumers are making fewer trips to the shops but are spending more when they do venture out, according to data from analysts Kantar. Grocery sales in Britain rose by 5.5 per cent year-on-year in the four weeks to 19 April, Kantar said.Ocado said it expects the long-term shift towards online grocery to accelerate post-crisis but said it is unable to provide guidance for its outlook for the rest of the year due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.Mr Steiner said: We are facing quite a different challenge to many, as we scale up Ocado to play its part in feeding the nation, and as we help our clients launch and roll out their online businesses more rapidly against a backdrop of a likely long-term increase in demand for online.Ocado remains in a strong position and, while we should be grateful that our current challenges are around growth, expansion and increased demand, we have great empathy for all who are facing different challenges at this time.In retail, we are working with our small suppliers to make sure we pay them earlier than normal and we will work closely with any who are struggling.Ocado\u0027s 40 per cent sales jump added to a 10 per cent increase in the first quarter of its financial year. Established in 2000, it is now a joint venture with Marks \u0026amp Spencer after a tie-up between the two companies agreed last year. M\u0026ampS announced this week that it would introduce a new 30-minute delivery service in some areas.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More significantly, it offered few specifics on when many of its isions might return to normal operations or how it would make up shortfalls in the interim.As its theme parks began to be shuttered, movies could not be released and sports could be played, Disney saw total operating income drop 37 per cent to $2.4bn (£1.9bn) in the quarter ending 31 March. Parks and cruises had profit go from $1.5bn (£1.2bn)\u0026nbspin the quarter last year to $639m\u0026nbsp(£514m) this year, with a loss of about $1bn in revenue.Earnings-per-share, meanwhile, dropped to just 60 cents, a 63 per cent decline compared to the same quarter a year ago and lower than the 89 cents many forecasters expected.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThose reduced numbers were cushioned by the fact that much of the quarter played out before the crisis hit in the US, and many analysts and investors believe the worse is yet to come. The quarter, for instance, included only a few weeks of the park shutdowns in the US.And team sports, on which Disney cable network ESPN heavily relies, were not suspended until about the same time. The company currently lacks a wide range of revenue streams for the new quarter, which runs through June there is no timetable, for instance, on the reopening of US\u0026nbsptheme parks.Created with Sketch.The 25 most anticipated movies and TV shows on Disney+ Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This $100m series created by Jon Favreau is one of six originals teased by Disney for the launch of the streaming platform (with more to come in the future).

Tessa Thompson, Justin Theroux, Sam Elliott, Ashley Jensen, Janelle Monáe and Benedict Wong voice the canines while Kiersey Clemons, Thomas Mann, Yvette Nicole Brown, Adrian Martinez and Ken Jeong all appear in human form.Another original, Encore! is led by host and executive producer Kristen Bell. In this reality series, high school students are tasked with re-creating a performance of a musical they all performed together back in the day.Speaking of high schools and musicals, Disney is reviving the franchise that propelled Zac Efron to global fame in 2006. This scripted mockumentary series is set in a fictionalised version of the (real) East High School in Salt Lake City, Utah, which served as a filming location for the original films. A (fictional) former cast member begins work as a drama teacher at the (fictional) school and decides to stage a performance of – you guessed it – High School Musical: The Musical.525 Almost all the Star Wars films you could possibly wantDisney’s making the most out of its 2012 $4bn purchase of LucasFilm by including The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and The Force Awakens on its launch catalogue. More Star Wars offerings will follow at a later date.625 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)The first Disney film ever created is surprisingly hard to stream in the US . While it’s not unusual for pop culture classics to be available to rent at a low price on various platforms, for example, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is only available for purchase at $14.99 – about the same price as a DVD (remember DVDs?). This makes the 1937 classic a desirable component of Disney’s back catalogue, which might help bring new subscribers to Disney+.The situation for Pinocchio is the same as for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: this Disney classic isn’t available to stream cheaply on other platforms, meaning it’s a strong pick from Disney’s back catalogue. Besides, it’s November and people need something to do between the end of Spooky Season and the official start of the holiday period – and rewatching Disney classics is as good an option as any.This classic – Disney’s third-ever animated feature film – isn’t available to stream legally on any other platform in the US, making it another desirable addition to the Disney+ catalogue.If you’ve ever wanted to do a deep e into the heartbreaking tale of the circus elephant born with too-big ears, now’s the time: the 1941 animated film and Tim Burton’s 2019 live-action remake are both featured on Disney+’s launch catalogue.If you’re trying to watch all of Marvel’s films in the order of release, Disney+ has your back – partly. Iron Man, Iron Man 3, Thord: The Dark World, s of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame have all joined the platform.Ahead of the release of Frozen 2 on 22 November, viewers will be able to brush up on Arandelle’s history by revisiting the first installment in Elsa and Anna’s adventures.Both the 1987 series and the first season of the 2016 reboot will be available on launch day. Did someone say “woo-ooh”?1325 Lady and the Tramp (1955)Before you watch the live-action reboot, you can revisit the love story of perhaps the most famous Cocker Spaniel and Schnauzer mix in animated form.The fifth animated feature film released by Disney was inducted into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2011 – in case you needed an excuse to rewatch it.There’s never a bad time to rewatch Pixar’s poetic 2015 release in which Amy Poehler voiced Joy, Bill Hader voiced Fear, Lewis Black brought Anger to life, and Mindy Kaling stole the show as Disgust.Meg Cabot’s young adult novel of the same name was so great that it’s nothing short of a miracle that the 2001 film adaptation, starring Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway, did it justice. Eighteen years after its release, it has become a certified classic.Another Disney classic that’s hard to stream elsewhere, Cinderella has been added to the treasure trove of vintage films supporting the Disney+ launch.1825 A comprehensive visit to Wonderland (1951, 2010)Both the 1951 animated Alice in Wonderland and the 2010 live-action version directed by Tim Burton have been added to the platform.Yes, the Lost Boys are set to support the Disney+ launch on 12 November. It’s been 66 years since the film – Disney’s 14th animated feature – was released, and its nostalgic appeal remains intact.A moving animated film featuring one of the most adorable robots in the history of cinema AND delivering a much-needed warning about environmental neglect? WALL-E has all the makings of an instant classic.The 2019 live-action remake of Aladdin wasn’t the monumental success it could have been (“This Is Not What You Wished For”, read one New York Times headline), so why not revisit the 1992 version with Robin Williams as the Genie? Kuzco was selfish, narcissistic, spoiled… and hilarious. The Emperor’s New Groove lives on as one of Disney’s most quotable animated films.While Mulan wasn’t born into royalty (nor does she marry into a royal family), the character has long been part of the official princesses line-up flaunted by Disney. She’s just that heroic.Disney is giving the iconic sitcom starring Hilary Duff as a shy middle-schooler a second life – which makes sense, given that Duff is reprising the role in an upcoming reboot of the franchise that will be featured on Disney+.This documentary unveiled by National Geographic focuses not just on dogs, but on extraordinary dogs.

While it’s not unusual for pop culture classics to be available to rent at a low price on various platforms, for example, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is only available for purchase at $14.99 – about the same price as a DVD (remember DVDs?). This makes the 1937 classic a desirable component of Disney’s back catalogue, which might help bring new subscribers to Disney+.The situation for Pinocchio is the same as for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: this Disney classic isn’t available to stream cheaply on other platforms, meaning it’s a strong pick from Disney’s back catalogue. Besides, it’s November and people need something to do between the end of Spooky Season and the official start of the holiday period – and rewatching Disney classics is as good an option as any.This classic – Disney’s third-ever animated feature film – isn’t available to stream legally on any other platform in the US, making it another desirable addition to the Disney+ catalogue.If you’ve ever wanted to do a deep e into the heartbreaking tale of the circus elephant born with too-big ears, now’s the time: the 1941 animated film and Tim Burton’s 2019 live-action remake are both featured on Disney+’s launch catalogue.If you’re trying to watch all of Marvel’s films in the order of release, Disney+ has your back – partly. Iron Man, Iron Man 3, Thord: The Dark World, s of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame have all joined the platform.Ahead of the release of Frozen 2 on 22 November, viewers will be able to brush up on Arandelle’s history by revisiting the first installment in Elsa and Anna’s adventures.Both the 1987 series and the first season of the 2016 reboot will be available on launch day. Did someone say “woo-ooh”?1325 Lady and the Tramp (1955)Before you watch the live-action reboot, you can revisit the love story of perhaps the most famous Cocker Spaniel and Schnauzer mix in animated form.The fifth animated feature film released by Disney was inducted into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2011 – in case you needed an excuse to rewatch it.There’s never a bad time to rewatch Pixar’s poetic 2015 release in which Amy Poehler voiced Joy, Bill Hader voiced Fear, Lewis Black brought Anger to life, and Mindy Kaling stole the show as Disgust.Meg Cabot’s young adult novel of the same name was so great that it’s nothing short of a miracle that the 2001 film adaptation, starring Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway, did it justice. Eighteen years after its release, it has become a certified classic.Another Disney classic that’s hard to stream elsewhere, Cinderella has been added to the treasure trove of vintage films supporting the Disney+ launch.1825 A comprehensive visit to Wonderland (1951, 2010)Both the 1951 animated Alice in Wonderland and the 2010 live-action version directed by Tim Burton have been added to the platform.Yes, the Lost Boys are set to support the Disney+ launch on 12 November. It’s been 66 years since the film – Disney’s 14th animated feature – was released, and its nostalgic appeal remains intact.A moving animated film featuring one of the most adorable robots in the history of cinema AND delivering a much-needed warning about environmental neglect? WALL-E has all the makings of an instant classic.The 2019 live-action remake of Aladdin wasn’t the monumental success it could have been (“This Is Not What You Wished For”, read one New York Times headline), so why not revisit the 1992 version with Robin Williams as the Genie? Kuzco was selfish, narcissistic, spoiled… and hilarious. The Emperor’s New Groove lives on as one of Disney’s most quotable animated films.While Mulan wasn’t born into royalty (nor does she marry into a royal family), the character has long been part of the official princesses line-up flaunted by Disney. She’s just that heroic.Disney is giving the iconic sitcom starring Hilary Duff as a shy middle-schooler a second life – which makes sense, given that Duff is reprising the role in an upcoming reboot of the franchise that will be featured on Disney+.This documentary unveiled by National Geographic focuses not just on dogs, but on extraordinary dogs. Enough said.“Today\u0027s not the point,” said Lloyd Greif, a veteran Los Angeles-based investment banker who closely follows Disney. “We haven\u0027t seen ugly yet. Third and fourth quarter is where the rubber will really hit the road.”Disney\u0027s executives had few answers for analysts on what they could do to stem the tide until the American entertainment economy can resume at anything close to full capacity. They pointed to few scattered revenue-drivers, such as high ratings for its ESPN documentary series\u0026nbspThe Last Dance\u0026nbspand growing subscriptions for Disney Plus, as a way of keeping dollars flowing.Instead, executives sought to paint a longer-term picture that relied on more general advantages like the trustworthiness of the Disney brand.“As someone who\u0027s been around for a while and led the company through some really tough days\u0026nbsp... I have absolute confidence we\u0027ll get through this challenging period and recover successfully,” Bob Iger, the company\u0027s executive chairman and until several months ago its chief executive, told analysts in a call.He said he thought it “quite possible” Disney\u0027s properties will now resonate with consumers more than ever. “People find comfort and inspiration in our messages of hope and optimism,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWhy have share prices been rising while economies have been tanking?Mr Iger, the often-celebrated chief executive who stepped down shortly before the crisis erupted in the US\u0026nbspto focus on content, has retaken more of a public role from successor Bob Chapek as he tries to right the company and his legacy.On the call, Mr Chapek said he thought the cruise ship business, which has been at the epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, could also rebound in the long term. He said Disney\u0027s lines will be “much more resilient” than competitors and noted that “consumers trust our business to react in a responsible way to protect them”.For now, though, the numbers are bleak, and may get bleaker. Disney\u0027s film studio saw an operating income drop of about 8 per cent, to $466m\u0026nbsp(£375m), as the company was unable to release its much anticipated Mulan\u0026nbspat the end of March. That film has been postponed until the end of July. The effect of other postponed spring releases, such as Marvel picture Black Widow, will be felt in the new quarter. The movie has been postponed from May to November.There is no timetable for the playing of NBA and Major League Baseball games that drive viewership to ESPN.The earnings figures preview a potentially dramatic fall for a company that just a few months ago had an iron grip on the entertainment industry. Disney closed 2019 with all five of the highest-grossing movies in the world and more than $20bn\u0026nbsp(£16bn) in revenue for the quarter ending 31 December, a 36 per cent increase from the previous year. Parks alone generated more than $7bn\u0026nbsp(£5.6bn) in revenue and $2bn (£1.6bn) in profit.Disney was facing some challenges, including cord-cutting and a potential slowdown in theatrical revenue, before coronavirus hit. But the pandemic has slammed nearly all of its key isions.The cruise-ship and theme-park unit, which Mr\u0026nbspChapek\u0026nbspoversaw until recently, accounted for nearly 40 per cent of Disney\u0027s overall revenue last year.Though there is no timetable for the reopenings of US\u0026nbspparks, Mr\u0026nbspChapek suggested that the company would go slowly, and also not reopen if executives were not confident visitors would follow.“We would not reopen any park until we can make a positive contribution to overhead and operating-profit level,” he said.Mr Chapek did say that Shanghai Disneyland will open on Monday. He said contact tracing, social-distancing and “early detection systems” will be among the tools used to limit virus exposure. Masks will be given to staff and guests, he said.The opening will serve as a test case for potential US\u0026nbspreopenings in Florida and California, particularly on the issue of capacity. The Chinese government is mandating about 30 per cent capacity, or 24,000 of the roughly 80,000 people who visit the park daily. The first few weeks will see Disney cap the number at below even that, Mr Chapek said, as staffers work out the new protocols.Demi Lovato recalls how eating disorder impacted her on Disney showDisney heiress criticises CEO’s for furloughing staffFlorida Disney World to furlough 43,000 workersDisney has furloughed as many as 100,000 employees beginning in April. Executives have said they will accept cuts in their own compensation. Mr Chapek says he had no timetable on the furloughed employees return. The senior-executive salary cut will continue “until we see a substantive economic recovery”.Disney Plus has been a bright spot for the firm amid the pandemic, with 50 million global sign-ups as of early April. Still, the company does not expect profitability from the service for at least three years. The service is also affected by production shutdowns, limiting its ability to churn out new shows that will attract and retain subscribers.Executives said that they still planned on opening Mulan\u0026nbspin theaters at the end of July, and would have the benefit of what Mr Chapek called a “competitive movie” - Warner Bros\u0027s\u0026nbspTenet\u0026nbsp- opening the week before to see how consumers react. At that point, however, it would likely be too late to change release plans.Disney chief financial officer Christine McCarthy declined to offer definitive comment on any shareholder idend in 2020, saying only there was none planned at the moment and the company will address the matter again “in the next six months”. The company has provided a idend in recent years as its stock price has risen.Disney\u0027s share price has dropped about 10 per cent since the US\u0026nbspclosures due to coronavirus became probable the second week of March. The stock dropped 2 per cent in after-hours trading Tuesday with the earnings news.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, it said more normal shopping patterns have returned in recent weeks.In an attempt minimise the risk of spreading Covid-19, Ocado has introduced contact-free deliveries, temperature monitoring for staff, and regular testing of frontline workers.The sales update came as Ocado prepared to face anger at its annual meeting over chief executive Tim Steiner\u0027s £58.7m pay deal for last year.Ocado isn\u0027t the only grocer enjoying bumper sales. Consumers are making fewer trips to the shops but are spending more when they do venture out, according to data from analysts Kantar. Grocery sales in Britain rose by 5.5 per cent year-on-year in the four weeks to 19 April, Kantar said.Ocado said it expects the long-term shift towards online grocery to accelerate post-crisis but said it is unable to provide guidance for its outlook for the rest of the year due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.Mr Steiner said: We are facing quite a different challenge to many, as we scale up Ocado to play its part in feeding the nation, and as we help our clients launch and roll out their online businesses more rapidly against a backdrop of a likely long-term increase in demand for online.Ocado remains in a strong position and, while we should be grateful that our current challenges are around growth, expansion and increased demand, we have great empathy for all who are facing different challenges at this time.In retail, we are working with our small suppliers to make sure we pay them earlier than normal and we will work closely with any who are struggling.Ocado\u0027s 40 per cent sales jump added to a 10 per cent increase in the first quarter of its financial year.

Parks and cruises had profit go from $1.5bn (£1.2bn)\u0026nbspin the quarter last year to $639m\u0026nbsp(£514m) this year, with a loss of about $1bn in revenue.Earnings-per-share, meanwhile, dropped to just 60 cents, a 63 per cent decline compared to the same quarter a year ago and lower than the 89 cents many forecasters expected.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThose reduced numbers were cushioned by the fact that much of the quarter played out before the crisis hit in the US, and many analysts and investors believe the worse is yet to come. The quarter, for instance, included only a few weeks of the park shutdowns in the US.And team sports, on which Disney cable network ESPN heavily relies, were not suspended until about the same time. The company currently lacks a wide range of revenue streams for the new quarter, which runs through June there is no timetable, for instance, on the reopening of US\u0026nbsptheme parks.Created with Sketch.The 25 most anticipated movies and TV shows on Disney+ Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This $100m series created by Jon Favreau is one of six originals teased by Disney for the launch of the streaming platform (with more to come in the future).

Enough said.“Today\u0027s not the point,” said Lloyd Greif, a veteran Los Angeles-based investment banker who closely follows Disney. “We haven\u0027t seen ugly yet. Third and fourth quarter is where the rubber will really hit the road.”Disney\u0027s executives had few answers for analysts on what they could do to stem the tide until the American entertainment economy can resume at anything close to full capacity. They pointed to few scattered revenue-drivers, such as high ratings for its ESPN documentary series\u0026nbspThe Last Dance\u0026nbspand growing subscriptions for Disney Plus, as a way of keeping dollars flowing.Instead, executives sought to paint a longer-term picture that relied on more general advantages like the trustworthiness of the Disney brand.“As someone who\u0027s been around for a while and led the company through some really tough days\u0026nbsp... I have absolute confidence we\u0027ll get through this challenging period and recover successfully,” Bob Iger, the company\u0027s executive chairman and until several months ago its chief executive, told analysts in a call.He said he thought it “quite possible” Disney\u0027s properties will now resonate with consumers more than ever. “People find comfort and inspiration in our messages of hope and optimism,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWhy have share prices been rising while economies have been tanking?Mr Iger, the often-celebrated chief executive who stepped down shortly before the crisis erupted in the US\u0026nbspto focus on content, has retaken more of a public role from successor Bob Chapek as he tries to right the company and his legacy.On the call, Mr Chapek said he thought the cruise ship business, which has been at the epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, could also rebound in the long term. He said Disney\u0027s lines will be “much more resilient” than competitors and noted that “consumers trust our business to react in a responsible way to protect them”.For now, though, the numbers are bleak, and may get bleaker. Disney\u0027s film studio saw an operating income drop of about 8 per cent, to $466m\u0026nbsp(£375m), as the company was unable to release its much anticipated Mulan\u0026nbspat the end of March. That film has been postponed until the end of July. The effect of other postponed spring releases, such as Marvel picture Black Widow, will be felt in the new quarter. The movie has been postponed from May to November.There is no timetable for the playing of NBA and Major League Baseball games that drive viewership to ESPN.The earnings figures preview a potentially dramatic fall for a company that just a few months ago had an iron grip on the entertainment industry. Disney closed 2019 with all five of the highest-grossing movies in the world and more than $20bn\u0026nbsp(£16bn) in revenue for the quarter ending 31 December, a 36 per cent increase from the previous year. Parks alone generated more than $7bn\u0026nbsp(£5.6bn) in revenue and $2bn (£1.6bn) in profit.Disney was facing some challenges, including cord-cutting and a potential slowdown in theatrical revenue, before coronavirus hit. But the pandemic has slammed nearly all of its key isions.The cruise-ship and theme-park unit, which Mr\u0026nbspChapek\u0026nbspoversaw until recently, accounted for nearly 40 per cent of Disney\u0027s overall revenue last year.Though there is no timetable for the reopenings of US\u0026nbspparks, Mr\u0026nbspChapek suggested that the company would go slowly, and also not reopen if executives were not confident visitors would follow.“We would not reopen any park until we can make a positive contribution to overhead and operating-profit level,” he said.Mr Chapek did say that Shanghai Disneyland will open on Monday. He said contact tracing, social-distancing and “early detection systems” will be among the tools used to limit virus exposure. Masks will be given to staff and guests, he said.The opening will serve as a test case for potential US\u0026nbspreopenings in Florida and California, particularly on the issue of capacity. The Chinese government is mandating about 30 per cent capacity, or 24,000 of the roughly 80,000 people who visit the park daily. The first few weeks will see Disney cap the number at below even that, Mr Chapek said, as staffers work out the new protocols.Demi Lovato recalls how eating disorder impacted her on Disney showDisney heiress criticises CEO’s for furloughing staffFlorida Disney World to furlough 43,000 workersDisney has furloughed as many as 100,000 employees beginning in April. Executives have said they will accept cuts in their own compensation. Mr Chapek says he had no timetable on the furloughed employees return. The senior-executive salary cut will continue “until we see a substantive economic recovery”.Disney Plus has been a bright spot for the firm amid the pandemic, with 50 million global sign-ups as of early April. Still, the company does not expect profitability from the service for at least three years. The service is also affected by production shutdowns, limiting its ability to churn out new shows that will attract and retain subscribers.Executives said that they still planned on opening Mulan\u0026nbspin theaters at the end of July, and would have the benefit of what Mr Chapek called a “competitive movie” - Warner Bros\u0027s\u0026nbspTenet\u0026nbsp- opening the week before to see how consumers react. At that point, however, it would likely be too late to change release plans.Disney chief financial officer Christine McCarthy declined to offer definitive comment on any shareholder idend in 2020, saying only there was none planned at the moment and the company will address the matter again “in the next six months”. The company has provided a idend in recent years as its stock price has risen.Disney\u0027s share price has dropped about 10 per cent since the US\u0026nbspclosures due to coronavirus became probable the second week of March. The stock dropped 2 per cent in after-hours trading Tuesday with the earnings news.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And while most of us are encountering the many difficulties that accompany a global pandemic, the Covid-19 crisis has thrown the good deeds of British public into sharp relief.As the UK works together to stay home, the power of kindness, generosity and goodwill have proved triumphant over the last few months: with thousands offering help and resource to the vulnerable, home-cooked food to workers on the frontline and much-needed emotional support systems to the isolated. Here, we talk to five inspirational people making a difference…Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPhil Jones: the Chester-based chef cooking and delivering hundreds of meals each weekAfter being furloughed from his job as a chef, Chester-based Phil Jones (pictured above) decided to take the opportunity to practise his skills in the kitchen, watching YouTube videos to keep up with the younger colleagues who sometimes consider him old-fashioned.It wasn’t long before Phil realised he had a lot of food, so he decided to get in touch with some of his vulnerable neighbours. Soon, word spread and Phil heard about more and more people in need. He posted on some local groups, and things began to snowball. Now, the 40-year-old volunteer is waking up around 6:30 each morning to prepare, cook and deliver around 40 meals per day to local residents and NHS staff at the nearby hospital, the Countess of Chester. Sometimes, he doesn’t stop until 11 o’clock at night.“It’s strange really, because I get up and I step into the kitchen and just the thought of making people happy is just a massive buzz and it outweighs the tiredness,” he notes. “For someone to come along and bring some home-cooked food, it’s like winning the lottery for them – that’s what a couple of them have said.”Prav​ashini\u0026nbspRamsamy: the recent mum helping dozens of local families“I was completely devastated by the news,” says Pravashini Ramsamy on hearing that elderly and vulnerable people, as well as key workers, were struggling to access groceries.So the mother of three, who hadn’t yet returned to work as a training manager after maternity leave, set up the local community group Finchley COVID 19 on Facebook.Of the group’s 218 members, there are around 70 local volunteers who have helped 60 isolating iniduals and families, delivering shopping, home-cooked meals and running essential errands.Living in East Finchley with her fiancé\u0026nbspand children, Pravashini, 40, coordinates the volunteers and takes referrals from Barnet and Brent councils to help people at risk.They also serve local key workers. With the help of the local Indian restaurant Majjo’s, they deliver lunch to the Whittington Hospital’s midwife team every Tuesday, and upwards of 70 cooked meals to the police station in Wood Green on a Wednesday.“Our volunteers don’t know these families and go to them, and the families don’t know our volunteers and trust them, and that is so powerful. It’s almost like a salary – it’s the reward.”Frank Charles: the inspirational Londoner running a foodbank from homeAlongside a yearly appeal to help provide ill children with Christmas presents, Frank Charles also runs Feed the Streetz, a community project providing breakfast to rough sleepers. And since the pandemic has hit, the East Londoner has transformed his own home into a foodbank of sorts.Delivering PPE, food and little luxuries to the staff at Whipps Cross Hospital – where all three of his sons were born – Frank is responding to calls for aid to vulnerable families, GOSH, and care homes across East London. “I’d do it anyway, it’s in my DNA.”Discover more hereIan Alcorn: the Nottingham-based dad-of-four who has helped raise £160,000 through garden campoutsNottingham-based bathroom fitter and dad-of-two Ian Alcorn had two goals: he wanted to support the NHS and to keep his children occupied. And so the Great British Campout was born, a JustGiving page that encouraged people to camp out in their back garden and to donate to £2 to NHS Charities together. He’d never have thought that just several weeks later, the initiative would have raised £160,000 from participants across the globe.He now plans to host campouts worldwide over the May bank holiday weekends, in a bid to raise the total funds to half-a-million-pounds to support NHS workers on the front line of the Coronavirus pandemic.The support has poured in and Ian has been humbled by all the praise and thanks from NHS workers. “But I’m not the one wearing a cape – it’s just an idea come good. They are the ones I want to thank and that’s the whole reason this came about.”Discover more hereMichelle Rosewell: the Bexleyheath resident taking hundreds of calls from the area\u0027s most vulnerableIt was mid-March when mother-of-four Michelle Rosewell asked her Facebook contacts if they knew any local organisations who needed help. The Bexleyheath resident wanted to get involved, but wasn’t sure how.She then met Fiona Thompson on the Nextdoor website. And they became two of Isolation Help Bexley’s founding members, along with Dave Paul, Eugene Petzer, Liz Millmore and Colin Harrison.Michelle recounts a conversation with a local resident who had neither the cash nor means to get the essentials she needed. A box was packed for her and when she opened it she saw some flowers. “Her and her mum burst out crying, phoned me back and said ‘it’s made our day.’“It’s definitely brought people together, and I think things will change,” suggests Michelle. “They’ve changed already.”Discover more hereWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Today, through a partnership with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), we launched a new on-service prompt in the UK that will direct people to a Government webpage with credible, factual and verified information relating to 5G.“Our partnerships throughout this pandemic, have allowed us to take proactive steps in bringing people the information most relevant, and useful for them and we\u0027re happy to add this update today, in collaboration with DCMS in the UK.\u0027\u0027Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden also said: “We have set up a new counter disinformation unit and are working with the social media platforms to make sure the public has access to reliable information during the coronavirus crisis and to give us a much better picture of where disinformation is spreading. This move by Twitter directing users to official Government advice is a step in the right direction as part of this work.“Twitter is not the only social media platform to be taking action against coronavirus and 5G misinformation.

Many of those who share, or seek, conspiracy theories linking 5G and the coronavirus are unlikely to trust the government, and as such as fact-checking provided the government may not convince them.5G is in no way related to the coronavirus. The coronavirus has spread in countries that do not yet have 5G connectivity such as Iran and Malaysia. Moreover, 5G signals in the UK are built over the existing 4G signals that have existed in the country for nearly a decade, which did not cause a major pandemic.Wired reports that the conspiracy theory originated from a “scientifically-baseless claim” that spread through Facebook groups and via YouTube videos. It has since been spread by numerous celebrities to audiences of millions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government keeps saying this pandemic is a war – well, we were being killed.”At least 28 drivers in the capital have died after being diagnosed with Covid-19. Figures for the rest of the country are difficult to confirm but it seems likely at least another dozen have similarly succumbed.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTogether, they were young and old, veterans and relative newcomers, and from a range of\u0026nbspbackgrounds. Some had underlying health conditions. One, Martin Egan, a driver in Bristol, had not taken a day off sick in more than six years.But what they all had in common was that, as Covid-19 swept the country in late February and early March – as it became clear the simple act of sharing an enclosed space with others was a health hazard – they kept driving. They kept turning up to do their job – because if they did not, says Murphy, “no one else would get to work either”.Teachers, he points out, “would not get to schools nurses wouldn’t get to hospitals”.NHS Nightingale hospital to stop admitting patients this week, leaked Suspend rent to help workers at risk of job loss, think tank saysBoris Johnson ‘thought it was over’, Trump saysCameron Mackintosh says theatres ‘unlikely’ to reopen this yearClarke fears fans unlikely to return to sport ‘any time soon’Staggered work times expected as part of UK lockdown exit strategyAs the country continues to wrestle with the coronavirus crisis, certain professions have stepped up to be counted in a way that has been a privilege to witness. NHS staff, delivery drivers and supermarket assistants have all shown themselves to be among a new backbone of Britain.And key among these key workers have been bus drivers and transport workers.In many ways, they have found themselves on something approximate to a front line. “But you carry on because, what’s drummed into you, is that it’s you who keeps the country moving,” says Murphy, a driver in London of 25 years before he took up his current post with Unite. “Whatever happens – terror attack, disaster, pandemic – it’s your duty to carry on.”Graham Vidler, chief executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, puts it another way: “Without all those working in the bus industry, the emergency network for key workers would grind to a halt.”Such workers have done all this, it’s worth adding, despite measures to protect their safety often being slow and limited.

It runs less now than it did six weeks ago. But, amid the collapsing economies and rising death figures on TV and the empty streets outside, its presence once every hour or so is a reassuring reminder that some normality still exists.The world is in crisis, perhaps, but you can still catch a First South Yorkshire from Lodge Moor up to Charnock.“It’s lovely to know you can have that effect on people just by driving your bus,” says Rebecca Holt, a staffer with Nottingham City Transport which runs 50 services a day in the East Midlands city. “People have told me what we’re doing is inspiring but it’s just my job. It’s actually quite nice having quiet roads for once.”All the same, she realised just how much she was impressing others when a van driver flashed her through a junction last week.“There were two of them in the cab,” she says. “And, as I passed through, they started clapping me. I was just like, ‘Oh wow’. I felt like royalty.”The 45-year-old is one of 173 of NCT’s 850 drivers still currently on the roads.Since the lockdown, passenger numbers have fallen across the country to around 15 per cent of pre-crisis levels. Services have been reduced accordingly with resources redirected to routes connecting high population areas to key infrastructure such as hospitals and major supermarkets.As a result, an estimated 80 per cent of the country’s 95,000 drivers have been furloughed. Stagecoach, the country’s biggest provider, has placed 55 per cent of its drivers and engineers on the government scheme.Yet the fact that many such workers were apparently willing to carry on – indeed, did carry on pre-lockdown even as infection rates soared amongst colleagues – is a sign, it might be suggested, of an unrecognised sort of heroism.“I wouldn’t call myself that,” demurs Holt, a mother-of-one who has been in what she calls her “dream job” for four years.Why did she volunteer to keep driving then, I wonder? She’s not entirely sure. Financially, she says, she would have been happy enough to take a temporary 20 per cent pay cut and have the time off.But? “I wanted to do something. I’m not a nurse. I can’t help people if they’re sick.

Her husband Dave, a fellow staffer, went on furlough to look after their two sons but she continued in her cab.“Perhaps I’m blase about the risks,” she says. “But this is my town and I wanted to carry on serving it.”Was she not worried, given the disproportionate number of drivers losing their lives, for her own heath? “Every time you hear of another driver like that, it’s devastating,” she says. “You can’t help but think about if it could happen to you. But you do what you can to stay safe and hope you’ll be OK.”She\u0026nbspherself is happy with measures taken by companies to protect their drivers.Most are, by all accounts, now being provided with hand sanitiser and antibacterial wipes, and vehicles are deep-cleaned once a day. In London, after a concerted campaign, only the middle doors are being opened to the public. Elsewhere, holes in the plastic cab screens – which allowed drivers to better hear customers – have been filed in.“We used to call them bandit screens,” says Russell. “Now, they’re known as virus screens.”Yet, equally, there have been questions raised over whether companies – and the government – acted quickly enough.Many safety measures were not introduced until post-lockdown – when many drivers had already fallen ill with Covid-19 – while there is still no PPE provided as standard. Calls to require customers to wear face masks have gone unheeded. When some drivers blocked off the first two rows of seats on their vehicles – essentially to ensure passengers were keeping their distance – a manager at Arriva threatened disciplinary action. The company later apologised.“Safety measures are starting to appear now,” says Murphy, of Unite, again. “But if you go back to the war analogy, the enemy would have been at Hadrian’s Wall while we were still discussing defences. It was too slow, and it still doesn’t go far enough.”The union is now calling for the £60,000 life assurance payment promised to families of NHS workers who die with coronavirus to be applied to bus drivers too.“We accept that NHS staff and social care staff are in the highest category of risk,” says Bobby Morton, national officer for passenger transport. “But other key workers should be not be forgotten if the worst unfortunately happens.“What we have discovered about coronavirus is that it is an indiscriminate killer that has been responsible for the deaths of far too many bus workers who are classed as key workers, keeping the country running during this national emergency.”Back in Nottingham, it is something that Holt believes is a reasonable request – but she also has another somewhat simpler hope.“I’ve been getting more people say thank you when they get off than I’ve ever known before,” she says. “It’s lovely to hear that, it makes you feel appreciated. When all this is over, I hope that carries on.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They may have been getting by before coronavirus hit, and school would be a really important part of that, but not being in school intensifies the risk.“All the local authorities I talk to say they’re expecting and planning for a surge in referrals once schools go back. But of course, that means there will be children now who need that help, which is why during this period and as children start to return to school, it’s really important that the schools and local authorities have the bandwidth and resources behind them to try and identify where those vulnerable children are.Judith Blake, chair of the Local Government Association’s children and young people board, said councils were “very concerned” about falling referrals to children’s social care and warned\u0026nbspit was “vital” they receive funding needed to support children and families both during the current phase of the crisis and\u0026nbspthe recovery period.“Councils are working with their partners and communities to try to identify children who may be at risk, and putting in place plans so that if referrals spike when children return to school, they are able to ensure children and families get the right help quickly,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We are certainly not all in this together.”The Children’s Commissioner warned\u0026nbsphundreds of thousands of pupils were also at a “complete disadvantage” due to not having access to a device on which to take part in online classes, which she said would place many at risk of never catching up, and “hugely exacerbate” the current attainment gap in schools.A third of pupils have taken part in online lessons during the coronavirus lockdown, with the figure differing considerably in different schools, accounting for around 57 per cent of privately educated children\u0026nbspand around 19 per cent in state schools. Around 700,000 children are currently without access to a laptop or a tablet in their homes and 60,000 do not have broadband.In mid-April, the education secretary Gavin Williamson\u0026nbspannounced\u0026nbspa scheme to provide laptops and tablets\u0026nbspto disadvantaged pupils to make remote education accessible during the lockdown, but Ms Longfield said this was not set to be fully in place until the end of May, leaving many children with “another month without anything”.“I’m very worried about the children already educational disadvantaged for whom this will have been a period where they’ve fallen even further behind and potentially may never catch up if they aren’t given the support they need,” she said.“We know that over the summer there’s an established understanding of learning loss for that six weeks, but for six months that\u0027s something that really starts to have a huge impact on the prospects of the child. We know poorer kids are about 18 months behind anyway, and that ide is likely to be exacerbated hugely because of this.”She called on central government to provide schools with additional funding to introduce some form of “catch-up programme” to help disadvantaged pupils return to the point they should be at academically, and for the challenge facing teachers to be recognised.The commissioner said this, along with ensuring local authorities are prepared for a surge in child protection referrals, was essential to make sure hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged\u0026nbspchildren are not negatively impacted by the lockdown for years to come.“When I speak to some of the councils in areas already struggling economically, they’ve been saying it’s not just about now, it’s about what’s coming,” she added.“What many children are experiencing now will have long-term impact, both in terms of the trauma and anxiety, and for those who have educational disadvantage, and the fact that they will need so much more support to be able to re-enter learning in any real way.“We know the economy is going to be struggling in future. These children need every resource they can have at their disposal to be able to be resilient to what’s coming down the track as they grow up and set out on the world. One of the huge challenges for school and social services is being able to reach out to those families and keep in contact, and identify them in the first place.”The government has been approached for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Los Angeles, US, 700 food packages will go to homeless military veterans. Other projects are in India and Ethiopia.How we treat animals ‘still risking spreading disease’Naomi Hallum, director of the organisation, which is funded by donations, said: “We hope that the $100,000 of food we are giving will help relieve some of the suffering caused by Covid-19, but the real value of our work lies in education, in telling people how and why these pandemics emerge, in showing the destruction caused to our planet and our bodies when we eat animal products.“The coronavirus pandemic, like many others before it, is creating tragedies for families all over the world.

I think she might do well to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary\u0027s book in terms of tone.“I’m afraid what she said is not true. There’s been a rapid acceleration of testing offer the last few months in this country, including getting to 100,000 tests a day.“We’ve been entirely transparent on the way that that has been measured throughout, and I have confidence that the rate will continue to rise.“Currently capacity is 108,000 a day, and we are working to build that higher.“Of course, we’ve been working very hard to make the testing capacity grow as fast as possible and as more tests are available so we are able to make them available\u0026nbsp to more people and test people right across the NHS.”The prime minister\u0027s official spokesman later said: It may be at the moment there is less demand for tests from key workers because the infection rate is stablising or falling. I would hope everyone can agree that that is a good thing. If fewer people are going into hospital with coronavirus symptoms that will mean fewer tests need to be carried out in NHS setting. Likewise, if there\u0027s less community transmission, it will mean that key workers potentially need fewer tests. That shouldn\u0027t be seen as a bad thing.The key point is capacity has been really significantly increased. We can now do more than 100,000 tests a day and as we move forward into the next phase, including the rollout of \u0027trace, track and test\u0027, we have the capacity we need.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Gig workers have sought health care coverage and sick pay, along with programmes such as workers\u0027 compensation to bring them in line with those doing similarly rigorous work.Mr Becerra said any action would be predicated on making sure Uber and Lyft “play by the rules”.“They take the workers\u0027 labour, but they won\u0027t accept the worker protections-so taxpayers end up having to help carry the load,” he said in a statement posted to Twitter.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Because the UK is still so far behind Spain and until you have it contained, people won’t be allowed to come and have their week in Benidorm.The Balearic Islands have issued similar sentiments, with Tourism minister Iago Negueruela adding: There are countries like the United Kingdom that have taken too long to adopt containment measures and that also puts us in a dferent situation with respect to them.Some of the Greek islands, including Santorini, Crete and Kos, are yet to report any cases of coronavirus.Despite this, tourism is not expected toto the country just yet, with the flight ban being extended until mid-May.On the bright side, lockdown measures are beginning to ease and tourists could be welcomed back by Julythe virus continues to slow.Turkey is looking to resume flights by mid-May although these will be just domestic routes initially.The countrys culture and tourism minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy said: Hopefully, we will see that tourism activities will start again during the Ramadan Feast.The Ramadan Feast, also known as Eid ul-Fitr, will be celebrated at the end of May.He added that he expected flight schedules toto normal by the end of June, with air travel likely to start with Asia, followed by Russia, the Balkans and then Europe.Tourists are also likely to need health certicates proving they dont have coronavirus to be allowed into the country.Seamus McCauley at Holiday Extras explained that booking in the future isnt necessarily a bad thing to consider, thanks to new flexible change policies.He told Sun Online Travel: Airlines are bringing forward their   winter schedule so people can book to fly then.That’s sensible for customers who are looking ahead to the end of the current crisis, and good for everyone to have something to look forward to evenit’s towards the end of the year.However, he added: But like most travel businesses we appreciate that people are cautious about making plans until the situation resolves, so we’re glad to see so much flexibility and forward-planning in our industry. Caution is still advised, with the unprecedented pandemic meaning travel rules and restrictions could change at the last minute.The current advice from the government is to avoid all non-essential travel indefinitely, with no date put forward on when domestic or overseas trips can resume.Any further information on when holidays are to be expected could change at the last minute, with experts and tour operators unable to say for definite when trips will resume - especiallycoronavirus cases surge.UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned that he wouldnt be booking a summer holiday at this point due to the virus continuing to spread.A trip abroad for the summer may not be out of the question, however.Flights in April and May have all but been cancelled, excluding repatriation flights.But airlines are expecting to resume their normal flights ahead of the peak July and August season.Both Jet and Ryanair hope to restart flights in June, while easyJet has launched holidays for late .Experts have said that a trip in the next three months could be on the cards, although this is likely to be for UK holidays only.A spokesperson for Aito, the Association of Independent Tour Operators, told the Express: If luck is on our side, then three months hence should see things calm down on the virus front.It’s likely that the first travellers within the UK will venture out again to explore their own country at the traditional start of the summer season.However, it can also depend on each country, with destinations across Europe facing much stricter lockdowns due to coronavirus.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many studies show women are more focused on building community and teams.They are more likely than men to cultivate a erse set of advisers to help them succeed. They are also more likely to follow advice.A study by management consulting firm McKinsey found that women are more people- orientated and spend more time developing and coaching other leaders in their organisation. In other words, they don’t need to reserve all the glory for themselves.There is something  at play too, though. Female leaders are more likely to be blameddecisions are unpopular or ineffective. They are questioned and second-guessed more often than men.But then Covid- entered the equation and presented world leaders with a new challenge — an invisible enemy that is highly contagious, unpredictable and deadly.This pandemic has been an unprecedented test for all concerned.And guess what  A disproportionate number of those who have passed this test — countries such as Germany, New Zealand, Iceland and Finland — have women at the helm.It is not exclusively female-led countries that are doing well, of course. But bearing in mind only seven per cent of all world leaders are women, about  per cent of countries led by women are doing well when it comes to containing Covid-. Global health experts have concluded that one thing that has led to success in tackling coronavirus is — speed.Prof Tom Bollyky, director of global health programme at US think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “Countries that have not dithered in their response, that have mobilised quickly, have done well.”New Zealand’s PM Jacinda Ardern put it simply: “Go hard and go early.”The number of Covid--related deaths is predicted to be substantially lower in areas where leaders acted sooner, even by a week, because they flattened the curve and prevented new cases.Many women acted first and made the brave decision to shut down le as we knew it, even though that was an unpopular thing to do.But it seems women leaders are listening to World Health Organisation advice and also looking at other countries for guidance.They don’t think they have all the answers but women are able to put their ego to one side and let experts guide them — something which cannot be said of Donald Trump.Incidentally, I have not seen any women leaders making unfounded or dangerous suggestions about possible cures. Can you imagine a woman leader suggesting that people inject Dettol into themselves, as dingbat Trump recently suggested Or can you imagine a woman suggesting to people that they can fight coronavirus and winthey are strong enough This pandemic is not a battle to be fought and won. It is a virus, which can affect literally anyone.No one knows how they will be affected and that bullish “fight it” approach is, in my experience, very male. Conversely, the decision to protect everyone, putting the most at risk first, is more female.It’s interesting that some male leaders seem more interested in covering up the problems. Like Donald Trump, who thinks he is an expert on everything and more fixated on garnering praise for what he has done than fixing and getting right what has not gone so well.I know I am talking in generalisations here but my experience of women is that we want to understand the mistakes and fix them, not cover them up.This pandemic has been full of dficulty and tragedy for everyone.But perhaps one good thing that will come out of it is that the world will acknowledge women deserve an equal  when it comes to leadership.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

In fact, it’s unrecognisable after just six weeks of lockdown.The images show how the usually murky waters of the UK coastline have been transformed, which must surely be due in part to a reduction in pollution since the coronavirus pandemic stopped leisure traffic on the Solent.But other astonishing photos from all over the world have surfaced recently too.Pollution-free images of landmarks in Delhi and Beijing, which are all too often seen shimmering under a haze of smog, are a real reminder of our role in creating pollution and also in reducing it.Imagineanother silver lining to this terrible pandemic was that we all began to understand the effects of our impact on the environment, and that we took the threat of climate change more seriously – and started to take responsibility for changing our ways.I AM as keen as the next person to regain my freedom, and for things to begin toto normal.But I cannot be the only one who gave a shudder at the thought of being allowed to choose a “bubble” of just ten family members as friends, as was hinted at by some.Can you even imagine the disputes, upsets and hurt feelings that would result all over the landyour chosen bubble had chosen another group to huddle with In fact, that rule would likely cause so much offence that we would only have ten friends left. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

British journalism, in particular.What’s stopping you right now from falling off your perch in fits of laughter  Well, the fact that you’re currently digesting a work of journalism.This probably means that it’s an act – let’s call it that for now – which you’re used to committing on a fairly regular basis.Let’s also assume then that much of the information you gather, store and share comes from such journalistic sources.It’s likely you frequently form opinions and make decisions based on this content you consume.In fact, think really hard for a moment and try and imagine an area of your le where you haven’t been guided in some form by journalism.Buying a house, investing your savings, choosing a school, picking a holiday, deciding which box to put your cross in when you go into a polling booth .If you’re honest with yourself, you tend to make most of those decisions after you’ve digested the array of journalism available to you. And let’s also admit, disregarded too.Some of it is opinion led, some is impartial. You might not agree with all of it, and sometimes you might get ruddy cross at a paper or commentator that doesn’t chime with your world view.But together, the many erse components of British journalism create something which is profoundly valuable.The Covid- pandemic has tested our society to the limit. In the midst of a national crisis, journalists have been putting their lives at risk to keep you informed.News outlets have faithfully broadcast public health announcements – but also held our political leaders to account.The Downing Street daily conference has become a household staple, with ministerial interrogation by the press corps regularly influencing government policy.Without such probing questions and front page splashes, would you have known about the dearth of PPE or the crisis in our care homes Journalism, from local to national level, has connected communities in a way that social networks can only dream of. We have celebrated triumph in the face of adversity – and also documented tributes from the tens of thousands who have lost loved ones.But now we come to the rub.With the country under lockdown, British journalism is facing the biggest threat in its storied history.For newspapers, sales have dramatically fallen. For broadcasters and online outlets, advertising has gone through the floor even whilst audience numbers have risen.Yes, journalism joins one of many industries in financial peril right now.The work of reporters should be held up to scrutiny like any other profession. But we also need to acknowledge the sacrices its practitioners are making to keep the public informed.Everything that journalism hands to you doesn’t come for free.I’m sure that when you think about this properly, in a way you might never have done before, it really is needed more than everWe have to safeguard journalism. It is far too important to discard because it isn’t worth contemplating what the world would look likequality journalism didn’t exist.I don’t need to urge you to buy a paper or take up an online subscription, but I want you to tell everyone you meet that our sector is under a very real and present threat.I am the CEO of the Journalists’ Charity. It was founded in  by Charles Dickens and a group of parliamentary reporters – naturally in a pub.Our core mission to this day remains the same: to bring aid to journalists and their dependents who have fallen on hard times.We are stepping up to the mark, helping those in need with emergency funding and practical and emotional support.It’s why we’ve launched a #supportjournalism campaign in print and on social media.For me, a lockdown without journalists would be unthinkable.That’s why the Journalists’ Charity is standing four-square behind our industry when it needs us most. But we also need you to do your bit too.The Journalists’ Charity has been helping journalists through tough times for more than  years.

He’s just Jamie Oliver with a skipping rope, I assumed, before this wretched lockdown business began.A character we’ve all seen in our local park, with a pair of boxing gloves and a stopwatch, charging financial managers £ a haemorrhoid to do some sit-ups over by the ornamental lake.One of Britain’s ever-growing army of personal trainers who,he wasn’t bouncing around on YouTube every morning, would be clogging up Love Island or Ex On The Beach.That’s what I thought, anyway.Then the coronavirus hit, the local swimming pool shut, the man became a phenomenon and before I could come to my senses, Joe and his infernal timing device were beeping away in my living room, every morning, as I joined in his PE lesson. Inevitably, it didn’t last.First, Joe’s routine did me what I can only describe as “a mischief”.Then, one morning, aged , I caught sight of myself, in a picture frame, doing his “reverse frog shuffle” and thought: “Stuff this for type two diabetes. I’m out.”I’d got no closer to understanding Joe’s astonishing popularity, though, which is truly global.Over , people log in just to stare at his fairly spartan living room, every Monday to Friday.Hundreds of thousands more appear when Joe starts his  minutes of physical jerks.So, in an attempt to unlock the greatest mystery of the outbreak, I kept watching Joe and swtly came to the conclusion success was not linked to his presenting skills.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Nah, only joking.”The jokes need to go the same way as the viewers’ poems, in honour of Joe, which he was actually reading out loud, until modesty finally prevailed.Much safer ground is the “spot the dference” competition, which borders on insulting, when he’s merely placed his wall atlas upside down or swapped his electric guitar for a ukulele, but does hint at the drive, ambition and ego behind the man.One day he replaced the atlas with a picture of himself, the next with a picture of his “other house” in Los Angeles and suddenly the penny dropped.Joe’s loaded and his head is not just on its way to Hollywood, it’s already there, making movies and doing squat thrusts with Gwyneth and Brad.The weird thing is, in other presenters, soap actors or comedians, I’d roll my eyes at the folly.With Joe Wicks, I don’t. ’Cos I can’t help it, I quite like him.Part of that may be linked to his no-frills background and a level of personal generosity that’s way beyond most of us .But I like to think it’s got more to do with the fact that, at a time when other cynical, doom-mongering TV hosts are desperately trying to read the public mood, reinvent themselves and force their agenda on viewers, Joe Wicks is just doing what he’s always done.

It wasnt wrong though.Not sure whether it suits us to go along with it or not, but these two are not the same.But the Daily Mail reports the photos Ms Mench shared appear to be crudely doctored.And, to add to the mystery, the claims come as the North Korean leader missed yet another high-profile event.He was noticeably absent as Russia awarded him a medal to mark the th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany.Human rights activist Jenner Zeng was the first to draw attention to dferences in the new Kim, reports IBT.“Is the Kim Jong-un appearing on May  the real one ” she asked on Twitter along with side-by-side comparisons of Kim’s “old and new” appearances in two posts.Another user pointed out that Kim looked slightly dferent during his recent appearance.My theory is either that he died and was replaced by a clone lookalike, or was out of the public eye for so long bc he was recovering from plastic surgery, tweeted anotherHis nose seems a little bit more rounded, his hairline looks wider, and he used to have WAY more wrinkles around the eyes when he smiled, the poster added.The hairline may just be receding or a fresh new haircut, but the smoother eyes and slightly dferent nose have me questioning things.The North Korean despot suddenly reappeared at a fertiliser factory on Friday after vanishing for nearly three weeks sparking claims he had died or was in a coma after a botched op.He appeared alongside his sister Kim Yo-jong, who had been tipped to succeed him, at the fertiliser plant, the pictures claim to show.Concern over his health began when he failed to appear at an important celebration on April , to mark the birthday of Kim Il-sung, his grandfather and the founder of the country.Continuing the rumours, a Chinese journalist Shijian Xingzou said a “very solid source” told her the North Korean leader had died.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

will set out his plans to ease the lockdown in a major speech on Sunday night.He is not expected to make immediate sweeping changes, but set out a “roadmap” detailing how restrictions may be eased in future.Under the ‘bubble plan’, Brits would be allowed to pick a small number of people to hang out with.Once you have picked your ‘bubble’ you would be under strict orders not to mix with another one.It means grandparents may face a tough choice between which parts of the family to see.While friendships will be tested as people decide who makes the cut.A Scottish government document outlining the plan states: “We are consideringand how we could make changes to allow people to meet with a small number of othersoutside their own household in a group or “bubble” that acts as a single, self-contained unit, without connections to other households or bubbles.“It is possible that this option would be introduced first for outdoor meetings, ahead of any change to permit indoor meetings of the bubble.”You would still have to stick to social distancing rules when you spent time with anyone in your bubble.Andanyone in the group came down with Covid symptoms the others could be ordered to self-isolate for a fortnight.Currently, people are only meant to go outside for essential shopping or their daily exercise.But the document says ministers are considering “changes to allow people to leave their home more often and or for longer”.Factories and a larger array of shops are expected to be among the first wave of businesses allowed back to work when the lockdown eases.Brits could also be allowed to spend more time outside when the lockdown is eased.The plans have been drawn up by Scotland, but so far the devolved regions have worked in lockstep with Westminster on tackling coronavirus.Schools are not expected to reopen all at once under plans to loosen restrictions.Instead there will be a “phased approach” with Year  pupils expected to head back first.Dominic Raab on Tuesday night warned that sending all pupils back to school at the same time would risk a second spike in Covid infections.And the Scottish document warned that hospitals north of the border could be overwhelmed with Covid admissions within weeksall schools reopened.Mr Raab told the Downing Street press conference: “The one thing I can say with confidence is at least today, the evidence has been that we wouldnt be able to open up all schools, without a very real risk that the transmission rate would rise at such a level that we would risk a second spike.“But weve asked Sage for the options on this and will as ever be continued to be guided by the scientic advice we get.He also warned Brits that le will notto normal even after the lockdown is eased.He said: “As we consider the decisions that we will take next to protect le but also to protect our way of le, it’s now clear that the second phase will be dferent.“We will need to adjust to a new normal where we as a society adapt to safe new ways to work, to travel, to interact and to go about our daily lives.“We have never experienced anything like this first stage of Covid- in terms of the scale of the lives lost but also the lockdown it has required.“As we go forward we want to make sure that the next phase is more comfortable, is more sustainable and prevents lasting damage to jobs and livelihoods.”Ministers have been warned that fuming OAPs could revoltthey are treated dferently in the Covid lockdown.But the Health Secretary batted off claims the advice left pensioners under virtual house arrest – insisting only those with serious health conditions have been told not to go out.He added: “It’s a scientic fact that older people are much more susceptible to this disease”.Ministers also denied reports that peers over s would be retired from the House of Lords because of the Covid lockdown.Cabinet Office minister Lord True said there was “no substance” to this “third-rate story”.The Sun understands that bubbles would include no more than ten people. Andministers went ahead with the plan, bubbles of friends would be able to meet indoors as well as outside.They are not expected to be introduced in the first wave of easing the lockdown, but could be brought in later this monththe Covid rate of infection is low enough.But in a boost for cooped-up Brits, the PM is considering letting the nation head out for more than one exercise a day when he lays out his vision for easing the lockdown on Sunday night.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

The scheme could then be reduced even further over coming months - encouraging people to look for new jobs.A senior government source said: “People are addicted to the scheme.“We’re not talking about a clf-edge but we have to get people back to work.”The changes being considered are focused on “incentivising work,” another added.Mr Sunak is expected to announce how the job retention scheme will change after June next week.He wants to give firms certainty about the scheme beyond June and making an announcement by the end of next week is key because employers who are planning to make staff redundant in July must give  days notice. The deadline for this is May .The Sun understands that options being considered include only making the job retention scheme available to workers who the Treasury deem as most financially unstable.This could include renters who are living “hand-to-mouth” each month and whose large proportion of income goes on rent and bills. They are also less protected than homeowners, who are eligible for mortgage holidays. Although tenants can only apply for rental deferrals, landlords are not obliged to comply, while the move would also help prevent them being evicted due to unpaid rent.This could be administered by targeting certain age groups, such as millennials - workers in their s and s who are much more likely to rent.This idea would help young workers stay attached to their current jobs and help protect their future job prospects.Treasury insiders said changes to the scheme could see only workers in sectors that are deemed vital to protect kept on the furlough scheme.This could also allow the Treasury to keep workers furloughed in industries that are likely to be closed longer-term, such as pubs, restaurants, hotels and the tourism industry in general.But industry experts warned that this would cause problems for small businesses that don’t fit into one sector.Federation of Small Businesses chief Mike Cherry warned: “Government must avoid applying a sector straightjacket that doesn’t work for small firms – there are far too many businesses who don’t fit neatly into one box who will need time to get back up and running – like small companies that mainly supply to hotels but aren’t hospitality businesses.”The Treasury is also looking at allowing furloughed employees to work part-time. The Government’s subsidy would be smaller under this option, but it would avoid employers being forced to bar staff from working in order to be eligible for the wage support.The Treasury has said that designing a part-time furlough scheme would be much harder to administer.But officials have told industry groups that it is possible and they are waiting for “political direction”.The FSB’s Mr Cherry urged the Chancellor to prioritise working on finding a part-time furlough scheme that would offer businesses maximum flexibility as they attempt to reopen in the coming weeks.He said: “Small firms must be allowed to get back on their feet one step at a time –  million jobs depend on it.“It’s a dficult situation, but the only feasible option is to allow part time furloughing where furloughed staff canto work for part of their contracted hours. This will enable small employers to stagger back theof their staff at a time when we know economic activity will be at record low levels.”He added: “We need to see these changes made from the beginning of June as small businesses restart. Orders are going unfulfilled because a few hours work doesn’t justy bringing somebody off furlough. Businesses can’t even quote for jobs once lockdown lts. Time is of the essence.”News of the plans to tweak the job retention scheme come after Mr Sunak confirmed earlier this week that he was working on the best way to gradually close it down, which is currently due to run until the end of June.He told ITV News: To anyone anxious about this, I want to reassure that there will be no clf-edge to the furlough scheme.Im working as we speak to figure out the most effective way to wind down the scheme and ease people back into work in a measured way.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

the most critical test for easing lockdown.Ministers are worried it could amount to discriminationthe lockdown is eased for younger people, while older groups still have to heed stay-at-home advice.Professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University Mark Woolhouse said: The strategy works by concentrating efforts to control Covid- in the segment of the population that most needs protecting.It’s a nasty disease and we want to control it as much as we can, but it’s not so nasty in % of the population that we’d ever have contemplated locking down the whole country to control it.Professor Woolhouse stressed it would not be a magic bullet for curbing the outbreak, and contact tracing and other measures would still be crucial.Professor Woolhouse, who stressed he was speaking as an independent scientist, is also a member of the UK Government’s scientic pandemic influenza group on modelling .Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith said: A lot of people over  are fit and have kept themselves fit, often more so than people of other ages.There has been a backlash and people don’t think it’s the right way to go about it.It was revealed yesterday that the Governments top scientists modelled a longer lockdown of around  weeks for older and vulnerable people, compared with eight to  weeks for everyone .The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesfound the outcome of a longer lockdown for the most vulnerable could reduce deaths by up to  per cent - or up to  per centcombined with self-isolation for those who have symptoms and their households.Ministers are understood to have considered the idea, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock did not rule it out when pressed on the idea yesterday.A spokesman for No said earlier this week it was perfectly reasonably that we will look at how guidance will apply for dferent age bands and well continue to be guided by the science.There is a massively disproportionate risk of death when elderly and vulnerable people catch coronavirus.Boris Johnson is expected to lay out his blueprint for how Britain will ease restrictions on Sunday.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said the next phase should be more comfortable and more sustainable for Brits.Restrictions on outdoor activities are likely to be lted first, Downing Street said yesterday.People may be able to enjoy the outdoors with small bubbles of families and friends over coming weeks.For the rest of Britain, some form of social distancing and hand hygiene will still be needed, but more drastic restrictions could be relaxed without setting off a second wave of infections.Oxford University professor of gerontology Sarah Harper said classing all over s as vulnerable would mean some healthy, active, older iniduals could be sentenced to their homes unfairly.She said: “Easing lockdown might be more effectivethe risks were explicitly explained to the population, the possible range of vulnerabilities highlighted and iniduals asked to take appropriate action.These are sensible public health approaches which might have a better chance of being complied with.Senior mental health experts share Professor Harpers concerns, saying healthy, elderly Brits needed to be freed from lockdown.  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

in an area with a population  times the size.All gyms are likely to be glad of the business when they eventually reopen.However, there could be a cap on new members joining due to social distancing.Many gym companies have frozen all membership payments for the duration of lockdown, including The Gym Group, Pure Gym, DW Fitness First, Virgin Active, Nuffield Health and David Lloyd.Gym fees already paid will be either refunded by most gyms or added to accounts as a credit.Its not currently possible to sign up to new memberships at most major gym chains."},{"url":null,"title":"exercise more lockdown","story":"Ministers are looking at allowing more than one form of exercise a day during the first stage of Britain’s lockdown exit strategy.The Government are believed to favour more outdoor activity given the lower risk of infection compared to indoors.This could see the Prime Minister allow golf courses, tennis clubs and finish lakes to reopen next month.Mr Johnson is expected to renew the social distancing rules on Thursday before outlining his lockdown exit strategy on Sunday.Under the current lockdown rules people are only allowed outside their home to exercise once a day.According to the Mail Online, new guidelines will say golfers must use their own clubs and play just one other person.Tennis players could be asked to wear gloves on court, as well as restricted to playing with members of their household.Officials are also looking at whether open-air swimming could be includedchanging facilities stay shut.Outdoor exercise classes such as pilates and yoga could also participants are able to spread out in a large open space.It comes after the Governments Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieswarned Ministers not to forget “low risk” changes that could boost the nations morale.They said: “It may be dficult to justy easing restrictions solely for economic activities without any easing of restrictions for low risk activities with signicant social and psychological benefit.”Ministers are also looking at letting people meet up with a small “bubble” of their friends and relatives.Families could also be allowed to leave their home more often, and for longer, in time to soak up the summer sunshine.The proposals are being considered by ministers as they try to carve a path out of the strict lockdown and to a “new normal”. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle baby archie first birthday","story":"The mum is seen reading Duck!

James Brokenshire, the Security Minister, accepted errors in the governmentaposs response will be looked at robustly and rigorously after the pandemic. New figures yesterday showed a total of , deaths involving Covid- have now been registered across the UK. In Italy, the European country which first suffered an outbreak on a horric scale, that figure stood at , as of pm on Tuesday. The government says it is too early to make a proper international comparison. But so far, the officially-recorded death toll is the highest in Europe. Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance accepted last night it would have been beneficial to have more testing capacity quicker.for the Mirror Politics newsletter at www.mirror email -at .am to navigate the day ahead. The UK abandoned community testing and thorough contact tracing on March  after it became clear the virus was spreading beyond control. Not even care home staff, or people discharged into care homes from hospital, were being routinely tested until the last few weeks. Thousands of people have died with Covid- in care homes. Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, accepted the nation would have taken a dferent approachmore tests were available. Now that capacity has been ramped up, a test, track and trace approach will be brought back - this time with an NHS app - to try to contain a second peak.  Today Mr Brokenshire told Sky News: There is an acknowledgement that mistakes have been made and no government is going to get everything right. Asked for an example of a mistake, the Security Minister said testing had already been raised as one issue. Speaking to BBC Radio aposs Today programme, he added: There will be firm and clear opportunity once we are through this pandemic to absolutely look at those issues, robustly, rigorously. And that is I think the right moment for that.  Mr Brokenshire told the BBC: It is an absolute tragedy for anyone to lose a loved one. And there will be, Iaposm sure, plenty of reflection and time once we are through this terrible virus to be able to look at actions that have been taken and to see what lessons can be learned, what mistakes have been made. And every government I think will need to do that and we are no exception to that. He went on: I think the challenge is that as a country, whilst we are amazing at so many dferent things - we have these world-leading laboratories - overall capacity and scale is something that we did not have. Clearly there will be plenty of time for searching questions once we are through this, and how we ensure that we are as best prepared as we can be, learning and applying lessons from this experience. But at the same time we must be rigorously focused on the here and now, looking at these next steps and ensuring that we do that carefully, appropriately, to get through this virus.  Asked about the falling numbers of tests undertaken, with the Government failing to hit its , daily target for the third day in a row on Monday, Mr Brokenshire said capacity is there but demand will y.

Matt Hancock should be thanking her for all sheaposs doing on the frontline in the NHS.Dr Allin-Khan described how “frontline workers like me have had to watch families break into pieces as we deliver the very worst of news to them”. During health and social care questions in the House of Commons, the MP claimed that the government’s strategy on testing had been “non-existent”, and suggesting that the “testing figures are now being manipulated”. She added: “Does the Secretary of State commit to a minimum of , tests each day going forward  And does the Secretary of State acknowledge that many frontline workers feel that the government’s lack of testing has cost lives ”  The testing strategy has been non-existent.

It was Professor Neil Fergusonaposs advice that prompted Boris Johnson to put Britain in lockdown. He sat on the governmentaposs SAGE committee, which provides advice to ministers on their response to the pandemic. He also sat on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group . The Government Office for Science confirmed he had aposstepped backapos from both bodies. Professor Ferguson, nicknamed Professor Lockdown is an infectious disease epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said he believed he was immune to the virus, after self isolating with symptoms in March.  He leads the team that produced shock research claiming more than , people would die from the virus in the UK unless lockdown restrictions were introduced. Itaposs claimed his lover travelled across London on two occasions to spend time with the expert. He told the : I accept I made an error of judgement and took the wrong course of action. I have therefore stepped back from my involvement in SAGE [the governmentaposs Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies]. “I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms.  He added: “I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic. “The Government guidance is unequivocal, and is there to protect all of us.” "},{"url":null,"title":"professor pantsdown might done favour","story":"NewsopinionProfessor Pantsdown might have done us all a favour by massaging the StaatsThe lockdown lothario has proved humanity endures, that some rules make no sense, and the government still liesShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  MAY Newsopinion\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He decided to rewrite the official government guidance he had urged the rest of us to follow, and opted to stay home, break the rules, and get laid. He and married lover Antonia Staats got fed up with being two meeters apart, and hooked up twice in two weeks. Ms Staats, who is married to a data scientist, was presumably hoping to benefit from nerd immunity.He was not anti her body, expressed a preference for the German-born model, and itaposs probably safe to assume he flattened her curves as she helped him past the peak.He has now outlined an exit strategy from his position as a senior member of the governmentaposs Screwing Around Group in Emergencies , claiming he thought he was immune from being caught.She, meanwhile, reportedly thought it would be fine to have it prof because she was treating two house husbands, on opposite sides of London, as though they were one husband.  Journalistic inquiries as to whether they had modelled this outcome are ongoing, and one hopes they had appropriate access to PPE. If only heaposd entered cockdown, as Deltapoll has found % of us have done in the past  weeks, and had a bit less sex. But whataposs good about him getting Covid-, I hear you ask. And will we ever get any Firstly, we were bored at breakfast, but bonking boffins brought us brevity by bedtime. For a while, the chilling atmosphere of fear and apathy has been titivated with a little spice - tittle-tattle, itaposs true, but like all the best gossip itaposs the sort that leaves those who hear it feeling morally superior. Second, whoever had Boris Johnson in the sweepstake for the first illicit coronashag is going to be sorely disappointed. Le takes everyone by surprise. But third and fourth thoughts are a little darker. What was the route of transmission for this story, which is about a man blamed for forcing the government into an expensive lockdown, and which first appeared in a newspaper blamed for being Boris Johnsonaposs personal mouthpiece It appeared without photographic evidence or reports from eyewitnesses, when both would usually be required to substantiate such a tale. The only confirmation appears to be the professoraposs confession, which is a curious response to an embarrassing story without publishable proof.And lastly,one of the nationaposs finest minds thinks the lockdown rules are too strict, then either they ARE too strict, or the nationaposs finest minds arenapost so fine after all. In which case their disease modelling and resulting lockdown might be in doubt, and my head hurts at all the possibilities that would need modelling next. Prof Ferguson said he assumed he was immune, having had and recovered from coronavirus. If thataposs a safe assumption to make, everyone  whoaposs recovered can get out and about as well - potentially millions of us.Ms Staats, it is said, considers the two households to be as one. If so, then it is surely also safe for isolating grandparents to socialise with isolating families, and for mutually-isolating neighbours to have playdates. It seems the government has had ideas in this direction already, briefing journalists people may be allowed to form aposbubblesapos with other households, and meet up for picnics. While the Prof has paid the price for going off-message, across the country there are many people thinking much the same. Thatthey and their loved ones have been locked down for weeks, and cannot possibly be infectious, thereaposs no harm in putting our arms around one another again."},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror how many lives","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: How many lives lost because Tories ignored Covid- warning signs We now know Boris Johnson continued to shake hands after SAGE advised against human contact.

This level of suffering was not inevitable. The way the virus spread through Italy and Spain offered a warning to the Government of the need to act with speed to contain the outbreak. Unlike some other countries, we were given a small but crucial window to prepare for this human disaster. Ministers not only squandered this opportunity, they stand accused of failing to heed medical and scientic advice. We know now that on the day the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies warned against human contact Boris Johnson was boasting about how many people he had shaken hands with. We know advisers were urging ministers to change misleading advice on social distancing and to implement lockdown faster. And we know widespread testing was abandoned in March as there were not enough kits. The PM has repeatedly said that from the outset the Government has followed the scientic advice. That has not always been the case. The question he needs to answer is: how many lives have been lost as a result  Now think big  The shadow of coronavirus will extend over this country long after the outbreak has been contained. Each day brings yet more evidence of the damage to jobs, businesses and industry. Staff are being shed in large numbers, millions have applied for universal credit and major firms fear for their survival. The immediate task is to support as many people as possible via the Government furlough scheme.

Having lost a child, and suffering with depression, the pair sold off their worldly possessions and spent £, on an old white Mercedes Sprinter. With their two kids Felix, four, and Angus, three, in tow, they decided to cruise across Europe, parking up in beach car parks and living off a weekly budget of €. Their new home was their campervan -  metres of floor space, containing a bed for themselves and their kids, a small kitchen and a portapotti in an IKEA storage box, which is their bathroom.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email The family have lived this way since April last year - and have just celebrated their one year anniversary of le on the road. Their new sense of freedom started to collapse as the coronavirus hit Spain and they had to remain confined to their campervan for seven weeks. Pete, , originally from Long Eaton, and Hannah, , from Bingham, met each other while working as engineers at an Marks and Spencer warehouse. They bought a house in Bilsthorpe and raised two children, until their mental health started to decline in early  after they lost a child. Pete said: We were running from our depression but it worked. I sat down one Saturday night and I said aposwhen was the last time we were really happy apos And it was when we were in a campervan for  days travelling around France. We knew other people that had done similar things, sold their house and gone exploring. The pair decided to rent out their property rather than sell, which is now their main source of income. They also raised £, from selling their belongings, including a gardening set. They began their journey in France, but have made their way through Spain, finally pitching up in the southern part of the country called Cabo de Gata.  We are not tourists, Pete added. We are not on holiday. We live in a van. We donapost eat out at restaurants. We eat tuna, sweetcorn, mayonnaise pasta three times a week. Hannah added: For me it is the lestyle of it all. I get to watch my kids grow up properly and not feel like we have to do this, that or the other. It is a lot less stressful. It is really the freedom of saying - what do you want to do today  And the heat as well. Pete said: We usually park up on beach car parks. We try and get as close to the coast to get the sea breeze - thataposs our cooling system. We have the sea ft from our backdoor. He said they come across many people living the same sort of lestyle. Some believe they are desperate or homeless and need free food while others are just fascinated by the van. We are not homeless. We are fortunate. But we donapost have a lot of money, he added. Our family are supportive. They could see how poor our mental health was at the time and that we have made it work. Everyone wants to know how our kids are being educated. They are not ready for normal school now. We practice counting and colouring with them - we count tunnels we go through and the colour of cars we pass. We also have a chalkboard on the inside of the backdoor.  The couple were sat on the beach close to where their campervan was parked when the news came out that coronavirus had hit Spain. They considered finding a hideaway in the wilderness, but then realised it was far more serious than they had first envisaged. We did not know how the police were going to act towards people in campervans, he said. If we left now it would be a long time before we could go back. Some days it was miserable in the van. We were very confined. It has been tough. The main ethos of this le is having the freedom to go where we want and when we want and having that taken away from you is quite claustrophic. Hannah added: The kids have been absolutely brilliant. Felix has kept everyone entertained. The pair said the Spanish community have been very supportive and they remained on lockdown for seven weeks, unable to even go to the beach.

I am so appreciative of everything they have done for us.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email Speaking of the traumatic month Omar spent in ICU, she added: They didn’t think he was going to make it and neither did we. I used to sit by the phone waiting for the call to say he had passed away. Omar, who has a daughter Vivienne, four, and son Harrison, two, became unwell after birthday celebrations on March , and made the decision to self-isolate at his mother’s home. Kaitlyn said: At first I told him to get a grip and told him he was hungover - but on March  he called an ambulance which brought him to hospital. They kept him in less than  hours and sent him home saying he probably had a chest infection. He went home and for a whole week he could not get out of bed.  On March , Omar, a Care UK regional manager, was rushed back to hospital and admitted to Mersea ward, where three days later it was confirmed he had Covid-. Kaitlyn said: He was transferred to ICU on March  and he was unconscious. One morning I woke up at .am and I had ten missed calls from the hospital.

After the scan they started waking him up and weaning him off the sedatives. But, against everyoneaposs expectations, Omar survived and has already made remarkable progress on the hospital’s stroke ward, where he has been since April . He has now had two negative Covid- tests, and Kaitlyn said he is walking again already. She said: He can’t talk but he never lost cognition, so he understands everything which is going on. Doctors say it’s going to be an intensive, long and very slow recovery process. He will be on this stroke unit for several weeks and then go to a rehab facility to continue his recovery. But, the big picture is that he is lucky to have made it through this horrible ordeal with this virus. The cards were stacked heavily against him. Iaposm so proud of him. He will require help to complete his recovery - but Omar hopes to go home with his family soon.

Teaching assistant Katie added: Everything that they’re coming back with at the moment is just really positive.

You just can’t help but think that this might be it and this is the biggest thing that has happened and hopefully will happen in our letimes. There has been some debate over the timescale of producing a vaccine and how long it would take to make on a large scale. But last week AstraZeneca - a drugs company based in Cambridge - signed an agreement with the university to distribute it around the world when the time comes.  Katie said some people she spoke to had been alarmed at the idea of being injected with the untested new formula. She cited the famous case of Thalidomide - the drug prescribed for morning sickness in the s which later turned out to cause deformities in babies. She said: A lot of people are saying: aposI would never do thatapos. But the days of Thalidomide are gone - they wouldn’t take the risks with people’s lives anymore. People that have actually done their homework know what we’re being injected with. Others have said: ‘Oh you must be going into quarantine now ’. But we’re not being injected with the real thing - it’s a vaccine. The family will have another appointment at the end of the month for more blood tests. The next phase of the trial is to begin vaccinating larger numbers of people.

Back in February, the news of the mystery virus sweeping through the Chinese city of Wuhan seemed a distant threat. Her mind was preoccupied with home le after the couple had a fight devastating enough to collapse the foundation of their relationship. Kat - whose name has been changed - began wonderingit was time to call an end to their engagement, and began anxiously plotting her next move.But within weeks, coronavirus was on Britainaposs doorstep. to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at  mirror email  -after the press conference every evening. Opting to stay put, Kat tellsthat she doubts she is the only one gritting her teeth in relationship limbo as households around the world stay at home during the pandemic. I am sure other couples would find it so sad and depressing. They would end up staying together for their everyday wellbeing rather than thinking about deep down what is right for them. She had contemplated how spending more time than ever together could have presented an opportunity to work out problems with her fiancé - but instead has found it fastened her resolve to leave.  You have a lot of time to think. Sometimes we can live in a bubble of brush it off, plan for the future or just keep going for now. The position we’re in makes that very hard and confrontational. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to review the UKaposs lockdown restrictions this weekend, and leaked reports suggest social distancing could last as long as a year.So for an untold number of Brits unhappily shacked up like Kat, lockdown means hitting pause on beginning a new le. Her family lives abroad, and most countries have already restricted all but essential travel. Quitting her relationship would mean leaving her job and the country - not to mention questions about who would be left to shoulder the coupleaposs rent bill.  And by the time Kat realised she really did want to leave, it was already too late. Typing secretly from another room - worried her fiance could overhead a call - she told us the pair are isolating together in increasing disharmony. She has not yet revealed to him her plans to leave as soon as the lockdown lts. Kat says she is worried about her furloughed partneraposs stress, and that theyaposll be stuck together in bitterness.

Living in close quarters with no chance of privacy, Kat says she has been unable to make calls to friends or family to ask for advice. Feeling unsure of when she will be able to make the move, Kat can only furtively tap away messages on her phone to her confidants - and try to keep the peace. It’s also a hard thing to bring up with family in the first place when youaposve been together for so long and they think everything is fine. She anxiously watches the news, certain that as soon as the lockdown lts sufficiently for her to move to start a new le it will be time to go. I think we both know it’s a very uncertain time, the world is in a very fragile place right now. Needless to say we will both be upset. Sometimes nobody is right or wrong. Kat, whose name is withheld to protect her privacy, is among an untold number for whom lockdown means le-changing decisions must be put on ice. But sociologists - and orce lawyers - will surely be watching the pandemicaposs effect on modern love and relationships unfold with a keen eye.  aposIsolationshipsapos in the time of coronavirus Plenty of Brits will be relishing more time spent at home as social distancing halts commutes and sees millions work from home.  Thousands of babies have been born already under lockdown - with some speculating there will be a boom over the next year.  Since the UK went into lockdown, weddings have been cancelled - or held over Zoom.aposSocially distant datesapos are being conducted over video chat by some singletons, and dating apps like Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, are encouraging people to carry out virtual romances. As couples who donapost live together are ordered to stay apart, stories are emerging of neighbours grassing on next-dooraposs overnight visitors, as police field hundreds of thousands of lockdown-breach reports. Unsurprisingly, pornography use is said to be up - and condom sales very much down.Councils are even encouraging Brits to have apossafe sexapos - with themselves as many hunker down into an indefinite dry spell - sacricing their sex lives for the health of the nation. Even Love Island is cancelled. In one surreal moment early on in the crisis, the UK governmentaposs chief health adviser dished out relationship advice as she addressed the nation. She encouraged anyone who didnapost already live with their romantic partner to consider fast-tracking shacking up to isolate together as lockdown restrictions came into force.But orce lawyers have predicted a grimmer trend as tension builds over lockdown-induced financial troubles, and cracks develop between couples forced into a aposfishbowlapos lestyle.  Quarantine cracks start to show Irritating habits and sour relationship dynamics take on a higher pitch when quarantine le means being subjected to your partneraposs work Zoom calls on a daily basis. Anita Scorah, partner in the family law team at SAS Daniels Solicitors, says typical relationship gripes are likely to be amplied when couples are stuck in close quarters for a prolonged period of time.  She predicts fights over unequal ision of household chores, as slobby habits and dferent views on gender roles in domestic duties become more apparent as partners spend more time at home. Being unable to keep children quiet or keep them out of the way while a partner attempts to work from home could cause tensions for some, she says. And a squeeze on stress-release options - as gyms are closed, holidays out of bound and socialising forbidden - could leave couples feeling trapped with no private spaces. Police guidelines have confirmed it is acceptable to leave home and visit a friend to stay following a domestic fall-out. But the expert warns one of the strongest factors that she sees triggers splits - financial anxiety - will not just be limited to couples experiencing redundancies, furloughing and wage cuts at this stage of the pandemic. She predicts pressure on relationships further down the line, as the chilling economy bites.  Banks are reducing interest rates on savings, investments in the markets have fallen -%, pension values have consequently been hit, property values are uncertain, Ms Scorah warns. Covid- has pulled the rug on financial security. There is no means by which you could have invested and avoided a loss. Financial worry is a huge trigger for poor mental health and stress. Lockdown aposcatching out the unfaithfulapos Siobhan Vegh, family law solicitor at Cordell  Cordell says the law firm has been seeing a slight but noticeable increase in the number of orce enquiries already. She says a number of them have come from clients who have uncovered cheating which has been more dficult to hide thanks to the lockdown. Thereaposs little stopping you from obtaining a orce - evenyou have to stay under the same roof for sometime yet under lockdown. Most cases wonapost even need to go to court - but they are still running, with court staff and judges working from home and hosting hearings over telephone and videolink. Importantly, cases involving domestic abuse and child protection are going to the top of the queue. While you could get a orce, but whether you should right now is not a straight-forward - and will depend heavily on your financial hit you are able to take, according to one legal expert. Emma Davies, specialist orce solicitor in Nelsons’ family law team says now could be a good time to get orced -you are the partner with the fattest wallet. “For some, a financial downturn could be seen as an advantage when it comes to orce and securing a favourable financial settlement. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, many assets may well have diminished in value. Businesses may not be considered as valuable, investments are likely to have suffered, and some pensions will now be worth less than they were only a few short weeks ago. “For the party to a marriage who is – or was prior to the pandemic – in a stronger financial position, the answer to the question ‘should I orce now’ might well be yes. Hopefully, the economy will bounce back, as will the value of your assets, leaving you better off thanyou had orced in more stable times.” However she adds that courts will potentially delay financial settlements amid the coronavirus economic climate, and may even wait aposuntil the storm has passedapos to ide marital assets. For many splitting couples, the biggest fight could be over how to ide up the family home in unfavourable selling conditions. Ms Davies warned the governmentaposs suspension of the housing market in March and jittery banks could see potential buyer numbers decline. This, of course, could throw settlements into jeopardy and possibly increase a couple’s capital gains tax liabilities when they do end up reaching a deal.”   We have been seeing a surprising number of enquiries from people exploring their options, either because of existing issues in their relationships that have come to a head while isolating together, or because one spouse has been caught out as being unfaithful, she told the Mirror. Often, unfaithful spouses are less able to hide and maintain extra marital affairs without leaving the house and minor disagreements can become intensied.” Locked down and in danger - with no means of escape In too many of Britainaposs homes relationship breakdowns can be a matter of le and death. In recent weeks Britain recorded an increase in domestic violence helpline calls around the UK. And ChildLine has said it has also received a spike in calls from children stuck with their abuser.  A leading domestic violence researcher is concerned that isolation will exacerbate abusersapos behaviour as financial and mental health issues whip up rage.The government launched the aposYou Are Not Aloneapos campaign to raise awareness that abuse victims are allowed to walk out during lockdown. University of Buckingham law professor Susan Edwards warns calls for help are likely to be only the apostip of the icebergapos and the government must brace itself to tackle the problem into the long-term. She is concerned women are finding themselves forced to stay silent as controlling partners spying on their every move behind closed doors, robbing them from the privacy needed to seek help. Many children who live with violence in the home have temporarily lost their key safe haven - school and watchful teachers, Prof Edwards says. She fears a new spike in domestic violence homicides will emerge once the UKaposs lockdown lts. Research shows women are most of risk of dying at the hands of their partner at the time they try to leave the relationship. Not only is the lockdown pausing victimsapos attempts to flee abuse, but money worries caused by the pandemic likely to make it harder to leave in a hurry once it lts, the professor adds.  She worries that continued social distancing restrictions will make it dficult for people in abusive relationships to seek an escape route.“They are not only isolated from family, they are isolated from getting out and using the support they need.The abuser is in the room, in control of the technology for asking for support - he might have a tracker on the phone and the usual routes of escape or advice for women are shut down.” “There’s a lot of talk about ‘contact your family - keep in touch’ - there’s lots of great ideas, but for women who are victims of domestic violence this is not an option.”  aposLockdown could even lead to reunionsapos One family lawyer suspects many shaky families will hunker down and stay put after weathering pandemic pressures. Already economic insecurity caused by the virus is causing some British couples to rethink splitting altogether, according to Louise Allard, of Allard Bailey Family Law. Job losses, a chilly housing market and uncertainty could be particularly likely to prompt a rethink among couples with children. One of her clients who had started orce proceedings before lockdown kicked in had already called to tell her the breakup is off.

Following Ellenaposs death, all of her possessions have remained exactly as they are in her home. Hanging from one wardrobe door is the red dress that gives the empty home its nickname but it is far from the only belonging left behind from a forgotten time. Ellenaposs picture, including one of her in the red dress, hangs from the walls still covered in places in fading s floral wallpaper. Where the wallpaper has tumbled to earth, heavy stone covers the walls, harking back to the time the dairy farm was first built. Love letters and notes from friends strewn the floor and havenapost been read for almost  years, their personal messages now forgotten. Family snaps line the fireplace, black and white images of people long dead, as dust covers arms chairs and their cushions. Beds still have their covers on them and curtains still hang in the windows, many of them cracked and broken as nature forces its way into the house.

I wanted to see what  was inside. I felt like I was in someoneaposs home uninvited, I expected the owner to walk round every corner I saw. When I climbed the stairs to enter the main bedroom, I opened the door and to the right there was a photo of the lady in the garment on her dressing table with all her makeup and other personal items on it. I then turned to the left and saw an open wardrobe with that red dress hung up, it was a very eerie feeling assomeone was there, and I thought it was her at first glance.

One hungry customer is reported to have spent nearly £ on food from their local branch in Exeter. Mammoth queues of traffic stretching  plus cars long have been forming outside the popular restaurants with locked down Brits desperate for their southern fried fix. Alongside the likes of Burger King, KFC was one of the first fastfood outlets to begin trading again last week, a month-and-a-half after closing. Fty-five restaurantsapos drive-thru lanes are now operating again, with even more offering deliveries - though customers are still not permitted to have sit-down meals inside. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  Photos on social media show people with their orders - with dozens said to be queueing for more than an hour to get their food. Graeme Long, from Birmingham, uploaded a video onto his social media pages and said it was the funniest thing I’ve seen in lockdown, adding: I could not believe my eyes.” Paige Henley said: KFC opens and the whole of Exeter rush there like everybody’s been starving for weeks.  Another person in Exeter reportedly spent £ on their takeaway order, reports DevonLive. David Harrison tweeted: Just fuelled up the van, drive past KFC to see  plus cars queued up in drive through! It really must be finger licking good. Tom Longley described the queues outside a KFC in Queens Road, Sheffield, as absolute bedlam since it reopened.Saw a woman in the car park today screaming at a delivery driver for coming within m of her, he continued. She knows that social distancing is important but can’t see that going to f*****g KFC isn’t. It also appears some were taking the re-openings as a green-light to flout lockdown rules, including congregating in groups.Clf Morgan said: Caused massive queues in Doncaster and people then congregating in park opposite to eat - no respect for the NHS workers , close the lot of them now! This comes as the government is considering letting small groups of family and friends mingle, but this is unlikely to come into play for weeks. A spokesman for the chain said branches had been gradually re-opened, with  restaurants in the UK to be operating for deliveries by Monday. They added: “We are doing this responsibly and carefully, with stringent processes and hygiene measures put in place. All our restaurants will continue serving a limited menu to help the smaller kitchen teams maintain social distancing.

Archie is wearing a white t-shirt and a nappy, while Meghan looked casual and relaxed in a blue shirt and shorts. Archie gets involved straight away and starts turning the pages, but he gets a bit overexcited and keeps turning quicker than mum Meghan can read. There is a moment where it sounds like he might be about to start crying, but heaposs soon distracted by the book. As Meghan tries to get him to focus on the pictures on the page, she lets slip her adorable nickname for her little boy. She says: Letaposs go to the next page, look Arch.  It works a treat, and Archie immediately turns back to the page sheaposs looking at. The cute moniker was the inspiration behind Meghan and Harryaposs upcoming non-profit project, which they will call Archewell, derived from the Greek word for “source of action”. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are understood to be working on plans to run emotional support groups and even a multi-media educational empire.  After reading the next sentence about duck noises, Meghan quacks in Archieaposs ear and Harry does the same from behind the camera.

Meghan starts to take it off him, but he drops it on the floor instead, to which Meghan says uh-oh.  She picks it up again, whispering: shall we get the book back, weaposll read this one next, before carrying on. But Archie has clearly changed his mind and picks it up and throws it on the floor again. Meghan smiles straight into the camera as Harry tried to contain his giggles.

She told The Sun: “I think it’s important that people realise the virus is deadly. It’s too early to lt lockdown as people are dying. It’s wiped out a whole family.” Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than  frontline NHS and care workers have lost their lives to the virus.  Keith, of South Shields, was dad to Ben,  and Olivia, , and trained to become a nurse in Birmingham. He had planned to help at one of the Nightingale hospitals before his death. Yvonne Ormston MBE, chief executive of Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust said: It is with tremendous sadness that we announce the passing of Keith Dunnington. Keith was a long-serving Staff Nurse who worked on medical, surgical and elderly wards here at Gateshead Health NHS FT. Keith was a popular and hard-working member of our fantastic nursing team. He will be very missed by his co-workers here at the trust and by the patients he cared for.  Ms Ormston added: Keith most recently worked on Ward  where his colleagues remember him very fondly. He was known for always having a positive outlook which others found really encouraging and for taking time to check-in with colleagues. On Sundays he put particular importance on everyone having a proper dinner and often arranged food for everyone. When not at work he volunteered at soup kitchens and spent time with his family, who he spoke so highly about. My thoughts are with Keith’s family, friends and colleagues at this incredibly sad and dficult time. The trust said that although Keith was very much part of the QE family, he was employed by nursing agency Pulse Jobs.

Professor Willison cited research from the Weizmann Institute of Science claiming that outbreaks are less likelypeople are exposed to others for four rather than five days.

Why  Because stronger communities are healthier, happier, less ided places to live and work.But also, because they are better able to withstand the shocks when tragedy strikes. Coronavirus has been a tragedy for so many people up and down Britain. As a family, we weren’t able to be with Jo when she died. Now, in very dferent circumstances, thousands of others like us are having to come to terms with not being able to hold a loved one’s hand or offer any comfort in those last moments. Our readers up and down the country are overcoming isolation by connecting with people they wouldnapost usually meet for an online chat. Do you want to join them YES IaposM IN The country responded to Jo’s death with amazing warmth and compassion. People took her words that we all have ‘more in common than that which ides us’ to their hearts. As we hoped, something good and powerful came out of tragic circumstances. Today that same spirit is in evidence in every city, town and village across Britain. People are connecting with others more often, and with more determination and creativity than ever before.Not just helping the most vulnerable, although that is vital, but simply being there for neighbours, distant relations, and folk in the community who might have been strangers a few months ago but now feel like friends.

She has sung it on radio, TV, and film, in the Royal Albert Hall and outside Buckingham Palace. But just after pm on Friday, she will open the living room window of her home in Ditchling, East Sussex, and sing it again with a new passion. And, as the strains of We’ll Meet Again ring out into the evening air, Dame Vera will be thinking of all those brave fighting men she met and performed for during our darkest hours. For, while the whole nation marks the th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, the -year old Forces Sweetheart will feel it with particular poignancy. “I still think about those boys you know,” she reveals quietly. “And I’ve never stopped wondering how many of them actually made it home.” Her  record became a wartime anthem of love, hope and resilience. And when the Queen quoted it in her pandemic address to the nation, last month, it took on new signicance in this very dferent war. So Dame Vera – who was made a Companion of Honour to the Queen in  – joined forces with Welsh mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins and released a duet of the song to raise money for NHS workers and volunteers. And Friday’s VE Day commemorations will culminate with a nationwide rendition of We’ll Meet Again. “It will be lovely,” says Dame Vera. “I hope it will give us all strength and hope in these dficult times. But it’s also about remembering the sacrices of the war, and the sense of release on May , .” On that day Dame Vera was back home in Barking, East London, with her parents and grandmother. “We were in our garden listening to the wireless when it was announced,” she says. “We sat in the sun thinking ‘What wonderful news!’ We were thrilled. I don’t think we shed a tear though, you did that privately. People didn’t show their emotions.  “I think we had a cup of tea, perhaps later a sherry. We raised a toast with our neighbours across the garden fence.” A year before Dame Vera had been in the Far East, entertaining troops at a crucial point in the Burma Campaign. Hearing her sing The White Clfs of Dover, A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square and There’ll Always Be an England boosted the morale of the “forgotten” th Army, whose heroism in the jungles went largely overlooked during the war itself. So on Friday she will think particularly of the men who were still fighting in the Far East as the VE Day celebrations in Blighty got under way.  Looking at an album of treasured photos, she recalls: “I wasn’t allowed to take my own camera with me to Burma but after I got home all the boys started sending me their pictures. “That’s why my daughter and I wrote our book, Keep Smiling Through, about my time there. A lot found it hard to speak about the war and I used to get lots of letters from their families. Unless you experienced it you had no idea what it was like. “That’s why it’s so important that schools teach children what it was all about. So we never, ever forget.” Dame Vera grew up in East London with dressmaker mum Annie, plumber dad Bert and elder brother Roger.  She began singing in working men’s clubs at the age of seven and, in her teens, was working with big bands such as the Joe Loss Orchestra. At  she released her first record, Up the Wooden Hill to Bedfordshire, and when war broke out she was already a radio favourite. In , her Sunday night radio show Sincerely Yours became a morale booster for troops and their families. She had met husband Harry Lewis in the s while they were both in the Bert Ambrose Orchestra. They married in  and had a daughter, Virginia, in . Harry died in .  “I think of him every day,” says Vera, “He was the love of my le.” Early in the war, newspaper readers voted Vera their Forces Sweetheart. “It came as a surprise,” she says. “I’d always tried to imagine I was sitting at home by the fire, singing to people in the same room. But I became a messenger, linking separated people. It is very humbling. “I saw it as my duty to keep on singing. I thought that tag would disappear after the war and I’d just be another singer.”  Perhaps she would,she had not taken the brave step to go and sing for troops in Egypt, India and Burma in , aged . “I wanted to go where I was most needed,” she says. Getting to Burma involved a gruelling ,-mile trip via the USA, with her pianist, piano and a pistol. She then spent four months in a camp entertaining the troops as the bloody Battle of Kohima raged nearby. “It was nice to meet them in person,” she says. “I liked being one of them, living in a tent with one bucket for washing and one for the toilet. “I was never the glamorous type like Betty Grable. My make-up would run off in the heat so I only bothered with a lipstick.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman found wandering through town","story":"NewsWoman found wandering through town after escaping sex slave houseGreater Manchester Police found a woman in her twenties wandering the streets of Salford after she escaped from a property where she was being made to operate as a sex workerShareByPaige Oldfield:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe woman was found in Salford [file image] \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Four of teacher Carol-Ann Challoneraposs family - all key workers - have contracted the killer bug, and tragically her mum died in hospital. The -year-old, who fell ill in March, praised NHS staff and told the Liverpool Echo some of the things I saw on the ward will stay with me forever. Carol-Ann said she, her father Joey an ambulance driver, her mother Carol, a social worker and her brother Joseph, who works with children who have learning dficulties, all had dferent symptoms of the contagious virus. She told how her family had symptoms ranging from a rash to cold shivers and flu-like symptoms. And that while in hospital youaposre hearing that people are dying and you forget how to breathe. Carol-Ann laid bare the traumatising reality of coronavirus and how our NHS staff are compassionately caring for people in extraordinary circumstances. Despite revealing doctors and nurses had to wear mountains of protective gear, Carol-Ann said: They seemed so deflated, but they still tried to put a smile on your face.  Carol-Ann was so moved by the compassion of Aintree Hospital staff she is fundraising for them as a thank you. Teacher Carol-Ann, from Croxteth Park, said she was first admitted to Aintree Hospital in March after struggling to breathe. While in there, Carol-Annaposs beloved mum, Carol Challoner, , was also admitted and fought coronavirus too. Sadly Carol passed away in hospital, and tributes have flooded in for the caring social worker since. Carol-Ann has spoken to the ECHO about her experience in hospital and why she wants to give back to the doting staff who cared for her. Carol-Ann, said: I developed a rash, and I just thought it was allergies. It seemed at the time when I was eating bread I was coming out in a rash, and Iaposd just changed washing powder, so I thought it was that.  I didnapost really take any notice of it. The day after my dad came home from work and I was having my tea that night with my mum and dad, I donapost live with them but I cook for them and they cook for me. He came home and he said aposI really donapost feel well, I canapost get warmapos. He didnapost join us for tea, but then he developed all signs of Covid-. The day after that I started developing symptoms as well. The morning after was the last day the Government were keeping schools open and I wanted to say goodbye to my Year s, and I was thinking of going in. Luckily I didnapost go in because I felt too unwell. We all had dferent symptoms, I had the rash, my dad got cold shivers and flu-like symptoms. So I self-isolated for a week, my dad self-isolated for a week.  In March, not as much information was known about the deadly disease as is now, and theories have since developed about its effect on families. Carol-Ann said: There are , things going round in your head because youaposre hearing that people are dying. It was weird, it sounds really stupid but itaposs like you forget how to breathe. Youaposre focusing on to how to actually breathe. I was taken up to the Amber ward, where anyone who hadnapost tested positive or were awaiting results were sent there. It was all a bit of a blur, and I slept through most of it, but I was put on an IV drip, I was put on oxygen quite high. I just remember it blasting up my nose and I think I just slept. Describing the heavy kit hospital workers were wearing to protect themselves, Carol-Ann said she was concerned about how comfortable they were.  She said: They were all wearing the plastic gowns, the gloves. They had material gowns on but all the nurses were tripping over them, they were too long. Some of them wore goggles, some of them wore visers. I know myself with the oxygen mask just above the ear, it just takes away the skin. Theyaposre putting these masks on all day, so God knows what it must be like. I felt so sorry for them because one, theyaposve got the scrubs on, then theyaposve got the gowns on, then theyaposve got the aprons on.  And then the goggles and the visers and everything. I donapost know where they could actually breathe or have breathing space. All the nurses said aposI cant wait to go home and take a shower, or go in the bath, or put my pyjamas onapos. Just watching them I felt so sorry for them. They just seemed so deflated but they still tried to put a smile on your face. Noticing the compassionate daily care doctors and nurses were giving to patients, Carol-Ann said she also overheard some heartbreaking conversations where staff had to discuss do-not-resuscitateoptions with patients.

Whilst some people add cream, or butter, to the potatoes Rob Nixon - who is hailed as Australiaaposs Gordon Ramsay - has a slightly dferent tip for creating mash which is creamy, smooth and packed with flavour. He uses the potato skins... Yes, thataposs right. Now usually, most of us throw the skins away as soon as theyaposre peeled - but not anymore. In a video shared to his TikTok channel, Nickoaposs Kitchen, Rob explained that in order to make the best potatoes, you must soak the skins in simmering milk. He said: This will allow the flavour of the skin to infuse into the milk. Rob starts by peeling his potatoes - he recommends using a floury white-flesh potato and then sets them aside for later. He then cuts the potatoes in half, and cooks in lightly seasoned boiling water for - minutes, or until tender.  He continues by draining the potatoes and popping them into a potato ricer over a sieve.  Rob says pushing the potatoes through the ricer will remove all of the lumps - butyou donapost have one he suggests using a hand masher. After seasoning with salt and pepper, he adds softened butter and mixes well. Over a high heat he adds his milk and the potato skin, and allows them to heat for two minutes.

Anglers fed the dog, believed to be partly a Black Russian Terrier, but they could not catch the animal to free him from his lonely vigil.The anglers nicknamed him Hachiko, after a legendary Japanese pet that waited more than nine years for its owner who had died, reports the Daily Star.He spent months waiting at Nagaev Bay in Magadan, a port on the Sea of Okhotsk. Recently animal rights activists became concerned because the sea ice is now melting and there were fears he would drown. To finally catch the pining dog they used a snowmobile from the local search and rescue service. The animal was shot with a sedative and then loaded into a fishing net to be taken to local kennels.  He was given medical checks but despite two months on the ice was found to be in good condition, said Anastasia Pavlova, head of Zoo Spas, which took part in the rescue. Now named Chernysh - meaning Blackie - he has been moved to the home of his new owners, an angler who helped feed him during his ice ordeal. But he remains nervous, curling up on a work surface, wanting to get back to the sea.

For most of April the North Korean despot was no where to be seen. Following a notable absence from celebrations to mark his late grandfatheraposs birthday, rumours began swirling that the -year-old had come to some kind of harm.Some speculated that he had died of the coronavirus, while others suggested he had died at the shaky hands of a heart surgeon. to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at  www.mirror email The chatter surrounding Kimaposs wellbeing reached fever pitch at the end of April, when it was reported that he had been blown up by a missile launch gone wrong. Then suddenly Kim appeared at a fertiliser factory seemingly in good health. Footage and photos of his walk around have not proved enough to quiet some of the more fervent sceptics however. Some have suggested that a body-double is standing in for the dictator, while others have argued that he was absent for a period of post-plastic surgery rehab.  Online sleuths have put the spotlight on Kimaposs wrinkles, teeth, nose, ears and hairline to suggest something is amiss. One photo seems to show the leaderaposs teeth looking straighter and whiter than before. There have been suggestions that the photo was doctored, or that Kimaposs teeth have been altered via a relatively simple proceedure. His earlobes have also been scrutinised, because of the way they seemingly no longer attach to his head with a smooth curve.As for his altered hairlines, it has been suggested that this may have been achieved by a skilled barber. If Kim has been replaced by a body double, it would not be the first time. In  he was pictured alongside two look-alikes wearing matching black suits while at a missile launch. It has been suggested that he travels with body doubles in a bid to foil assassination attempts. Further adding to the mystery, Kim was missing from a ceremony in which Russia was due to award him a medal to mark the th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany.

in their club.Mal Brannigan – the United chief who had been in discussions with the organisation – left his post as managing director on Friday.The DUSF’s John Gibson said: “We would be happyMr Ogren wanted to get back round the table.“We’re still really hurt by this and feel as though we’ve been thrown under the bus.“We never understood why such a damaging statement was released but we just want the best for the club.“In our last conversation with Mal Brannigan, we made it clear that we hadn’t shut the door on anything.”In a statement issued on April , Ogren claimed the Tangerines could not agree to the conditions tied to potential DUSF investment and would be creating a new foundation themselves.He said: “After initially being told the organisation was there to assist our club with monies which have been raised throughout their membership, we as a board were not willing to fulfil the unreasonable demands of DUSF encompassing a requirement for shares and thereafter a secured loan.“This is particularly troublesome to us considering the size of the overall investment Scottand I have put into Dundee United FC and quite frankly goes against all the values that we have as owners and as a club.”The DUSF defended its proposals as “fair and reasonable”.They said: “Our objective was to protect our members’ interests whilst also enabling us to assist the club.“We have also had to ensure we discharge our duties as directors of a private company limited by guarantee by showing prudence and due diligence before recommending the release of a six-figure sum of members’

reaction spfl vote u turn john nelms","story":"John Nelms says he understands the frustrations of Dundee fans after his voting U-turn saw Dundee United crowned Championship winners # but insists the decision was “for the best of the football club”.And he’s thanked “amazing” supporters who have already spent their hard-earned money on a season ticket for the next campaign despite not knowing when it will start or what it might look like.The Dens Park managing director was at the centre of the voting storm that engulfed Scottish football last month as the Dark Blues’ deciding vote swung from a ‘no’ to a ‘yes’ and allowed the SPFL’s resolution to end the   season in the lower leagues to pass.It also granted rivals United the league title and promotion to the Premiership. After an unclear club statement that later emerged to be Dundee’s notice of submitting a ‘yes’ vote, some Dark Blues fans reacted angrily to the decision.Askedhe understood the feelings of the supporters, Nelms told the Tele: “Absolutely. I don’t ever really say which way I vote, I give principles of what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.“The last daywe did a holding statement saying we’re not going to make a statement until we actually do something and then the next statement came out because we actually did something and voted.“But, people didn’t realise that we actually voted. So, we had to put out another statement.“You know how I am, I don’t talk about players# contracts, I don’t do things like that because I don’t think it’s appropriate at the time because you are negotiating. You can’t do that in the public eye because it’s not beneficial for the football clubyou do it that way.“We talked about it and I could see why the fans were concerned.“Honestly, I’m not surethe fans can see it or not but we are doing whatever we can do for the best of the football club, always. Not once in a while, not when it suits, always.“We will make decisions that might not be popular among the fans in the short-term but overall in the long-term it will benefit the football club. That’s the way we will run the business and I don’t think we’ve done anything but that. I’ll take the heat for it and that comes with the territory.”The club haven’t had any match income for over seven weeks due to the coronavirus shutdown.Nelms says Dundee are in a “stable position” but accepts there is no way of knowing what the future might hold.“At the moment, the way we have the business set up, with insurances and the way the“It is a new reality. Our business has changed from getting excited and ready for the next match to basically survival.“We are trying to prepare for when we come out of this but we don’t really know what is going to happen – we have nine dferent budget options for next year.“We don’t know when we are going to start playing again and that is the hard, frustrating part of it all.”Asked how much the club is losing per month, Nelms replied: “This is one of these things where I won’t talk about specic numbers.“Every club is going to be dferent – most clubs don’t have the insurance policies we have in place so they will be losing more than we will.“The government has really stepped in and helped out the mid-sized to lower-end clubs.“At the bigger clubs with the salaries the players are on, although the furlough helps, it doesn’t help a huge amount.“I would say Dundee Football Club and others around the size of our club are at a pucker point where it really helps us out and it helps out clubs below us but above it won’t help out as much.“We’re OK at the moment but we don’t know what is going to happen.”Despite not knowing when the next campaign will be, fans have already been putting money into the club by buying season tickets for  .An “amazing” gesture says Nelms.“You can’t thank people enough in a day and age like this where every day you are living basically day-to-day to see people step up and buy season tickets is amazing,” he added.“It’s incredible to see the number of people who have bought them with a big unknown going forward.“We will be playing football at some point in time, we just don’t know exactly when.“The fact they have faith in the club and desperately want to see their team is helpful – and also helps us build the team based on the support we have.“We know there are

wilkie mal brannigan dundee united","story":"Mal Brannigan’s exit from Tannadice on Friday night was a surprise – for the first time in Mark Ogren’s reign there are some uncomfortable questions to answer.It did appear like a bolt out of the blue, Brannigan had been interviewed in this very paper just the day before he left his role as managing director.A sudden departure for a club’s managing director raises questions over what is going on behind the scenes.There are obvious issues there, evenwe don’t really know what’s brought about the decision to part company.The manner of the club in dealing with the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation raised some suspicion a couple of weeks back.It came across as an extreme reaction to a fan group looking to hand over a serious sum of money they had raised.To blacklist them so publicly was a very strange move.That was the first time there had been anything other than positive news coming out of the club since the Ogrens took over.Brannigan’s departure coming so soon afterwards makes it dficult to think anything other than they are linked in some way.Like the rest of the fans, I am on the outside looking in.But it doesn’t seem like everything is as rosy behind the scenes as we’d been led to believe.That doesn’t mean there’s a scandal waiting to be uncovered but a bit of clarity from the club in what’s been going on would be good.Fallings out and disagreements behind the scenes tend to happen when things aren’t going so well on the pitch.That’s what has jarred so much about this past couple of weeks at United.The club are in such a good place, they’ve won the Championship and are gearing up for the Premiership next season.Money has been invested in the first team, the academy and certainly around the stadium.The Ogrens’ reign has been pretty much positive right the way through.The sort of questions this last fortnight has brought about will be unwanted ones from their point of view.It’s certainly not the kind of attention the Americans or those involved with running the club want or need right now.I just hope it’s not an indication there are problems at Tannadice.Until we hear more from the club, all United fans will be concerned about that scenario.Just like everyone , I was keen to hear John Nelms’ viewpoint on the SPFL voting farce last month.I thought he came out of the interview in the Tele very well.I agree with him that Dundee were stuck between a rock and a hard place – being third they would be unlikely to go up in any league reconstruction.Any benefit would be a longer-term thing where they’ll likely be in a good position for promotion to the Premiership in the new set-up.You could feel the frustration in Nelms from his quotes about the position he and Dundee had been left in by the SPFL.I actually felt quite bad for him over the way it had all been handled by the powers-that-be.You could tell he was holding back on what he thought of Inverness and the leaked WhatsApp messages, too!Nelms came across well and made a good point about Rangers – the vote didn’t even concern the Gers directly so why did the fans all go crazy at Dundee The football world never ceases to amaze.Tommy Wright did a great job at St Johnstone – consistently challenging despite not having the budget to really compete with the big boys.I have to say I found the timing of his departure from McDiarmid Park strange.Maybe he’d just had enough of battling away for so long.Technically this season isn’t even over yet. Maybe the shutdown just gave him enough time to think about his future.And the Northern Ireland manager’s gig is available…This week we’ll see what evidence Rangers have on the SPFL over the voting saga. I have to say I’m keen to see what they have – after all this time,it’s nothing major, they’ll be left with egg on faces. months free access to our web and ePaper pack including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/829eebde-d890-49f6-ba68-a783503fccc1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/829eebde-d890-49f6-ba68-a783503fccc1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/829eebde-d890-49f6-ba68-a783503fccc1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/829eebde-d890-49f6-ba68-a783503fccc1-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"stay at home activity packs developed for older people in dundee","story":"Activity packs to keep the elderly across Dundee occupied during lockdown have been developed by support workers.Staff from the Community Mental Health Teams for Older People have selected a number of donated items to create the #Stay at Home, Stay Safe and Have a Cuppy# packs.The packs include seated exercises, seated yoga, word searches, quizzes, colouring pictures and pens, poems, carer stress tips and le story questions.They also contain a coffee sachet, some tea bags and a biscuit to encourage people to make time to do something nice in the day.Over the next  weeks the teams will be distributing new packs with dferent activities every two weeks.Currently the teams have  packs made up which will be shared with service users by delivering them to their doorsteps whilst observing physical distancing measures.Community Mental Health Team Older People East team lead, Christine Davidson, said: “As an occupational therapist I was acutely aware of the impact lockdown could have on our patients and carers.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The beauty and calm of the island made a lasting impression on me.#The monuments of Kilmartin Glen are also at the very heart of the book’s major themes, including kingship and the sacredness of landscape.#And it was at Dunadd that Aidan would have seen the kings of Dál RiataPortals to this other-world still survive, suggested by mountains, forgotten ruins, holy wells and standing stones, crosses and caves, said Mr Connell.Born in Newcastle, he now lives in Cumbria, England, with his partner and their daughter.He previously worked for titles including The Edinburgh Evening News, with bylines in The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday.The book has been published by Culture and Democracy Press and is available to purchase online through Amazon for £."},{"url":null,"title":"national theatre announces new digital programming","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe National Theatre has announced the next two productions to be streamed live on YouTube every Thursday at pm.The screenings are part of National Theatre at Home the new initiative to bring content to the public accessed from their homes during coronavirus.Productions announced today include the NT Live broadcast of Danny Boyle’s production of Frankenstein filmed at the National Theatre in , which sees Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller alternating the roles of Victor Frankenstein and his creation.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering key workers in inveraray","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsInveraray#s war memorial was lit up blue this week in tribute to the work being done by NHS staff and other key workers during the coronavirus crisis.The tribute was organised by Inveraray#s branch of the Royal British Legion Scotland.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall.

But I have lost my job and can’t afford to feed my kids right now.’ You could tell that he was absolutely mortied and so humble. So many people have lost their jobs.“We have told pensioners not to answer their door when we deliver, but one old lady insisted. We told her she shouldn’t be doing that, but she replied: I just want to say thank you’.“The older generation are so apologetic when asking for help, they all say: I’m sorry to bother you’.”Christian charity Via Wings is offering food deliveries and befriending to anyone who is self-isolating, elderly, vulnerable, an NHS employee, key workers, or those financially impacted by Covid-.Volunteers observe social distancing guidelines and food is carefully wiped down before being packed. Food and toiletry donations can be made at Eurospar, Supervalu and Vivo in Dromore and Tescosand Lidl in Banbridge.Via Wings works with local schools and churches, social workers, care workers and other agencies.“Working in unity is what our grandparents used to do, and that is what we need to get back to doing, caring for each other,” Gail added.“There is no ownership, we are just working together.”CASE STUDYNEIL MUSGROVEPicture# NEIL MUSGROVE SUBMITTED BY LEEDS CARESAN ULTRA-MARATHON runner is putting his best foot forward after several running events planned for this year had to be cancelled or postponed.Last year Neil Musgrove ran seven ultra-marathons and with none looking likely for this year he is running one in his back garden.He is doing a mile a day in his back garden according to his running watch and is hoping to reach his goal of the  mile starting distance for an ultra marathon by the end of April.For every mile completed, Neil is donating £ to Leeds Cares and hopes that friends and family will join in with the challenge at their own homes and donate after every mile completed.He said: “With no ultra-marathons to run I thought I’ll run one of my own. Any experience I’ve had with Leeds Hospitals in the past has been positive, I want to support all of our amazing NHS staff who are currently under huge pressure and working in extremely tough circumstances.“It is quite a few laps. All being well this takes me to a  mile ultra marathon distance. Yes it might get a little tedious but I am thinking of it as an ultra with a checkpoint, food and drink at every mile.“My young niece and nephew have already got involved and I’m hoping to get my own kids involved too. I’m sharing the challenge with my colleagues and running club team-mates so hopefully lots of us will get involved. Make it as interesting as you like.

It has to be fully within your own property boundary. If you don’t have a garden, special dispensation is given to use your street but remember the two metre rule.”All funds raised through Neil’s challenge will go towards Leeds Cares’ Support Your NHS Hospitals Appeal and provide vital support to frontline staff at Leeds Teaching Hospitals.This includes, paying for care packages, assistance with travel and accommodation where needed, as well as helping to fund other health and wellbeing initiatives to boost morale across the wards.

Since then, the number of volunteers has hit  although extra help remains welcome.Government guidelines mean the volunteers can leave their homes to help a vulnerable person and, with almost every volunteer already assigned to an inidual, more support is likely to be needed in the weeks ahead.The idea has been well received by those who live in the Stenhousemuir and Larbert areas and beyond, so much so organisers opted to branch out and ease the strain on mums and dads by collecting and distributing school lunches purchased by Larbert High School to youngsters stuck at home.Pupils from Larbert High and its cluster primaries are benefitting from the move.On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than  meals to schoolchildren.Stenny chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, said: “We put out a few requests for further volunteers and the response to each has been really encouraging.“We’re doing one-to-one tasks for people like dog walking and shopping and we’re putting in calls to make sure they’re okay.“The advice was clear:you’re going out for your own shopping,you have to go to work,you’re going out for one bit of exercise oryou’re helping a vulnerable person you’re able to go out, particularly because some people have got nobody .“We have even had members of family from farther afield saying they have a relative in the area and they want to give you a call.“We’re still looking for volunteers as we’re only in week three and the smart money is probably on this being extended for three months. We’ve also expanded out to do school meal deliveries for a number of the schools. Carron Bathrooms got in touch and offered two vans so we now have three. On top of that, we’re doing deliveries for Falkirk Foodbank.”Though Stenny officials admitted concerns over the impact COVID- would have on the club itself, their focus has always been on the “health and well-being” of the community.When the community help initiative was first announced, Mr McMenemy wrote in a statement: “With the continuing spread of the coronavirus, Scottish football faces an uncertain future.“It is quite clear that there will be a signicant impact on football operations and finances and Stenhousemuir Football Club will no doubt be affected by this.“However, there are other, more important matters to think about. The coronavirus is a very serious disease that will affect thousands within our communities.“The health and well-being of friends, neighbours and members of our community should be our top priority.”CASE STUDYHARRY RAGLESSSTAR MAN: Steve in his dramatic outfit.A BOY with spina bida and his father are both doing their bit for the community # but in completely dferent ways.Harry Ragless usually spends  per cent of his time in a wheelchair due to his condition, which means his spine did not form properly in the womb and he has neurological damage to his legs and back and cannot feel his feet.But inspired by the efforts of -year-old war veteran Captain Tom Moore, which have seen him raise around £million for the NHS, Harry decided to raise money by walking with his frame and leg supports.The determined six-year-old from Oaksheath Gardens in Durrington, near Worthing, has raised £, and rising within days of his parents launching a fundraising page for his efforts # smashing his £ target.He said: “I feel really good. I was shocked.”His proud mother Selina Ragless said: “He has shocked us all. Because of his condition he tires easily but the other day he walked from our house to Vancouver Road, which is really far for him. We couldn’t believe it.”As word of his exploits spread, Selina said people were coming out of their homes to applaud Harry, who attends West Park School in Marlborough Road, Goring, when he went out for a walk.She said: “I feel overwhelmed to be honest. We owe the NHS so much they have been there for him since he was born and will be there for him for the rest of his le. If we can give something back, that is all we want.”In fact, Harry’s exploits grabbed the attention of Captain Tom himself # and his picture was featured on the Second World War veteran’s Instagram page.Harry is not the only person in his family who is raising a smile in the community.By day, his dad Steve is a warehouse manager # but during his daily walk, he dons his Stars Wars outfit to bring a bit of fun to the neighbourhood. The -year-old said: “I love it. From my own experience, I remember the first Comic-Con I went to in Birmingham and I saw all these stormtroopers standing outside, and I went into full fanboy mode.”The opportunity for him to get his own suit arose when a friend was selling theirs.He said: “When I finally put it on, I just felt amazing in it. I love seeing the looks and smiles, and people tooting their car horns and waving. It brings a few smiles in these very strange times.”Selina came up with the idea for him to wear it after they were put in lockdown, and during their walks around the estate Steve has posed for ‘socially-distant’ photos with some of the children who have come out to see him.In his spare time, Steve has donned the costume to a iety of events, including birthday parties, weddings and charity events.When the Connaught Cinema has done showings of Star Wars films, Steve has turned up in his gear to raise money for Sussex Association for Spina Bida and Hydrocephalus, a charity which has helped Harry.When askedthere was anything he wanted to say to the people who have donated so far to his campaign, Harry said: “Thank you.”To donate, visit justgiving. com fundraising selina-ragless.Nominate a community heroDo YOU know a volunteer who deserves to be recognised for making a change in their community The Prime Minister recognises one person a day with a Point of Light award.Read more or nominate someone at www.pointsoflight.gov.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"sad ending for ardfern","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPuffer enthusiast and reader David Wright, who grew up in Bellanoch and now lives in Largs, sent in this photograph of the #Ardfern# puffer taken in the early s.Ardfern sank entering the canal locks at Crinan.

We felt there must be another way to help high risk groups.\"Equally, local businesses were worried about the virus affecting their trade. In order to help sustain all aspects of our community, wersquove tried to take a broad approach.One solution was the creation of the first Newstead Village Newsletter ndash a simple, four-page leaflet which included useful information and several helpline numbers. ldquoMelrose shops offering home deliveries were also included in the newsletter, says Lisa. ldquoWe put the information online but that excluded those without internet access. So, a printed version delivered to every home was essential.Local Volvo dealer John Cleland kindly offered to take care of the printing, while Gala Le said they would deliver.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions. If the alternative arrangements are not covered, a chargeback would normally be successful.

The residential units are shown to be laid out in such a way that adheres to the normally accepted privacy and amenity criteria on overlooking and overshadowing, whilst affording the future occupants of the residential units an appropriate level of privacy and residential amenity.Access to the new development would come from Fall Avenue and James Kirk Way.A design and access statement included within the planning application notes meetings had taken place with ious local authority departments in a bid to address ious design requirements.It concludes: ldquoOverall, it is considered that the final design creates a well-considered, proportionate design that responds to the site constraints and the nearby area to create a positive design solution.ldquoThe result is a development that will make a positive contribution socially, economically and aesthetically to the area and enhance the amenity of existing and future residents within this area.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council stressed they ldquowelcomed comments from community councils.She said: ldquoIn this case, we consulted the community council back in December, and they submitted a response detailing a number of concerns.ldquoThese included concerns over house type and layout, increased vehicle movement and parking space provision.ldquoWhilst we understand that consultees may be frustrated when planning authorities do not always agree with their comments, we must balance these comments against the other material considerations of each case.ldquoIn the case of the Hallhill application, our conclusion was that, subject to the imposition of conditions, the proposed development was acceptable.Thank you for reading this story.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

In many places, Hitler was burnt in effigy.On the Tuesday, Prime Minister Winston Churchill addressed the nation at pm by radio, to say the war with Germanywas finally at an end, but the fighting was not yet over.ldquoWe may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing, said Mr Churchill, ldquobut let us not forget for a moment the toil and efforts that lie ahead.ldquoJapan with all her treachery and greed remains unsubdued. The injury she has inflicted on Great Britain, the United States, and other countries, and her destestable cruelties call for justice and retribution. We must now devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our task both at home and abroad.At pm King George VI took to the airwaves. ldquoGermany, who drove all Europe into war, he said, ldquohas been finally overcome, but ldquoin the Far East we have yet to deal with the Japanese, a determined and cruel foe.

But when the workers arrived, they found closed doors. The celebrations could begin. Across the city, bakers had worked until the small hours to ensure there would be enough bread to go around.In articles, The Herald charted the course of Hitlerrsquos war and the Alliesrsquo magnicent response. Scotlandrsquos impressive record in war production was also singled out for praise, from the iron and steel industry to the shipyards on the Clyde and on the east coast.The war against Japan would rage for another three months.

It is better known as a way of cocooning infants through the immunisation of close family members against disease.The team from Edinburgh University, Imperial College London, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have modelled a range of scenarios to illustrate how dferent restrictions could be applied to dferent groups.They show \"the effects on the epidemic curve of a gradual ramping up of protection for the vulnerable population and a gradual ramping down of restrictions on the non-vulnerable population over a period of  weeks after lockdown\"Their findings have been made available to the UK and Scottish Governments.The strategy involves segmenting the population into dferent risk groups, based on a personrsquos medical history and potential healthcare needs.: Scotlands death rate from Covid likely to be lower than rest of UK due to lockdown timingAs a result, younger healthy adults and children, as well as over-s without any ailments associated with an increasedrisk from Covid,would resume something closer to normal le.Those most at risk - who currently fall within the shielded category - would continue to stay at home, with the added safeguard of targeted virus screening.They write: \"Intensive screening would, ideally, include daily checks for symptoms, daily tests for virus presence , regular serological [antibody] testing and monitoring of frequent contactsof shielders.\"If too large fraction of the population were to be classied as lsquoshieldersrsquo this would quickly overwhelm current testing capacity in the UK.\"Nonetheless, routine rapid testing of shielders could have a signicant impact and further increase the scope for relaxing restrictions on the entire population.\"Researchers say lockdown restrictions could be eased for most people, as long as sufficient public health measures stay in place to keep transmission rates low.These would include self-isolation of people with Covid-, quarantining affected households, contact tracing and voluntary social distancing.The most vulnerable ndash the frail elderly and those with underlying medical conditions such as cancer, heart or respiratory diseasesndash would still need to be shielded from contact with anyone potentially infected with the virus.To achieve this, people sharing a house with a vulnerable person, care workers and health professionals would need to protect themselves from infection.However, the risk to the rest of the population could be managed without resorting to lockdown.Asked about a potential \"two-tier approach\" to leaving lockdown, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said policymakers had to weigh up \"the fairness or potential unfairness\" of any approach.\"Is it fair  The judgement might be yes, it is, because we cant allow the quest for perfection to be the enemy of good progress. But we have to think about these things.\"None of us want to have a two-tier or a multi-tier society.\"The study stresses that the general non-shielding population will continue to be the \"main reservoir of infection\", therefore surveillance measures to contain the spread of the virus will be essential, say the researchers.They write: \"It is therefore vital that transmission rates are kept as low as possible, eventhis population is allowed to exit lockdown.\"Measures including self-isolation of cases, quarantining of affected households, contact tracing and voluntary physical distancing will be necessary to achieve this.\"In all our scenarios the vulnerable segment is subject to increased protection indefinitely. [Segmenting and shielding] is also more likely to succeedthere is less or no relaxation of restrictions on shielders.\"They say that contact tracing can include \"both traditional and app-based\" methods.However, the researchers caution that not enough is known about the build-up of immunity in affected populations and stress that this aspect of the epidemic needs to be monitored very closely.Dr Bram van Bunnik, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Edinburghrsquos Usher Institute, said: ldquoEasing the measures taken during the lockdown is important as they currently have a tremendous effect on our society, but this should only be done in a way that is both safe for the people that are most vulnerable as well as for the health and safety of NHS staff.\"Segmentation and shielding is a possible way of achieving this: measures could be eased for a large proportion of the population, however the vulnerable population likely still needs to be protected for a prolonged period."},{"url":null,"title":"years-economic-scarring-predicted-young-workers","story":"A report published today by think tank The Resolution Foundation estimates that

thousands of young people likely to be affected, the Foundation is calling for the government to ensure apprentice schemes are boosted, and have recommended a fund to allow people to stay in education

university and college, so it is easier for people to stay on for up to six months to boost their education and skills.Kathleen Henehan, research and policy analyst at the think thank, said: ldquoThe

than a third, even years down the line when the direct economic effects of the crisis willhave abated.ldquoFor those managing to find work, pay is expected to be depressed as well: two years on from leaving education, real hourly graduate pay is forecast to be, on average,  % lower.ldquoFor leavers with mid- and lower-level qualications, average hourly pay is forecast to be  and  per cent lower

recessions have left cohorts of lsquocrisis leaversrsquo with substantial scarring effect [in] both employment and pay...the depth of that scarring could be even worse this time around, given expectations for how the labour market will perform over the coming months.Alex Beer, welfare programme manager at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the research, said: ldquoThe effects of the COVID- crisis are exacerbating existing inequalities and we are pleased to be funding this analysis which highlights risks to young peoplersquos job prospects.ldquoIt is important that the Government,

Could we get the website sorted so that people get the information that they need, rather than thinking that in order to get a test they have to first get a plane or a ferry ”Responding, the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, said: “It’s a very important question and I’ll look into the specics of it to make sure that our island communities get the appropriate response in the website. He’ll appreciate that we put the testing website together at a remarkable pace and so in the first iteration weren’t able to make this sort of important nuance for Orkney and island communities, but I’ll take that away and look at it.“He mentioned the answer to this in substance and the answer is to get the home testing kits working for Orkney [and Shetland] and I’m sure there’s a way through.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“I am glad that action will be taken to get this issue sorted. If key workers in the isles are not getting the testing that they need because they are getting inaccurate advice from official websites, that puts more people at risk and harms public confidence.“Island communities could benefit greatly from more access to home testing kits for key workers.

It was announced yesterday that the Scottish Government would pass this funding along in full to Scottish councils.Council leaders appealed to the Scottish Government through COSLA, which represents local authorities in Scotland, to give the funding directly to Scottish councils immediately to help them provide essential services at a time when costs are increasing signicantly and income has dropped substantially due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking following yesterday#s announcement, councillor Stockan said: “The announcement from the Scottish Government has shown the value in council leaders working on a common cause together at a time of crisis to press the Scottish Government to give us the support we so badly need and deserve. The government’s eventual decision to bow to our pressure and pass this money on is a signicant victory for local government.“Much more support is needed for local services from the Scottish Government though. There is more funding that should be available to us and we will continue to fight for that. Local councils are facing unprecedented dficulties. The costs of providing key services is rising and yet our income is dropping – an effect of the current crisis is being felt keenly in Orkney.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Russell’s comments come in the wake of the First Minister’s announcement of an expansion of testing.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “There is an increasing level of public interest in the proposals put forward by Professor Pennington and Dr Allyson Pollock in recent weeks that the islands could start to ease lockdown restrictions sooner than mainland Scotland.“Such a strategy could only be adopted, however,a rigorous and extensive system of testing, tracing and isolating was firmly established. The First Minister’s announcement today of a further expansion of testing perhaps paves the way for such a system being put in place.“Public safety, of course, remains the priority and must underpin any decision taken in relation to how and when restrictions are eventually lted. That is true of our island communities as it is other parts of the country.“However, ministers must not discount possible options without proper consideration. I therefore welcome Mr Russell’s assurances that the government will engage actively and constructively in the debate about whether and how our islands might safely take the lead.“This is unlikely to lead to any quick decisions, not least as the stakes are so high. It is encouraging, however, that Ministers are prepared to keep an open mind over the coming week.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However I have no idea how I can add my contribution. Ryan can you help me out here and publish the link in the Shetland Times mailto:NTIMailbox@ofgem.gov.ukIt is not unreliablestored. This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist.Nuclear Energy does have its dangerous pitfalls, but we are already using this technology to generate electricity. I believe % of our electricity is produced by nuclear power  In France I believe this to be much higher  Although it may be dficult to assess the impact of solar or wind generators on the environment on a large scale, it would have to be balanced between the use of such technology to this of the environmental and eco-systems which maybe affected.I do not know how much land would be required to provide electricity to a city of several million, but I would hazard a guess it would be quite considerable  This use would also have to compete with farming and agriculture not to mention living space for housing etc etc.  from the shore would these wind turbines be  I suspect it would be quite close  Will our seashores be lined up with thousands of wind turbines I would also suspect the cost of such a scenario would be very high in adoption and maintenance.lol Hayden. Disturbing as it may be, I do not think we will have much option but to go nuclear. If it were a case of saving the environment and eco-systems, one may not have any choice We are already using this technology to produce electricity, andit is the case of minimizing our impact on the environment and eco-systems, then nuclear maybe the only way Cleaner energy may be, morally, more suited, but one must also take into consideration the impact on the environment and eco-systems and how this may change towards a negative once we realize the full influence of this compared to the potential benefits I cannot give any answers to what a large scale wind or solar scheme would be to power several millions homes, but I would suspect it would be considerably large in land area  One could use the same land for agriculture and farming and possibly housing  Shetland is suited for wind generating power schemes, but what would be the benefits to this of tourism, bird populations and property values, not to mention the visual impact of those people living near to such schemes and the consistent vibrating noise.Agriculture, farming and housing would not be adversely affected. Bird populations would be safe and tourists would be able to concentrate on spending their money which, after all, is the main reason for encouraging them to visit Shetland!! By the way,I have stood close to wind fed generators of the type we are discussing and never felt vibrations —- just the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades. Not too dferent from the soothing sounds of the sea.Haydn, You live in Crickhowell, Wales, nowhere near any large windfarms.The Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons on your doorstep. Just how close is your home to the #the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades  .# I really doubtyou can even see a -meter turbine from your home. On Shetland people would be living under them, they would be about  meters high on high hills  meters or so plus above our heads!!! The plan is for over.Another smaller series of wind turbines is even closer to me and they are sited near Ebbw Vale on The Tops as we in the lower valley area call them. From close first hand experience I still maintain that the swishing sound of the blades is pleasant and certainly not as fierce and noisyas anyof the many gale force winds on Shetland.Or does that apply just to those who are incomers from other places like England for example Where do you hale from Ian  Just wondering !Llanfoist is just a walk from Crickhowell, I walk that distance most days!!! !!

Those users will then be sent advice, including how to get a test.The app is hoped to ramp up contact tracing and reduce the spread of the virus.Mr Dickson said it  was an important part of the strategy # and he felt the Isle of Wight pilot could have useful implications for Shetland, which shares some similarities, as an island community.Although the Isle of Wight is closer to the mainland and has a larger population, it has a single health board and Mr Dickson said it faced many of the same challenges as Shetland.In order to be effective, however, the app needs a signicant proportion of the population to sign-up, which could pose dficulties in isolated communities such as Shetland, where connectivity is poor in some areas.There have also been concerns raised about data privacy.But Mr Dickson said he was optimistic that folk in Shetland would support the programmeand when it was rolled out locally.#I#ve always found the people of Shetland to be hugely positive at responding to these sorts of challenges,# he said.#I#ve got no doubt that they will do the same here.#Until the app is rolled out more widely, however, Shetland#s contact tracing programme will be along the traditional  methodology.#Right now the digital  is not available for us,# said Mr Dickson. # So it#s back to the grind stone and the hard work of checking where people have been.#Nationally, , staff have been recruited to help with the manual checking of people#s movements, as an alternative tracing programme for those who do not have access to a smartphone or good connectivity.Mr Dickson said that in Shetland, health workers who have been unable to perform their usual work, due to the Covid- crisis, such as dentists, would be ready to help with the programme.But although Mr Dickson said it was possible to carry out this method of contact tracing effectively in Shetland, he said it would be a #Herculean# task to do it on a national level requiring an estimated , staff.With the digital , he said much of that need for labour could be reduced.But while the contact tracing is a useful step forward, Mr Dickson said it must be considered as part of a wider picture.#I think it#s a really useful string to the bow of the wider orchestra that we need to overcome this,# he said.He highlighted the NHS#s work helping care homes and delivering PPE as other ongoing parts of its work fighting the virus. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"survey to study lockdown travel behavours ","story":"ZetTrans, Shetland’s regional transport partnership, wants to hear from residents about how lockdown has affected sustainable travel behaviour across the isles, and to understand what the long-term implications might be.Public engagement to support development of an active travel strategy for Shetland was cut short earlier this year, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions.Transport and policy projects officer Robina Barton said ZetTrans would like to thank all those who took part in the March events and online engagement.She said: “A new online questionnaire aims to capture any positive changes in travel behaviours as a result of lockdown.“Perhaps you have been exercising or making your essential journeys on foot or by bike.

But with no likelihood of visitors coming to our place anytime soon, there is something slightly morose and sad about making the buildings and cabins look neat, well maintained and tidy.It all seems a bit soulless and Marie Celeste-like with no guests.While being locked down at home, being busy, fixing and decorating, and even dare I say it, having a good time with family, there is an emerging sense of frustration, even perhaps inadequacy.Others are out there being essential, being key workers and worthwhile, ‘fighting’ the virus, supporting the vulnerable, while I….make a patio.I think for many people, there is a need to feel useful, and it is perhaps why for me the motorbike ride is so important.While there is nothing heroic about delivering a few medicines, it gets me out of the house # we might have a big cabin, but it still induces a fever.Being part of a support network and involved in helping the community works both ways and fulfils a very real need in those helping.Perhaps everybody wants to feel essential.We can laud the NHS staff, care workers, shop assistants and delivery drivers, but no one is going to clap for the furloughed hospitality workers and idle outdoor instructors.As a volunteer, however, we can all feel that we are doing our bit.There is a huge grey area surrounding the concept of key worker and essential.At first glance, it may seem obvious as to who is key # doctors, nurses, carers and the like but then there are the people who support them.Key workers need paid, so require office staff. They need fed, so also use food shops.They need to get to work, so are likely to drive a vehicle, so they need fuel. Andthe car breaks down, they will need a mechanic.They need water and electricity and the internet, and might also need a treat delivered from a mail order company during their well-deserved down time.Then there are the people who support the people who support the people who support…and so on.And so there emerges a whole network of service providers, businesses large and small # a web of commerce and production.In order to provide for the frontline, a whole system of interrelated businesses exists, many which might not appear to be essential, but may provide a key element, a small cog in the big picture.In the short term key workers can perhaps get by, but society shouldn’t allow its critical people to just muddle through, as the lockdown period extends, then the need for this support becomes more evident and relevant, and so the web of essentiality widens.As more roles, jobs and links in society are realised and considered necessary, and indispensability spreads, recreation and tourism won’t get much of a look in.We could argue that people need to visit the Old Man of Storr for our economic well-being as much as for their own health and well-being, but for the time being the beds and hot spots will remain empty.So, in order to be relevant and useful, we should perhaps look to our other skills.If tourism is our only income then we have to be creative, not only to make provision but to keep spirit and self-actualisation alive.Economically,tourism is a second income, the icing on the salaried or pensioned cake, then perhaps we just take the hit, and revert back to a less affluent lestyle.Many tourist providers left skills and talents in a previous le, perhaps now is the time to revisit and reimagine those skills.As I understand it, Skye is still waiting.Perhaps by the time this column is online, the virus will be more evident, during this waiting game now more than ever we need to be physically distant, and careful with how we operate.But it is crucial that we also need to look after our mental health and well-being, and so delivering the prescriptions is really as important to volunteer as it is for the receiver.Humans are a social animal, and we need to be part of a community, because we are all essential.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/norrie-grandfather.jpg","title":"norrie t macdonald the cycle of the sea and island traditions of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAlthough Shinigeadh was our training pool as youngstersand probably today seems quite safe and relatively innocuous it was also my first introduction to the concept of ‘industrial’ fishing.was strictly for deployment only by the stronger adults.It consisted of a stf polefrom which was slung a netted hoop, around - feet in diameter.It was to our mini-bamboo rods, what the Broch purse-seiner was to the Scalpay ring-netter.There had obviously been a couple of nights where our amateur, one-at-a-time, efforts to procure a decent supper had been insufficient to adequately harvest the bounty on offer.I remember the bodach and both the uncles appearing with the borrowed ‘poc’, intrigued as to what purpose it could possibly serve.’.A couple of pocketfuls of just-about-right, newly boiled, potatoes were the secret weapon.The cuddies scattered as the ‘poc’ got lowered into the sea.Crushing a potato into small pieces and scattering on the surface elicited a frenzy of activity.The timing of the hauling of the ‘poc’ was crucial.A miss, and you could maybe only land a couple.A full hit and you might struggle to lt it out of the water at all, requiring a re-submersion.This could result in losing the lot, the elusive cuddy being much quicker than the second haul.It took the knotting of the legs and sleeves of one of the standard, adult, blue boiler suits to make a receptacle big enough to take that night’s catch home.It was the first time I observed the tradition of the ‘share’.Walking back through the village, it was like we were expected.Several caileachs came to their gate with a basin, each the recipient of half a dozen dozen fish, dependent on their familysize.It was a tradition Iain ‘Scud’ MacLeod, George ‘Baba’ Richards and myself continued as we graduated onto the big bamboo in Bayble School.They were my fishing buddies as we moved onto the next level in our adventures.The full bamboo rod required technique and balance.Especially when we moved further afield onto the more dficult fishing hot-spots. every night.We were careful not to take the prime spots lest we got a mouthful, but we were tutored and encouraged, warned about any pitfalls and certainly well chaperoned for our own education and safety.We moved further up towards the Tiumpan where the rocks were more daunting, each climb steeper and requiring a working knowledge of the way down.With a -foot pole and in wellies.’ were the favourites, not too tricky a climb and with deep water just off the inside-point. were reserved for night when we felt particularly brave or even simply when they hadn’t been claimed by the adults.They were prime locations, great fishing spots, but generally could only accommodate a single rod.’ were up at the Tiumpan itself and required the right combination of tides and prevailing wind to be accessible, safe and productive. .The big rod came with several dferent options.The flywhich mimicked sand eels, consisted of usually three, four or six hooks, depending on what you were after .It could be deployed with, or without, a weight on the end.’was an issue.In the deeper water, a ‘dandy’ was best. This involved far less effort, a simple up and down motion of the tip of the rod producing plentul yields.’, basin outstretched, every night we caught more than was our fill.We also, as we got more adventurous, took to a bigger, single, hook and a longer, single trace .Barring this, a rubber eel.We were moving up from cuddy to lythe.What a fright the first one gave me!Two pulls of almighty force, then ‘I give up’.Deadweight.The sense of yet another ‘graduation’ was palpable, but the lythe was no grand fighting fish.It marked another progression up whatever the fishing ‘ladder’ was.By this time we were regulars in the town and had had our introduction to Meg’s ‘Electro Sports’ shop.He had, to our limited experience anyway, a huge assortment of rods and tackle for us to gawp at.Naturally, we moved up to spinning rods, monofilament, lures, kosters and paternosters., in competitions to see who could be the first to ,  or even .Traumatised for an hour or so, they would get ed to the water as the sun began to set.With spinning rods we learned a completely dferent set of rules.What was deep  yards out and what was disaster for your tackle.How to tie a proper knot and which kit worked best for the conditions.How to unravel a reel-tangle with three mackerel on the line .The cost of losing gear was beginning to hit the pocket-money hard.The only real solution was to get better at making your own.You learned how to make your own trace # downy seagull feathers were better, but not as practical as sheep’s wool # and how to tie knots that never ‘slipped’.Graduating onto more ‘specialist’ fish and fishing became a challenge after years of cuddies, mackerel and lythe.Fancier bait lugworm, real sand eel, salted herring even, were meant to be great to entice the bottom feeders flounder, sole, gurnard, possibly haddock and lingyou could reach with a long cast.Ok, so we mostly caught dogfish and, like every single other thing we pulled up, handling one came with its own set of rules.Mackerel have a nasty wee ‘sting’ in front of their anal fin, a small protrusion of cartilage bone which can catch the unwary out.Gurnard require welding gloves and a lesser-spotted dogfish will try to wrap its tail around your arm and give you a nasty ‘Chinese burn’.Rub your fingers against the ‘grain’ of one’s scales next time you see one.It’s like rough sandpaper.Everyone’s ambition, however, was to get out on one of the village boats.We had grown up with Roddy Alec and ‘Saight’, the last proper village fishermen who plied their trade on the ‘Fisher Lass’ out of Portnaguran.The ‘Fisher Lass’ was a substantial wooden boat, somewhere between the privately owned ‘rowing’ boats # each one now had a Seagull, Mariner or Evinrude rather than rely on such menial propulsion # and the commercial trawlers.Hers was a serious purpose we just wanted some fun.Whilst the rocks could disappoint, we were brought up with the notion that being a quarter mile offshore must come with an assurance of plenty.There were boats on the Portvoller side as well.The trick was, in the absence of having a boat in the family, knowing someone who did and whose father uncle was prepared to take responsibility for you for a couple of hours.Three a side, with mackerel or herring running, was huge entertainment.It was, necessitated by space and safety, ato hand lines again and a degree of ‘back to basics’ which felt very raw..A fish meal factory, dependent mostly on locally caught sand eels, but which handled mackerel and pout when available it could stink out the entire town given the right conditions.My father would come home, not entirely fragrant, and I would rush to get the folded-up daily paper from his lunch box.There were days, especially in the height of summer, when I couldn’t get beyond the back page .Little did I realise, until many years later, the destruction caused by overfishing of the type to assault the senses so violently..Barryhad procurement of his uncle’s boat and we made an anchor out of an old engine, attached a buoy and plastic ring, then ran yds of mm, in a loop, to the shore.The rest, you might say, is piracy.All good fun until the fishery cruiser, possibly the ‘Minna’, I couldn’t comment, came along one morning and confiscated the net, cod ‘n’ all.Now this could have been a delicious irony.I referred last week to the passing down of genes through the generations.The son and ‘heir to fresh air’ was never a guy to show his hand early, certainly not while in school.We had no clue what career path he would decide on, his head, whilst not always in proximity, wascertainly edging closer to the clouds.“I’m going to sea Da, to do marine engineering”, he one day boldly announced.Luckily, no one had a feather handy.And that’s what he did.He qualied as a ship’s engineer.It shouldn’t have been too hard to figure out where this notion came from, however., MacIver was the Chief Engineeron the old Fishery Protection Vessel, “Minna”.It is indeed a tangled web.Years later I ended up, standing on several fish boxes in the mart in Stornoway, as a fish-salesman.In my apprenticeship, under George Prince Jnr, we oversaw the landing of tens of thousands of tonnes of sand eels to HBP.The fishery was devastated, almost entirely, by local vessels and a couplefrom Barra.But while the smell was awful, the money was fantastic for all those involved.As the years progressed, the main catch moved from fish to prawns.I could tell the dference between a dab, a plaice, a brill, a turbot, a halibut, a megrim and a witch, but saw increasinglyless and less of them each year.My good pal Stuart Keyte – the local fishery officer # and I bought a small, Orkney origin, ‘clinker’-built -footer to work some creels and have a bit of ploy.You can get used to two lobsters for breakfast.But only for a wee while.Despite HBP closing down and the fishery banned, the knock-on effects of overfishing, several stocks over several decades, were beginning to take their toll.I could go to the rocks for nights on end and catch nothing.As it was, I ended up on the rocks anyway.A spell clam fishing with John Murdo ‘Easdaidh’ MacLeod was my swan song.I loved it.We left the harbour every day at am and headed for, guess where Correct, the Tiumpan.As day broke we would haul the six dredges and he would get the frying pan on whilst I sorted the catch.I could see the lights in my house going on from half a mile at sea .We had two rolls each and a cup of coffee.A huge scallop, bacon, black-pudding and fried egg on each .“If they fit through the handle of the basket, throw them over” was the rule of thumb.I’m guessing we could have been inside ‘the limit’.I’ve never fished a Loch nor a river.Not remotely interested.Given my track record, I’d have probably used a bit of dynamite, certainly a bit of mono.Just for dramatic effect.Mother Nature, left to her own devices, is a truly wonderful thing.Stocks will, eventually, recover and, managed properly could give sustainable employment for years to come.Maybe even endless fun for kids who have got too accustomed and fed up, paralysed even, from the catatonic effects of lockdown.Remember what Dougie said to Para Handy ‘The herring in Loch Fyne comes in cycles’‘Ach man’, replied Macfarlane, ‘There wass herring in the Loch long afore the cycle was inventit’.Everything goes around folks.Remember it when you contemplate your next move.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh an gobha ruadh agus domhnall an oir","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine..

We also reached out to our friends in Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William Flute Band and were delighted to be able to work with them to distribute over  care packages to some of the most vulnerable members of our community.Obviously thanks must go to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council for providing the grant and for the extremely fast turnaround throughout the application process, the club would also like to thank Maurice Cooper and the Ballee Discount Shop for helping us source the products. Thanks also must go to Galgorm LOL  who allowed us the use of their hall to make up the packages.But a huge amount of thanks and credit must go to the members of the club and the band for their attitude and desire to help their community despite the ongoing situation.It has been extremely encouraging to see so many examples of the loyal orders and bands coming to the forefront to help their communities and it serves to prove that our Institutions and Associations are about much more than parades!Mervyn Stirling, Bandmaster of Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William said: When we were first contacted by the club about the idea we agreed to it right away.We as a band had been trying to help our members and their families as best we could but this enabled us to take that level of support to another level. When distributing the care packages it was very apparent how grateful and appreciative people were, even just for us as a band to be thinking of them.Its not until youre on the ground can you fully appreciate just how isolated some people are during this period, so for us as a band to be able to help those people is fantastic.Wed just like to express our thanks to Ballymena and Harryville Apprentice Boys of Derry branch club for reaching out to us and giving us the opportunity to help our community.I think it shows perfectly what bands and loyal orders are all about, and thats helping their communities and being there for one another.

They will be stepping out as one of the teams take part in a virtual walking challenge organised by Health and Social Care lecturer, Kate Pegram. Each team has a target of walking a combined total of  miles – completed as part of their daily exercise routine – the distance between the College’s campuses in Coleraine, Ballymoney, Ballymena, Newtownabbey and Magherafelt.Jenny Small, Vice Principal, Performance and Development, who is overseeing the Volunteer Day explained: “Northern Regional College is rooted in a deep culture of corporate social responsibilityand community partnership. Throughout the academic year, we encourage our students and staff to participate in activities that raise awareness and funds for nominated charities. Our usual fundraising activities have been put on hold because of the lockdown but the College’s commitment to achieving its CSR objectives remains as strong as ever. “We designated May  as a COVID- Volunteer Day to support staff members wanting to help their local community, as well as recognising and celebrating the many outstanding volunteering efforts already taking place.“Adapting to online learning and home working as the new normal has been challenging and we realise that anyone looking after vulnerable relatives and neighbours or home schooling their children won’t have much spare time but we wanted to support staff who want to do something to help but perhaps haven’t had an opportunity to do so yet.”She continued: “As we are all in this together, we felt designating a specic Volunteer Day was a way to give everyone working in the College an opportunity to spend some of their time that day helping those who are most vulnerable. We have a strong and mutually supportive relationship with communities around our campuses so this is our chance to give something back. It’s also our way of saying ‘thank you’ to the amazing frontline workers - many are past or present students of the College - across a wide range of sectors and services.”Many staff are already involved in volunteering and fundraising activities. Kyle Leckey, Health and Safety Co-ordinator, ran . miles, the equivalent of a marathon, around his neighbourhood and raised pound, for FareShareNI, while Social Care lecturer Jacqui McAllister has been working weekends as a healthcare assistant in the COVID ward at Antrim Area Hospital and donating her wages for COVID- research. Child Care lecturers at the Newtownabbey campus have been knitting, crocheting and painting to raise funds for the Friends of the Cancer Centre, as well as producing handmade mask attachments for frontline workers in hospitals. Cheryl McNeil, Business Engagement Officer who also runs Debut Dance Company as a social enterprise, has developed a series of seated and armchair based exercise videos for distribution to residential care homes. The College plans to maintain its volunteering efforts and it’s COVID- Volunteer Response Group, under the leadership of Irvine Abraham, will continue to generate ideas about the best way to supporting support local communities impacted by the pandemic.A wide iety of volunteering activities are planned for Thursday, May  including volunteering at local foodbanks, doing shopping and chores for elderly neighbours, donating blood, producing items of PPE, baking and cooking for vulnerable neighbours and supporting telephone helplines. While many staff will be working in teams to complete the virtual walking challenge between campuses, some are opting for more strenuous physical challenges, and a brave hearted few, at the risk of wearing out the stair carpets, are even planning to scale the equivalent of Mount Everest indoors.

We might not even be able to stay together in the same country, let alone get married.The young couple, who have been together for over two years, met while teaching English in South Korea.Jason revealed that he is here in Northern Ireland on a fiance visa which requires him to get legally married before August .If the marriage does not take place, he cannot extend his stay or switch to a spousal visa and remain in the UK, meaning that their whole future will be thrown into question.Furthermore, Louise has had no income since February, as the new job she was supposed to start as a support worker in Northern Ireland cannot train her due to Covid-.Although she is still technically employed, her employer cannot pay her, as she cannot start work.Louise, an only child to support worker dad Hughand nurse Lorraine , who are both retired, said she is not entitled to Jobseeker#s Allowance or to Universal Credit.The pair said they have emailed the Home Office but, after almost three weeks, there has been no reply. They also said they cannot get through to officials by phone either.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseLouise Murray from Carrickfergus and her fiancé Jason Charewicz from Massachusetts FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappLouise Murray from Carrickfergus and her fiancé Jason Charewicz from MassachusettsJason told the Belfastthat the two of them were now in despair over their future.The longer our marriage is delayed the more likely it is that we won#t meet the financial requirement of the spousal visaone month of no income becomes three through no fault of our own, he said. If the pandemic hadn#t happened, we would be getting married in May, and Louise#s income over the previous year would exceed the financial requirement that the Home Office stipulates.Louise cannot, however, make income due to the pandemic, and now it looks like this will bring us below the threshold, despite the fact that Louise made well over the required threshold in the past two years.The Home Office requires the partner of the foreign visa applicant to prove their previous year#s income using the past  months.But whatthree of those  months# earning potential were lost by an unforeseen virus The decision to relocate from the Far East to Northern Ireland was the result of Louise#s preference to come home.I didn#t want to live in America, she explained.That meant Jason was prepared to leave his parents Michaeland Deborahand younger brother Brettbehind in the US to make a new le with his Northern Irish love.Jason said they believe that couples in their situation should be allowed to use the  months before the coronavirus pandemic in order to prove the sponsor#s income.He also pointed out that it has already cost them at least £, to get this far in the legalisation process.When my visa comes to expire, and we have had no chance to get legally married due to the pandemic, will the Home Office require that we spend thousands of pounds again on a new application, despite the fact that this one was made null and void by a pandemic  he said.Will they send me back to the States without my partner, where I haven#t lived for years Jason also hit out at the lack of advice from the UK Government on the issue. What does the government suggest we do  he said.They won#t release any advice about this specic situation.It#s inconvenient that British couples must delay their marriage, but for couples where one partner#s status rests on a legal marriage taking place, the lockdown is devastating.He added: We just want answers.Louise said: Not knowing is almost worse than having a bad answer because at least then you could make plans.In response the Home Office said it has put in place a range of measures to support those affected by the Covid- outbreak.  We continue to monitor the situation closely and take these exceptional circumstances into account, a spokesman said.Under current family Immigration Rules, a fiance or proposed civil partner can apply to extend their stay for a further six months where there is good reason why their ceremony could not take place during the currency of their visa.”Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I am concerned that the debate on the future of the lockdown is getting ahead of itself.It is getting ahead of the reality people are still facing.It would pile tragedy upon tragedyNorthern Ireland lost its way at this stage.Mr Swann urged the public to stick to the guidelines to keep saving lives and protect the NHS.We have a long way to go yet. This is no time for bailing out or doing your own thing, We must stick to social distancing. We can#t lose our way.We don#t want to look back in the future with regret, said Mr Swann. Earlier yesterday, figures released by the Department of Health confirmed that Northern Ireland#s coronavirus death toll has now reached .Six people died in the previous  hours, with a further  deaths occurring outside this period but only being reported yesterday.A further  people tested positive for the virus, bringing the total number of people infected here to ,.New figures have also suggested the UK coronavirus death toll of , is now the highest in Europe, overtaking , deaths in Italy.Meanwhile, the number of deaths in the Republic of Ireland has risen to , after a further  deaths were announced yesterday.The Republic has already published its own timetable for exiting the lockdown, while Stormont ministers are due to meet tomorrow to review regulations. But Mr Swann said putting dates on changes to the regulations leads people into the  sense of security.During the next period of time, we will not be ing to what we knew as being normal. There will be a new normal in Northern Ireland for a long period of time while we get Covid- under control, he added. Addressing the briefing, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said there was a long way to go yet before the crisis passed and it was important people don#t regret their actions during the Covid- pandemic. Dr McBride said careful planning was needed before any decisions could be made, while social distancing would also have to continue alongside good respiratory and hand hygiene. He added that a number of things were certain, including that people who could work from home would have to continue to do so.Dr McBride acknowledged that the stay-at-home order was extremely dficult and causing social and economic issues but he said the reproductive number of the virus had to be kept below one or there would be an exponential rise in new cases. Dr McBride confirmed plans to ramp up contact tracing and that discussions were ongoing with colleagues in the Republic of Ireland and UK around digital s for doing so.He said % of cases would need to be identied within  hours for the plan to be effective. Dr McBride also urged people not to break the restrictions during the upcoming bank holiday.People are tired and we have a number of weeks to go yet before we are in a position where I believe the evidence suggests that it would be safe to step down any of these measures without seeing that R numberincrease and us getting back to that situation that we had an exponential growth.Dr McBride called for mature and respectful discussion with the public and said that now is not the time for confusion around the easing of measures when it was not yet safe to do so.We just need to ensure that we don#t give mixed messages. I would be reluctant to put in place an articial time frame for those decisions prematurely.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We#ve been told what we have to do.Stopping air travel is not going to stop the spread of the virus - the virus is already here, he said.The logical conclusion of doing so would be that we all lock ourselves up and never come out again.As well as an second flight between Belfast and Heathrow, Aer Lingus has advised all customers due to travel on the route to give themselves additional time to check in, as changes to the boarding procedure will be introduced and more luggage will be checked into the hold.It is expected that this additional frequency will result in reduced loads on each flight, the airline said.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By Ivan LittleMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe cast of the hit TV comedy Give My Head Peace yesterday raised a socially-distanced glass and gave a fond farewell round of applause to the actor BJ Hogg, who created one of the show#s most popular characters and who died last week.Observing coronavirus restrictions at his funeral, BJ#s friends and colleagues stayed well apart as they sipped their own small measures of Black Bush whiskey, the actor#s favourite tipple.The Hole in the Wall gang had been joined at a Lisburn funeral home by some other well-known actors and technicians who had worked with BJ throughout his illustrious career on stage and on screen.The star of The Fall TV series and the Oscar-nominated short movie Dance Lexie Dance died suddenly last week on his th birthday.His costume designer we Elish and their children Nathan and Abigail watched as his coffin was brought from the funeral parlour to a waiting hearse.Nathan had posted a video online of his father singing a powerful song from the Ulster Scots musical On Eagle#s Wing, and he added a message saying: Love you Dad. What a Voice.There were lighter moments on social media too. Some fans of BJ#s alter ego from Give My Head Peace , Big Mervyn, the dim-witted loyalist, wonderedhe would get a paramilitary-style funeral anda service would be conducted by the show#s fundamentalist Protestant cleric, Pastor Begbie.In the end there was no funeral service but Paddy Jenkins, the actor who plays Pastor Begbie, was among the mourners at the funeral home, along with other GMHP performers including Tim McGarry, Michael McDowell, Damon Quinn, Dan Gordon, Alexandra Ford and Marty Reid, who plays Big Mervyn#s sidekick, Uncle Andy.BBC floor manager Stephen Killen was also there, as were Game of Thrones star Ian McElhinney and his playwright we Marie Jones and actors Alan McKee and Marty Maguire.En route to Roselawn Crematorium, the hearse stopped briefly outside BJ#s old boyhood home in Westbourne Terrace, Lisburn.Some of the GMPH team went on to stand at the gates of Roselawn as BJ#s hearse arrived for cremation.No one is currently allowed inside the church there due to the Covid- crisis.Paddy Jenkins, who also worked with BJ on On Eagle#s Wing, reflected on a dficult day.He said: It was heartbreaking to realise that BJ#s loved ones didn#t get the chance to say a proper farewell. But the times we are living in mean nothing is the way it is supposed to be.There mightn#t have been a normal funeral for BJ today, but I know the family and all of us are determined that he will eventually get the sort of thanksgiving service that he so richly deserves once the current coronavirus emergency eases.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Executive is also assessing the wider health, societal and economic implications of the current restrictions to determine which areas will pose the least risk and greatest benefitwe were to relax them. “None of these decisions are easy, as we’ve said before all governments are grappling with the implications of a public health crisis that we never thought would come to pass. googletag.cmd.push “And COVID- has dramatically altered society and will have implications for the way we live for many years to come.” She added that there is a danger of the public becoming distracted and going back to what they did before. The First Minister said the country needs to be on guard and respect social distancing guidelines. She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added. She also took the opportunity to welcome Finance Minister Conor Murphys announcement of over pound million of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration, and tourism projects across the north. That includes match funding of poundm forDerry City and Strabanes City Deal Inclusive Future Fund.

With thousands of marathon and relay runners racing around the streets, many of them would have been raising much needed funds for a lot of charities.

Chair of Derry Trades Union Council Niall McCarroll has taken the opportunity to express his views on the coronavirus pandemic, current political system, the legacy of deprivation in Derry and to launch a workers’ charter. If the last few weeks have shown anything, it is that workers need unions. The low pay and bad conditions of many who are now praised as heroes cannot be tolerated any longer. We will have to be organised to push forward for real change. On May Day - International Workers’ Day - we raised the Red Flag of workers’ unity and socialism and launched our Workers’ Charter. We take this initiative in solidarity with the ordinary people of Ireland in a quest for a world where every child has a decent chance and workers are equal citizens, not powerless to shape their own destinies. googletag.cmd.push The charter calls for the Living Wage for all and a sht in the balance of wealth and power away from corporations and the rich and towards the rest of us. TheCovid- crisisis a threat to humanity. It has also laid bare the huge inequalities which have been covered up by a political system which gives an illusion of fair play and equal rights but deprives huge numbers of working people of rights and basic needs. Now, faced with the possibility of their whole system grinding to a halt, the establishment has found vast sums of money for emergency funding and relief schemes. The money was there all along - even when they were crying poverty and saying they couldn’t afford a boost to benefits or tiny wage rises. googletag.cmd.push Nurses, health service and frontlineworkersare going beyond all reasonable expectation to keep our families safe and the number of deaths down. Yet these are people whohave been undervalued for decades by consecutive governments and employers. Our health service, our care homes, our domiciliary care workers have been treated as it they were expendable, when they are actually crucial. The most precious of our public services have been vandalised by cuts while our unions, the only practical means of defending ourselves and fighting back, have been systematically weakened and marginalised. The community response to the crisis has been brilliant.Care, solidarity and cooperation have been the hallmarks of public response. This contrasts with the actions ofgovernments and corporationswhich have put protecting the “economy” and profits ahead of protecting people and public health. We want all workersto receive a tax-free payment of pound,, plus four additional bank holidays per year. That would be an acknowledgement of all that workers have been put through. Fine words from Government are no longer enough. Globally, one percent of the population holds almost half the world’swealth. We need a new system. But this will onlycome about through working class people across national boundaries beginning to shout out as one. The COVID- pandemic has begun an awakening. People are analysing and questioning the lives they live and the world they live in. Traders, hedge fund and private equity managers carry on regardless, hiding behind their buddies in government while being portrayed in much of the media as the only people who can pull us through the present predicament, get the economy moving again and so forth. If they are not on board, we are told, no recovery will be possible. Our political system has done nothing to challenge this devious assumption. There are few politicalparties which genuinely represent the interests of working-class people. Politics has taken power away from the people moved towards the major corporations. This is a reality all over the world, our world. This takeover of control by a ruling class comes with a decline in real wages and a raft of laws to hamstring union organisation. We need a determined fight back. Under the old way of doing things, PPE was not seen as really important. But the same establishment had no problem when it came to stockpiling private wealth or extracting profit from wealth created by the labour of working people. The NHS, social housing, education, mental health services, community-based social care have been deprived of funds and support while obscene amounts of money are spent on missiles, bombs, drones and all the high-tech machinery of war, which benefits no one apart from arms manufacturers and war-mongers. The UK has the sixth biggest defence budget in the world. It is set to reach pound billion this year. A fraction of this, pound. billion, could more than cover the cost of a year’s furloughing of workers.  The total spend on UK military bases is pound million a year - enough to double the supply of medical ventilator machines. Military budgets and the arms trade are causing untold misery. A government of the people would invest this money in areas such as green energy, creating jobs which would encourage global solidarity and protection of the planet. In Derry and the North West, the crisis has unied people - but has also put a spotlight on the local legacy of deprivation, poverty wages and a run-down of public services. We also have the unreasonable situation of two erging public health responses toCovid- on a small island, increasing the threat to lives. Our lives cross the border every day. But we have erging health services, erging employment laws and erging welfare systems. We cannot allow working people and communities to bear the burden of Covid-on top of a public health and economic crisis. We need a new direction for society, towards equality and justice.

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at. Now, you can reframe it as an opportunity to work on something to get better at and when we do get backyou are a better player.” Inidual work would be aerobic fitness, increasing strength and acceleration, as well as working on technical skills. Its about getting your weak side up to a level you can use under pressure and speeding up the execution of skills. It could be something as simple as rehabbing an injury. What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement. It is something you can control and work on and measure. “There are so many things about this situation at the minute, and this is le in general, that we dont have control over. We dont know when it will end. “We have control over the small things, like washing our hands, but we have no control over when sport happens again and le gets back to normal. “It is about the things you can control right now...working on things like your touch, on your acceleration – you have complete control over these things.” “It is hugely important as we manage our emotions, as we go through this. If you are focussing on things you cant control...you are going to feel anxious, down and all those negative things.” CONNECTIONS Aside from the competitive streak, the sporting environment is one of inclusion. Dressing room banter and the slagging around training breeds a team spirit. After a stressful day at work, exercise and collective training is a welcome release. Without the regular bond, it presents a mental strain. “For our own mental health, it is so important to stay connected to people we normally connect with,” Brick stresses. It is important for team environments to still foster that togetherness, evenit is an articial way, via video conferencing. “You are apart from each other, you are doing a bit of training together but separately. That connection is massively important. “We all take part in sport because we love taking part, but we also enjoy the company of the people we take part with. Keeping that companionship and connectivity is so important. “We are physically distancing and socially isolating, but through that, it is important that we dont completely socially disconnect from other people. It only has benefits and one is for our own mental health.” To conclude, Brick highlighted an non-sport theme he has noticed with many of his students and clients. “People are taking the time to slow down to a certain extent, to reconnect with what is important in le and spend time with family. “That is a positive. We get wrapped up in our work bubble or our sport bubble, we forget about the important things.” RELATED - Derry GAA doctor on the importance of exercise. Click here...

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

Her death on Saturday morning at Altnagelvin Hospital has left a profound sense of sadness among her friends and neighbours in the street, which she called her home for so many years. As her remains were brought to Long Tower church on Sunday evening, neighbours stopped to remember a special lady, known for her warm generosity and heart of gold. It was a journey that Bridget Carroll had made thousands of times before, to a church that became her second home. googletag.cmd.push Affectionately known as ‘Wee Bridget’ to all her family and friends, Bridget was a daily Communicant until chronic illness took hold several years ago. At every Benediction service, Holy Hour, Parish Retreat, and Stations of the Cross, Bridget could be found in her familiar seat at the back of the church. Indeed she was a particular devotee of the yearly parish retreat and loved getting the traditional new outfit for the last day. Born in Kilkenny on July , , Bridget came to live at Nazareth House in Fahan as an infant, and received her education at Nazareth House in Bishop Street. googletag.cmd.push Her first job was working in the Nazareth House care home where she loved caring for the elderly residents and listening to their stories. Bridget moved to Dublin to work in the Mater Hospital with her best friend Kathleen, and stayed in the Fair City for  years. However Bridget missed the sense of home she felt in her adopted Derry, and ed to the city where she settled into le working at a number of cafes in the town, becoming a familiar face to many. For many years she lived in the iconic Rossville Flats in the Bogside, and she was delighted when she was relocated to her new home in Bishop Street when the flats were marked for demolition. Bridget’s many friendships formed the centre of her le, always staying in touch with her childhood friend Kathleen Smith who is now living in Dublin, Rita McDaid, Monica Gransha, and Kathleen Doherty from Sunbeam Terrace. You knew she had come for a visit when you heard the doorbell ring, the door open, and her familiar voice shout out – ‘It’s only me!’ The  year old loved to have a chat and always kept up with the local news buying every local newspaper each week. Bridget was a member of many groups often giving her time as a volunteer in Termonbacca, with Cursillo, St Joseph’s Young Priests Society, as a regular chapel cleaner and a parish reader. Bridget also loved travelling and was the first to sign up for any bus runs in the parish. Her favourite run without question was to the pilgrimage site of Knock, but her trips also took her as far as Lourdes on six occasions, Fatima, Buncrana, and Lough Derg. She spoke often of her devotion to the Blessed Mother and Padre Pio, it was this faith that helped her in recent years as she battled her deteriorating health. Several years ago she moved from her flat at the bottom of Bishop Street, to Alexander House at the top of Bishop Street. Here, Bridget found a new sense to the meaning of home. She formed new friendships with the staff and fellow residents, and received dedicated and loving care around the clock. Bridget Carroll will be remembered for her straight talking, unforgettable laugh, loyal friendship and beautul spirit. She often said that even though she was not born here, she felt that she was a Derry woman at heart. Many will miss chatting to her and giving her a wave as she made her way to and from the city centre for her shopping. Bishop Street will never be the same again without her.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

Mr Eastwood said that John will be remembered for his defence of the public purse and his famous good humour. “John Dallat lived and breathed to serve others, said Mr Eastwood. “For over  years he was the most loyal servant to the people of East Derry and a fierce friend to everyone in the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push I know I speak for everyone in the party when I say his good humour and wise advice will be sorely missed. “John entered public le at a time and in a place when it was dficult to be an SDLP representative. I know that, despite his tough exterior, he was often hurt when the hand of friendship he extended across the sectarian ide in the late s and early s in Coleraine Council wasnt always accepted. But it never stopped him trying and only strengthened his lelong resolve to oppose violence and its supporters. “As a public representative, John struck fear into the heart of anyone who dared misspend a penny of public money. His forensic skill as a member of the Public Accounts Committee may not have won him many friends in the higher levels of the public sector but it won him respect across political lines. It was a respect he maintained with a fair hand as Deputy Speaker of the Assembly. googletag.cmd.push “Even retirement couldn’t stop him and I’m glad that he came back to the SDLP Assembly team in . We will miss his infectious laugh and his deep experience. “My thoughts, and the thoughts of everyone in the SDLP, are with his we Anne, his children Helena, Ronan, Diarmuid and his eight grandchildren. John’s family meant everything to him. We’re thinking of them at this dficult time and I hope they are comforted by the knowledge that he made an immeasurable dference.

Mary Rogers was born in  at the tail end of the Spanish Flu’s effects and reaches her latest milestone as the word is reeling from another pandemic. Unable to enter the home due to Covid- restrictions, Mary’s family joined in the celebrations through the window of the care home where she has spent the last two years. Staff were able to ensure social distancing regulations were adhered to as popular singer Wayne Rodgers serenaded Mary, her family and the other guests.  The former Burns factory worker has been looking forward to her birthday for months and was delighted to receive telegrams from the Queen, President Higgins and her grand-nephew in Australia. googletag.cmd.push Mary began working in Burns shirt factory in Draperstown in the early s and travelled the three miles back and forth by bicycle, beginning a lelong interest in sewing and needlework. The camaraderie in the factory resulted in many friendships and she recalls them fondly while telling stories of her childhood and working le. Mary nursed her father and step-mother during their final illnesses and with less support available back then, had to give up working in the factory to become a full-time carer. Once joking she was the only person to have been carried out of a graveyard after breaking her ankle visiting a grave, she has attributed her long le to having never married. googletag.cmd.push  She has a great rapport with her grand nieces and nephews and is constantly involved in their lives and hobbies, sometimes learning the rules of unfamiliar games in order to stay engaged. Mary’s niece, Sue Boyle, thanked the staff at the care home for their support. She said: “Having cared for so many throughout her le, she is now lucky enough to receive the excellent care of the staff in Magherafelt Manor. “We want to put on record their appreciation for all their thoughtfulness and support. “We also want to thank all her friends and neighbours for their help and support to Mary while she was at home and for their best wishes on this great occasion. “Mary’s positive attitude, determination and strong faith have given her the blessing of a long, full and happy le and we hope will see her celebrate many more birthdays.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America. The important markers in the career of one of Derry’s famous sons. RELATED - Gerry McElhinney - the greatest showman. Click here...

The response to the classes has been brilliant and I have kept it on, even though I am teaching PE full-time in Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.ldquoObviously with COVID- I am off work now and with no GAA or fitness classes I have more time on my hands.ldquoI put out the idea on social media on Friday morning and then spent the weekend putting together the first class to upload Monday morning.ldquoI honestly didnrsquot know what to expect really. I was thinking maybeI managed to pull in a hundred people at pound each, pound would be a reasonable target.But I have really been overwhelmed by the response.Members of her usual weekly classes in Pilates for Paula responded immediately, but her school quickly weighed in behind the effort and her many acquaintances in GAA and camogie.Despite her organisation of the fundraiser, in her words being ldquoa bit last minute, her target was realised eight-fold and she presented a cheque for pound, last week.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe it really. When I saw Instagram stories of Sophie Colgan in New York taking part, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside [the Slaughtneil camog], who has been in New Zealand for the past year, signing up, and Sarah Donnelly, the Tyrone footballer in Australia, it just shows you that the people you meet through the GAA will always support each other.Paula last year captained Clonduff to the All-Ireland club title and she has played for Down and Ulster over many years, while her husband Darren is the Down football captain.ldquoThe GAA camogie community is absolutely fabulous. They rallied around my family after Christmas and provided a lot of comfort and again the response has been phenomenal.ldquoCOVID- has challenged the family once more. Clodaghrsquos parents, my brother Darren and his we Carol, live in Coleraine and it has been very dficult for us as a family to support them. What has happened over Easter week has given us all a huge lt and we are very thankful for all that support from our GAA family.ldquoI have got a lot of messages since the last class on Friday and everyone seems to have enjoyed them. A lot had never done exercise like that and now want me to provide more classes online and keep it going for as long as we are all prevented from going back to work.ldquoI think plenty of people are finding the lockdown very tough mentally and I got that back in the messages too, about how they felt a lot more positive after doing the exercise, a lot fresher and ready to face the day.She added: ldquoThe people who supported the fundraiser have helped themselves, helped Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI Research and really supported the Gribben family.You can still contribute to Leukaemia Lymphonania Research by searching for Carol and Darren Gribbenrsquos fundraiser in aid of Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI on Facebook or follow this link https:www.facebook donate  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Delamont.jpg","title":"Delamont remains closed in lockdown  ","story":"DELAMONT Country Park outside Killyleagh is to remain closed to visitors.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has confirmed that the gates to the stunning park on the shores of Strangford Lough will not reopen, despite last weekrsquos decision by Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots to reopen Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks.The decision not to allow visitors into Delamont was taken by the leaders of the local councilrsquos main parties during a meeting held via Skype last week and has been welcomed by local councillors Billy Walker and Dermot Curran.Cllr Walker said all the party leaders agreed that is it too soon to reopen Delamont, confirming that the closure decision will be reviewed next month.ldquoThere are real concerns that allowing the public to access the country park could lead to a major surge in visitors which is not what anyone wants at this particular time. The last thing we need is for family picnics and hundreds of other visitors arriving at a time when coronavirus remains a very real and present danger, continued the Rowallane councillor.Cllr Walker described the decision to reopen forest parks as ldquopremature and said Newry, Mourne and Down Council deserved praise for keeping all its country parks closed for the time being.He added: ldquoThe closure decision is being kept under review and I believe that there is still some way to go before council-owned parks will be open to the public.ldquoThere will be people upset that Delamont remains closed, but we all have to adhere to the public advice we have been given in relation to social distancing and, where possible, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Cllr Curran said he supports the decision to keep Delamont closed and praised what he described as the local authorityrsquos ldquocourageous decision.He argued that the big danger with warmer weather and clearer evenings now here is that reopening the country park could lead to a major influx of visitors and that enforcing social distancing measures would be particularly dficult,not impossible.ldquoThere was perhaps a temptation to reopen Delamont given the decision to allow people to access Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, but the local council has stood firm, putting the safety of people front and centre and is to be applauded for doing so, said Cllr Curran.ldquoErring on the side of caution is the right thing to do at this time. It would be an awful situation to reopen the park and for someone to contract coronavirus as a result. The park will reopen at some stage, but not just now. Peoplersquos health and safety must come first.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said despite the decision by Mr Poots to reopen parks managed by the Forest Service all those that the local authority is responsible for, including Delamont, will remain closed.Council officials say that the decision to close Delamont taken on March  remains in place for the time being, but will be reviewed as public health advice guidance develops.ldquoMembers decided that it was too soon to consider reopening parks at this time, said a council spokesman.In addition, he said it was felt that reopening local authority-owned country park would encourageresidents from outside the district to make a non-essential journey to these facilities for exercise, thus increasing the volume of traffic and congestion at these locations and increasing the risk of further spread of COVID- across the district.ldquoThe focus of the council at this time must be the safety of our citizens and implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, said the spokesman.ldquoThe council continues to advise our citizens that the single most important action they can take is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Doreen.jpg","title":"Doreen to step down after 20 years as leader at Leitrim playgroup  ","story":"A LEITRIM woman, who has been the driving force behind a local playgroup for almost  years, is stepping down.Doreen Shahmohammadi is a familiar face around the village, especially to young people as the leader of Leitrim Community Playgroup.Doreen, her Iranian husband, Reza, and twin sons, Michael and Colm, settled in Leitrim a few years before she began the playgroup in January . She soon experienced a strong sense of community and friendship that has kept them there ever since.She started the playgroup with the support of the local GAA club, Liatroim Fontenoys, which offered her use of their premises to begin with.ldquoIn the first year we went from having five children to  children, she said. ldquoWe had no funding in the first year, but the Fontenoys were very good to us by covering the cost of heating and telephone charges.ldquoBy the second year funding was made available by the Southern Education and Library Board for  pre-school places and it wasnrsquot long before we secured funding to build a purpose-built playgroup which sits within the boundary of the Fontenoys club.ldquoWithin a few years and thanks to additional funding enrolment rose to  places. Depending on the birth rate it has usually remains around the same number each year.Doreen loves to have children around her. In fact, Reza reminds her all the time that she is a magnet in attracting them wherever she goes.Doreen is a very proud mother. Her sons, now , graduated as doctors five years ago and both are working on the frontline during the COVID- pandemic. Colm is working in intensive care, while Michael works between cardiology and intensive care.ldquoOver the years, I have loved, cared for and educated every child that has come to the playgroup as though they were my own children, he says.ldquoI am going to miss them all very much, more than you can ever imagine. I hope Irsquom not to be a stranger to the playgroup after my retirement.Doreen says the current playgroup team, made up of deputy leader Michelle McCabe and temporary assistant, Danielle Clarke, have worked well together over the past few years. Other long term members of staff were Janet King, Tina Owens and Diane Baxter.ldquoThe playgroup has been my le and I have enjoyed welcoming hundreds of children to their pre-school year experience. It is a lovely learning environment to be part of, she continued.ldquoWe are blessed with the children and their families in the community who have entered our setting and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and committees past and present, children, grandparents, childminders and, of course, the wider community who have supported me and who have been so generous over the years.ldquoMost of all, I would like to thank the trustees who have supported me for all these years and provided me with the opportunity to establish an excellent learning environment for pre-school children, not forgetting my sincere thanks to the Fontenoys for all their support and encouragement.She added: ldquoI wish my successor every success and I hope they will enjoy and appreciate every single minute they spend with the children as I have done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Life.jpg","title":"Ex Drumaness man praises Kiwis as country comes out of lockdown  ","story":"A FORMER Drumaness man who has been living in New Zealand for the past  years has this week revealed what le in lockdown has been like Down Under.Barry Brennanrsquos adopted homeland has been praised for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the country this week emerging from a strict five-week quarantine which included the strictest constraints paced on New Zealanders in modern history.The countryrsquos prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, hailed New Zealanders for their incredible work to ldquobreak the virusrsquos chain of transmission which has allowed the country to downgrade its highest alert level from four to three, with amendedrestrictions expected to be in place for around two more weeks.The move means that many shops have reopened while public gatherings of  people are now permissible for weddings and funerals, with schools also set to reopen. In addition, Kiwis can now fish, hunt, surf, swim and play golf.New Zealand has suffered only , confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths after moving quickly to impose a lockdown last month, with the easing of quarantine measures paving the way for around , people toto work under a more relaxed regime.Barry mdash who specialises in home renovations and employs several people mdash has not ed to work yet, but is more than happy in the idyllic rural setting of Mangawhai in the North Island just five minutes from the beach, where he lives with his we, Sian, and children Sean, Danny and Liam.The New Zealand government is still asking citizens to stay at home and to practise social distancing, with Barry hoping that it wonrsquot be long before the country again enjoys some sense of normality.And he has the praised prime minister for her approach to COVID-, with Arden arguing that a drastic short-term action would benefit the countryrsquos economy in the long run.On Monday, it was confirmed that there is no widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand, with Ms Arden warning that the country was not yet out of the woods.ldquoWhen you look at what happened where in the world in relation to coronavirus, the prime minister did a good job, said Barry, who headed to New Zealand with his friend Barry Armstrong in .ldquoI was a qualied carpenter and Barry, who lived just up the road from me, was a bricklayer who had a contact in New Zealand so we headed off on a -month visa to Auckland. Barry stayed for  months before heading home but I am still here, married with three boys.ldquoThe coronavirus has had a worldwide impact and while many people were wondering what would happen in New Zealand, I always had a feeling that the prime minister would go at the pandemic hard and fast and that is exactly what she did.Barry revealed that New Zealanders were told to prepare for lockdown on March  and that two days later a series of strict measures were introduced.ldquoClearly the prime minister had a look at what was happening in other parts of the world before the virus got a hold here and she moved to minimise its impact. I think that she has done an amazing job to be quite honest.ldquoFour and a half weeks after the lockdown measures were implemented, there was only one confirmed coronavirus case in New Zealand at the start of this week. Indeed, the government knows exactly where every case is in the country.Barry said anyone arriving in the country and is suspected of having the virus is quarantined and believes thatthere was ever to be another pandemic in the future, countries would do well to take a close look at what New Zealand did to halt its deadly spread.ldquoEverything really happened so fast here and we did not have that much time to think about what was going in, he continued.ldquoI played golf with the principal of the school my youngest boy attends and he said he did not think NewZealand would go into lockdown. Forty eight hours later we were told it was happening.Barry said the country rightly decided that it wasnrsquot taking any chances and locked everything down, apart from supermarkets, with strict social distancing rules in place.ldquoWe have gone from a level four alert to level three but I am still not back at work as there a lot of iables that I need to consider, explained the former Drumaness man. ldquoIn my line of work I would be close to homeowners so I will just wait until the restrictions ease a bit more.Barry relocated from Auckland to Mangawhai six years ago and home is now a three and a half acre plot where he built a shooting gallery and what he describes as a ldquobit of a golf course. He also looks after a few animals.With no immediateto work on the horizon, Barry is keeping busy mowing lawns and feeding his animals, with a little help from his sons.With his parents, Sean and Mary, still living at the family home at the Cumber Road in Drumaness, Barry says he is in regular contact with them. He said his dad is good with Whatsapp and regularly tells him that New Zealand lamb is cheaper in Ireland than down under.ldquoWe have lots of contact with my parents and are in touch once or twice a week. I also have an older brother, Seamus who lives in Auckland. We both played for Loughinisland GAC. I also keep up-to-date with what is going there via social media and stuff, he continued.ldquoMy brother, Mark, is a former Loughinisland club chairman who was involved in the plans for building the new clubhouse. I also keep tabs on Down GAArsquos fortunes.As Barry waits for the right time toto work, he said that during the lockdown, New Zealanders mostly did what they were told.He added: ldquoThey were sensible and the approach has worked as things are slowly ing to normal, but we know that we have a little way to go yet..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 29%2C 1980  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash A new library for Newcastle is to be given priority soon by the South Eastern Education Board, it was claimed this week.The claim came from Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, who said she believed that Board members realised they had made a bad mistake and are now prepared to reverse their attitude.Mrs Smyth, addressing a meeting of Down councillors on Monday, explained that she had recently asked the Board for an undertaking that the Newcastle Library project would be given a priority rating for new capital schemes.ldquoI think the whole Board realised they made a bad mistake and they are quite willing to go ahead and get something done quickly, said Mrs Smyth.Mrs Smyth made her surprise announcement after Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue attacked the Boardrsquos attitude over a new library for the seaside town.Mr OrsquoDonoghue claimed that an original Board decision to put Newcastle on a low priority rating was taken without consulting the Boardrsquos chief librarian who was in favour of early attention for Newcastle.He called the lack of consultation and criticised the Board for not responding fully to points raised by a council deputation several months ago.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce is beginning to draw up plans for another trade week ndash and such was the success of the last venture that itrsquos been decided to extend this yearrsquos event to ten days.The dates being set aside for the trade week are Thursday, June th to Saturday, June st, and it is hoped that the townrsquos traders will offer many bargains to help attract business.Last yearrsquos trade week was a major success and most businesses in the town have reaped the benefit since. New customers were attracted to the town and quality goods and competitive prices have encouraged many toon a regular basis.The growing stature of the town as a shopping centre has been helped by the introduction of new shops, particularly in the Dromore Street area, and by the good car parking facilities on offer.Market Day every Thursday brings hundreds of people from the surrounding district flooding into the town ndash and with two Market Days cropping up in the new extended trade week this year, the Chamber is hopeful that shopping will hit a new peak in June.QUOILE ndash A concerted effort is being made by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Down District Council to make the -mile stretch of the Quoile River into a fishing paradise.Regarded as one of the best fishing waters in the province, the Quoile is hardly known nationally, and itrsquos the aim of the Tourist Board and the council to make it as popular as the Fermanagh Lakelands, the current number one fishing haven.The joint effort to put the Quoile on the fishing map is being spearheaded by Ian Heaps, the former inidual world champion angler and current member of the English international team, who has been carrying out a survey over the past ten days.And his report could influence the Tourist Board to pump more money into publicising the Quoile to world-wide anglers.Already Heaps has spent ten days fishing the Quoile and its ancillary waters ndash and his expert opinion is that itrsquos one of the best that Northern Ireland has to offer.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Vikings ed to invade Killyleagh this week ndash but this time it was a more peaceful visit.The invaders, instead of arriving by longship to pillage and plunder, came to look over youth provision in the area and they left totally impressed by the friendly reception they received.The unlikely invaders were a group of youth workers from Norway and Spain, who visited the area as part of a five-day study of youth work and facilities in the province.Local stops were at the Seaboard Sailing Centre in Killyleagh, Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Castlewellan and Downpatrick Folk Club.Tuesday afternoon and night was spent in the area, with the first stop for the Norwegians being at the Seaboard centre.STRANGFORD ndash The recently formed Strangford Village Improvement Committee is to seek public support to have an order enforcing the one-way system in the village revoked.The committee discussed the system at their monthly meeting on Thursday and, after hearing of the failure of a meeting between the Department of Environment officials, traffic police and RUC representatives to have something done about it, they decided that the support of the public is needed.The committee chairman told members that the top level meeting had fallen on deaf ears and that nothing could be done about the situation.They had discussed the possibility of altering the system, the ious proposals which the committee had made as alternatives to it, and the fact that the majority of residents did not want the system.Unfortunately the Department rejected all the committeersquos proposals and insisted that the system, in its present form, would have to remain, said the chairman.The chairman had askedthe one-way system would not be made permanent until all attempts to accommodate the residentrsquos wishes had been made but the Department replied that the systemis already permanentand had been made so by Government order. Nothing could be done about it unless the order was revoked.KILLINCHY ndash The st Killinchy Company of the Boys Brigade held its th annual display in the Church Hall on Friday evening.Chairman for the evening was the Rev R A McKee, the inspecting officer was Mr C T Johnston, of st Cargycreevy, and the presentation of prizes was made by Mrs M Moles.The company gave the usual high standard display, with a ied programme of drill, games and sketches, before captain, Raymond Finlay, gave his annual report.Three boys received their Queens Badges, the highest award in the BB, namely Alistair Davidson, Robin Thompson and Samuel Dines.Three had also received their presidentrsquos badges, namely Bill Dunlop, Wesley Blythe and Andrew Bishop, and four had received their Duke of Edinburgh bronze awards, namely David Morrow, Mark Davidson, Robin Thompson and Robert McBurney.DOWNPATRICK ndash A breathtaking two-hour pageant is being drawn up as the centrepiece of this yearrsquos St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick.An outdoor site has already been chosen and plans are well advanced to produce a startling display of battle scenes, comedy scenes, music and games.And to show they mean business the organisers have appointed one of the countryrsquos leading stage producers, Mr Michael Poynor, to act as a full-time director.The site, which is near the Quoile, will resemble a giant film set with authentic costumes and props depicting the time of the earliest settlers in Lecale to the arrival of the Normans.CASTLEWELLAN ndash Kilmegan Youth Club, Castlewellan, triumphed in the final of the South Eastern Education and Library Board Youth Club quiz held in Downpatrick on Monday night.

The online sales are set to continue as marts across the province begin to reopen.Cllr Lewis said the marts have a crucial role to play, allowing farmers to buy and sell livestock, at what is a traditionally a busy time of the year for them. Crucially, he said reopening marts will help with their respective incomes.He said there was ldquosignicant concern when the marts closed last month, with farmers expressing concern that they could find themselves overstocked with animals, particularly store cattle and ped calves.ldquoNews of the gradual reopening of local marts is an important development and will be widely welcomed across the agricultural sector at this time, said Cllr Lewis.The Slieve Croob councillor said DAERA was to be applauded for its decision, particularly given the key role farmers play in supplying the local food chain.ldquoIt is essential that in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public, he continued.ldquoAt this time of year, many farmers are seeking to purchase stock for the grazing season and obviously others are selling their stock through the marts. Dairy farms will also find themselves overstocked with dropped calves that they would normally be selling.Cllr Lewis said there were farmers wishing to sell and buy livestock and it was ldquovital in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public.A DAERA spokesman said farmers were key workers and were continuing to provide food for everyone in ldquovery challenging circumstances with part of the food supply chain the ability to trade and sell animals.ldquoStaff within the department have maintained regular contact with livestock mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements, he continued.ldquoFarmers, like all businesses, are facing financial dficulties as a result of COVID-. Being able to trade again at the marts will provide much needed cash flow..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Into.jpg","title":"Into the Blues   Jake signs pro contract with Linfield  ","story":"A TEENAGE local footballer says hersquos ldquoover the moon after signing professional terms with Linfield.Eighteen year-old Jake Corbett, from Dromara, has signed his first professional contract with the Blues after some stellar performances for Linfield Swts.The exciting young player has scored around  goals this season, despite playing in midfield.And he also helped the Swts lt the Steel  Sons Cup as they beat Newington - in the Christmas Day showdown.Jake, who joined the Windsor Park outfit three years ago, has been football mad since the age of ten.He played youth football for Dromore Amateurs, then broke his way into the clubrsquos first team and played in the Amateur League.After spells with Banbridge Town, Lisburn Distillery and Crusaders he joined Linfield at the age of .An attacking central midfielder, he made an immediate impact and firmly established himself in the Swts set-up.His prowess has also earned international honours.

In many ways, itrsquos strange to think that by staying home I can save a le.My sister, Martina, loved le, but she was only  when she passed away in . Seasonal flu was the culprit which overwhelmed her body. COVID- is a frightening virus for the world to contend with. But it is especially frightening for people like me.Martina and I were born with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle wasting condition which robs people of the ability to walk, eat and breathe.I now live an active, productive le, thanks to many interventions that started in my childhood. I had a tube ed into my stomach to ensure that I could get the nutrients I could no longer eat as half of the muscles I use to swallow became paralysed. I also began using a non-invasive ventilator.COVID- has been on our radar since the beginning of January. I could do little but watch and wait. The plans would not be much dferent than my usual flu-time plans which ensure that I am in protective bubble, which allows my family to do everything it can to maintain an infection-free environment around me.Sure enough, almost  days ago, it was time to take action, with the Hollywood lockdown coming almost two weeks before it was implemented for everyone . And within a few days of the official lockdown beginning, I was also furloughed from work at a leading charity for people with conditions like mine.This has been one of the most emotionally and mentally dficult parts of the pandemic for me personally. Since I was  I have been working with and for this charity to improve lives. But within a few short days my le had drastically changed.Last September, I took eight flights in three weeks as I was selected for an Emerging Leaders programme by the US State Department for my work with disabled people and for a national conference for people with conditions like mine in London.Now, I have to stay within the bounds of my driveway. I can only go outside because my neighbours are all so far away. A small mercy.It quickly became obvious that getting food and other essential supplies was not going to be easy. Large supermarkets only started offering registration to extremely vulnerable customers a few weeks in to the lockdown.Before lockdown began few,any supermarkets offered a dedicated shopping time to extremely vulnerable customers, making getting food dficult during a time when it was flying off the shelves in panic buying.Crossgarrsquos SuperValu store got us through those first few weeks as it was able to deliver some essentials, while Gordons Pharmacy in Downpatrick has been delivering to us for some time now. But the pharmacyrsquos willingness to collect our preions has been a huge weight off our shoulders.I have now been able to register the family with Sainsburyrsquos for deliveries of other items we need to keep us ticking over, while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos food delivery package service has been much more successful than those in other parts of the UK.The one that we have received included food that I could eat ndash something many of my friends in the rest of the UK are not so lucky with. The parcel is one small, yet very important part of the support our government is offering that it has got right, even though it has only been in place for us for three weeks.It took us several weeks to set up everything we needed, but I know that many others are still trying and are having to take drastic, le-endangering measures to keep it going.However, COVID- is not just a negative in the lives of disabled people.Virtual concerts, musicals on YouTube for all and even online quiz nights have become the new normal of socialising.Many jobs and educational institutions have moved staff to work from home and online, something that some disabled people were often refused when they asked for it. Even the community spirit and volunteering has left us feeling overwhelmed with offers of help.It is my hope that we can use this opportunity to see what our future can be.A more accepting and inclusive society, where disabled people can fully take part.

Unfortunately after all of the hard work of labour, I had to have a C-section and James Patrick was born at .pm on Tuesday. Ryan was allowed into the recovery room with me for two hours, but after that he didnrsquot see me or the baby until Thursday afternoon when we were allowed home.Prospective parents have been told that only one birth partner is currently allowed into the delivery ward, but onlythey are well and show no signs of coronavirus.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoApart from the labour and the C-section, it was a positive experience. I think I was more anxious in the days coming up to the birth as I didnrsquot know what the restrictions would mean. In hindsight, it wasnrsquot that bad and it was probably worse for Ryan sitting at home. He rang his sister who has four children and asked when she thought he could do and she said clean the house.Baby James Patrick was only one day overdue, but Mrs Lawlor was delighted that he decided to make an appearance when he did. A clue to his birth weight may be due to his mother being ft  inches tall, while dad Ryanis ft  inches.While Mrs Lawlor did not have to wear a face mask during her labour, but the midwives who attended her afterwards were masked.She said: ldquoI suppose as this was an all-new experience for both Ryan and I we have nothing to compare it to.ldquoI remember waking up the next day, not that I slept that much in the night, and thought, lsquoOh no, I have a whole day by myself in here with this brand new babyrsquo. But the nurses and midwives are coming that often to do a iety of checks that the days went quite fast.ldquoHowever, I remember that I felt the second night in hospital was awfully long and I really struggled with dealing with James. Normally,you have a bit of help during the day and night, you can manage better to get a bit of sleep.ldquoThe strangest thing was seeing quite a few of the staff with masks and visors on. While they were all lovely, you lost a bit of the personal touch and connection with them because of the masks. Sometimesthey were maintaining social distancing and werenrsquot close to you, you couldnrsquot actually see who it was. The staff were all wonderful but you didnrsquot know what they looked like.As a sportswoman, who used to play for Loughinisland GACrsquos senior ladies and at county level, Mrs Lawlor is recovering well after the birth. Her husband is also well-known in local sporting circles as hersquos on the executive committee of Loughinisland GAC.They are becoming accustomed to the lsquonewrsquo normal at home of being first-time parents amid the lockdown.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoWe have had visitors to the house looking through the window at the baby. Itrsquos still hard for everyone as my sister is itching to get a wee cuddle and all our family members want to hold him. That canrsquot happen for very good reasons and I donrsquot know when that will change. Thatrsquos one of the strange things about having a baby in the lockdown.ldquoHowever, the simplicity of le today is quite nice. I think itrsquos possibly the best time to have a baby. We have plenty to keep ourselves busy with James Patrick in the lockdown and therersquos nothing  to distract us.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry athlete takes lockdown in her stride  ","story":"CIARA Mageeanrsquos Olympic ambitions may have been put on hold owing to coronavirus, but shersquos taking the lockdown in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig.

I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Railway.jpg","title":"Railway vandals condemned  ","story":"VANDALS have struck at the heritage steam railway in Downpatrick.The window of a railway carriage was smashed with a concrete block some time over the weekend.The damage was discovered by a volunteer at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway premises on Monday morning.Part of a concrete block was found inside the carriage along with evidence that the vandals had been smoking.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is comforting to imagine that police excesses during coronavirus have been teething troubles yet it is hard to make excuses for the statements of senior police officers : FreelanceFirst Coronavirus, and then economic woes — now a cull of civil liberties.Instinctively, we sympathise with hardworking police officers at this most dficult time. It is comforting to imagine that police excesses were mere teething troubles The police’s made-up coronavirus law ought to unsettle anyone who understands democracy,’ Sam McBride, April . It was doubtless a new recruit, bored of making tea, who fabricated Facebook edicts for the good folks of Larne. Perhaps Causeway Coast officers were distracted by the fine scenery while ticketing people for buying food. Yet it is dficult to make excuses for the premeditated statements of senior police officers. Issuing clarication, Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said:“Is your journey necessary and is it reasonable  These are the questions you need to ask yourself before you travel because the test of reasonableness and necessity are the parameters within which police officers must operate.”.This is an astonishing statement. While requiring a ‘reasonable excuse’, the legislation nowhere mentions ‘necessity’ as a condition of leaving the house. Never. Not once. The commentary of a Trappist monk on the  Olympics could not be more profoundly silent.When pressed to justy this, the PSNI noted that the legislation referred to activities such as exercise or giving blood as ‘a need’.Our police leadership did not seem to notice that the legislation ‘includes’ such needs as reasonable excuses, so allowing the possibility of others. Equally oblivious that a general ‘need’ is not a particular ‘necessity’, they remained unperturbed that no other UK police force extracted this meaning - despite operating under the same wording.So we were left with the peculiar situation where the Assembly had determined that exercise or obtaining food was a ‘need’, but the PSNI was taking upon itself to question whether any particular form of exercise or food purchase was a ‘necessity’. Aside from democratic implications, this ‘necessity’ test is unattainably high.I have a need of nutrition, but it is hardly a ‘necessity’ that I munch on this particular Granny Smith at this set time. The Assembly says I can take reasonable exercise. “Ah”, counters our officer, ‘but is it necessary to walk down this deserted lane  Whatyou are tempted to take a photograph or allow your child to pick some flowers  You could run on the spot in your kitchen, preferably while self-flagellating for doubting our advice”.On the th April the PSNI, together with the Department of Health, issued a further statement.Happily, all tests of necessity have gone the way of the dodo, and wemay hope they rest in peace.Radically, the police now intend to follow the law, applying a test of‘reasonable excuse’. While a further explanation that reasonable excuse refers not to the intentions of the inidual but government policy is unusual, let us be charitable. Well done.Yet the final sentence of the statement is sobering:“We are deeply concerned that the current discourse may serve to undermine public confidence in the overall regulations, and encourage some people to ignore the strong guidance from the NI Executive with potentially devastating consequences.”.It is unclear that the police should act as cheerleader for the wisdom of any government legislation. Yet regardless of how many laws are made up, or how inaccurate statements seem, senior police are “deeply concerned” at public comment on the issue. Nothing to do with me, Gov’!This apparent indference to free speech in the very body supposed to guard our liberty: that is what deeply concerns me.• Andrew Clarke is a councillor for Coast Road, Mid and East Antrim"},{"url":null,"title":"religious background question next years census part crude headcount says alliance ","story":"Breakdown of NI coronavirus cases by council areaFamily and friends say farewell to actor BJ HoggNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusFarmingNewsPoliticsReligious background question in next year’s census part of a crude headcount, says AllianceNext year’s census unnecessarily entails a “ridiculous” headcount of Protestants and Catholics, Alliance has said as it objected to proposals set out yesterday.By Sam McBrideTuesday, th May , : pm\"\"The census will be held on March  next yearThe once in a decade government survey will be conducted on March  – the same date as the census in the rest of the UK and yesterday legislation was brought to the Assembly to approve the process.Some experts have predicted that next year’s census will for the first time indicate a Catholic majority in Northern Ireland.For those who say they are not religious, the census will nevertheless ask them to state the religion in which they were brought up. Objecting to that question, Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said that was “outdated and insulting to many people who do not wish to be identied by their religious background”.She said the census “will deliver information that perpetuates a Catholic or Protestant headcount data that is not relevant and that is quite disrespectful to the growing number of people who no longer wish to be defined by a specic religion or who do not have a religion”. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

If, because of coronavirus or, indeed, any other reason, a census cannot be taken, further legislation will be brought before the Assembly to amend the plans laid out here”.The census will also involve new questions on sexual orientation,autism and Asperger’s syndrome, and renewable energy.TUV leader Jim Allister challenged Sinn Féin to apologise for the IRA’s murder of census collector Joanne Mathers in . Mr Kearney said it was a “tragic killing and “a terrible act”.First census to be mainly onlineNext year’s census will be the first time that the household survey will largely be conducted online.Junior minister Gordon Lyons told the Assembly that would “make it easier for the majority of our population to fill in their s”. He said that around % of households will receive an initial invitation to take part online, with the remainder receiving a paper questionnaire – but they can also choose to take part online while those who want to fill in a paper form can request one.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

Regenerate, based in Portadown, has been allocated £, in the latest round of IFI funding. A total of £, has been pledged to support six groups across Northern Ireland and continue outreach work with marginalised communities.Pictured: Participants of the Regener project with coordinator, Tony McAleer. : User The funding will help sustain engagement efforts across local communities, develop capacity and ensure support for all throughout the current health crisis and beyond.The package was announced at a recent Board meeting and will be distributed across the Fund’s three core programmes, which all work with marginalised communities who have not previously or have only partially participated in peace and reconciliation activity.The Peace Impact Programme operates in areas with high levels of socio economic and social deprivation with a particular emphasis on engaging with disaffected youths who are more vulnerable to paramilitary recruitment. The unique Personal Youth Development Programme targets the most at risk - year olds who come from a range of complex backgrounds. IFI Chairperson, Paddy Harte commented on the funding: “The journey towards a peaceful society takes many forms and this funding is essential to help boost community spirit and leadership at an extremely challenging time.Keith McCann from Regenerate said: “During the current crisis we are working hard to deliver for our town. We have a telephone helpline working with over  people each week providing conversation, support and signposting to services. We are also working on new video content and running zoom online sessions to help reduce fear and anxiety. Finally, we are delivering food hampers and around  hot meals every week to those who need it the most. “For us, community engagement and support from the IFI is more crucial than ever. People are watching news and social media more and this information can often create fear within the community. Our work is very important and this funding will ensure we continue to keep connecting on a personal level and building trust with people.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
