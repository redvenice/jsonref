(Picture: AP)Theresa May said today she had authorised British forces to conduct precision air-launched cruise missile strikes on Syria to degrade its chemical weapons capability – adding that there ‘was no other choice’.Four Royal Air Force Tornado jets using Storm Shadow missiles had taken part in the attack on a military facility near Homs where it was assessed Syria had stockpiled chemicals, Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.It came after intelligence indicated Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government was responsible for an attack using chemical weapons in Douma last Saturday.The Prime Minister said the missile strike was designed to minimise any civilian casualties and was not an attempt to change the Syrian government.In a statement, she said: ‘This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change.’Smoke rises in Syria after US-led airstrikes targeting different parts of the Syrian capital Damascus (Picture: SANA AP)Britain’s defence ministry said initial indications were that the precision weapons and meticulous target planning had ‘resulted in a successful attack’May said Britain and the West had an obligation to deter both Assad and others from using chemical weapons after the poison gas attack in Douma near Damascus killed up to 75 people including children.‘So there is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime,’ she said.The Western missile strikes demonstrate the volatile nature of the Syrian civil war, which started in March 2011 as an anti-Assad uprising but is now a proxy conflict involving a number of world and regional powers and a myriad of insurgent groups.A picture released by the French Defence audiovisual communication and production unit (ECPAD) shows the launching of a cruise missile from a French military vessel in the Mediterranean sea towards targets in Syria overnight (Picture: AFP)US President Donald Trump said he was prepared to sustain the response until the government of Assad stopped its use of chemical weapons.Russia, which intervened in the war in 2015 to back Assad, has denied there was a chemical attack and has accused Britain of helping to stage the Douma incident to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.‘The facility which was struck is located some distance from any known concentrations of civilian habitation, reducing yet further any such risk,’ the MoD said in a statement.May said while the strike was targeted at Syria, it sent a message to anyone who used chemical weapons.Syrian soldiers hold their weapons as they dance and chant slogans against US President Trump during demonstrations following a wave of US, British and French military strikes to punish President Bashar Assad for suspected chemical attack against civilians (Picture: AP)Britain has accused Russia of being behind last month’s nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, southern England, a charge Moscow has rejected.‘This is the first time as prime minister that I have had to take the decision to commit our armed forces in combat and it is not a decision I have taken lightly,’ she said.‘We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world.’Many politicians in Britain, including some in May’s own Conservative Party, had called for parliament to be recalled from a break to give authority to any military strike.RAF Tornados taking-off on a sortie at RAF Akrotiri to conduct strikes in support of Operations over the Middle East (Picture: PA)Former Prime Minister David Cameron lost a parliamentary vote on air strikes against Assad’s forces in 2013 when 30 Conservative lawmakers voted against action, with many Britons wary of entering another conflict after intervention in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya failed to bring stability to the region.May is not obliged to win parliament’s approval before ordering military action, but a non-binding constitutional convention to do so has been established since a 2003 vote on joining the US-led invasion of Iraq.Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had said Britain should press for an independent U.N.-led investigation into the suspected chemical attack in Douma rather than wait for instructions from Trump on how to proceed.Former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, now head of humanitarian relief group the International Rescue Committee, said military action needed to be part of a wider political strategy.‘Bombing cannot substitute for diplomacy,’ he said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/09/17/4A5E4E4300000578-5595315-image-a-15_1523291174738.jpg","title":"Chloe Moretzs parents declared bankruptcy debts 5 487 891","story":"    Chloe Moretz\u0027s family lost everything when her parents declared bankruptcy in 2005, DailyMail.com can reveal.

Former homeless teenager Kai Fletcher, 18, pictured, is going to the wedding after turning his life around and now works with a charity to help rough sleepersKensington Palace announced the group would be among the crowds allowed into the grounds of Windsor Castle to share in the atmosphere of the May 19 wedding at St George\u0027s Chapel.Among those chosen are Philip Gillespie, 30, of Ballymena, Northern Ireland, who was a former section commander in the Royal Irish Regiment.The solider lost his right leg in 2010 aged just 22 four months into his third tour of Afghanistan when he stepped on an improvised explosive device (IED), needing three operations at Camp Bastion before he was airlifted to hospital in the UK for further treatment.Since then he has dedicated his life to charity, raising cash and awareness for ABG The Soldiers\u0027 Charity and has recently competed in team trials for rowing, swimming and archery at the next Invictus Games, set up by Prince Harry.Mr Gillespie said it is \u0027a wee bit surreal\u0027 to think he will be there next month with his girlfriend Kirsty Crawford. \u0027It\u0027s a massive privilege, it will be a huge spectacle,\u0027 he added.Others invited to attend include Reuben Litherland, 14, from Derby. The Saint Benedict Catholic Academy pupil, who is deaf, has set up a lunchtime sign language club at school.Jorja Furze, 12, has also been chosen for her work as ambassador for the Steel Bones charity which works with the amputee community.Jorja is an amputee from birth, having lost her left leg, but has overcome adversity to help others in similar situations.

Donald Trump, pictured, is also not invited to the wedding with the President yet to make an official visit to the UK          Prime Minister Theresa May is also off the list after the couple decided against inviting political leadersReports suggested that the Foreign Office was nervous about upsetting current president Donald Trump, who has still not visited the UK in an official capacity or met the Queen.Additionally, the royal family is supposed to remain neutral and above politics and no foreign heads of state were invited to Kate and William\u0027s wedding in 2011. \u0027There were religious leaders, members of the royal family, and commonwealth countries that were invited, \u0027he told townandcountry.com. \u0027I suspect that will be the same blueprint that Meghan and Harry will use. \u0027It\u0027s all very carefully orchestrated to make sure that there\u0027s no political overtones.\u0027

420 weed day","story":"    420 is an unofficial celebration of cannabis when people rally and call for its legalisationOrigins of 420Many people erroneously believe that the term 420 is a reference to several things including: the police code for the drug in the US the number in the California penal code that is about the distribution of marijuana the deaths and anniversaries of various celebrities including Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and Bob Marley the number of chemical compounds in cannabis.They are not: 420 is not even a code in the NYPD or the LAPD. San Francisco does have a 420 code, but it refers to ‘juvenile disturbance’, a tenuous connection at best. The California penal code does have a 420 section, but it refers to the unlawful prevention or obstruction of a person from entering public land.As for the births and deaths of musical luminaries: Bob Marley died on May 11 Joplin died in October Morrison in July Hendrix in September. Even the chemical composition for cannabis is out, coming in at 483 known compounds.          There are many theories regarding the provenance of the term 420 including that it\u0027s the police code for \u0027marijuana smoking in progress\u0027, though most have been debunkedHowever, that is not to say the most legitimate-sounding provenance is disappointing or in any way less delightful than the theories above.The term 420, quite appositely, is thought to have been created by a group of high school students looking to arrange a time to meet up, smoke marijuana and search for plot of land grow more of the cannabis plant.According to High Times, the cannabis magazine, in 1971 five students at the San Rafael High School in California decided to meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke marijuana by the school’s statue of Louis Pasteur. The password for the meeting was ‘420 Louis’. The five students called themselves ‘the Waldos’. The magazine then says the term faded into obscurity only to gloriously be brought back by a connection to the Grateful Dead band, at whose shows mysterious 420 flyers began popping up.In 1998, High Times officially declared the Waldos as the true creators of the term 420.Cannabis laws in the UKCannabis in the UK is classified as a Class B drug, alongside amphetamines like speed and certain opioids.People stopped for possession of cannabis for the first time get a written warning. A second offence may result in an on-the-spot fine while a third stop will result in an arrest.The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.          Though recreational cannabis isn\u0027t legal in the UK, many people smoke it in Hyde Park on 420Cannabis laws in the USThe tide against smoking of marijuana is slowly turning in the US. The drug was first legalised for recreational use in the US in 2012 with Colorado and Washington states.As of April 2018, nine states and Washington DC have legalised recreational use of marijuana: California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. Over half of all US states allow marijuana for medicinal use.Cannabis in AustraliaRecreational use of marijuana in Australia is currently illegal. If someone is caught in possession of marijuana, the punishments they face range from on-the-spot-fines to being charged with a criminal offence or even being sentenced to prison, depending on what state they are in. However, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is legal. In April 2018, the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt said: ‘Faster access, better access … there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,’.Britain\u0027s Got Talent 2018 Spoilers: Acts to watchHow to watch Beyonce at CoachellaCannes Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBritain\u0027s Got Talent 2018: Everything you need to knowACM Awards 2018: All you need to know about the country music awardsWhat is 420 and when is \u0027weed day\u0027?Sting and Shaggy album 44876 is comingLost in Space Netflix series: Everything you need to knowThe Sandlot cast reunite 25 years on ahead of 25th anniversaryCoachella 2018: Yodelling Walmart kid Mason Ramsey could perform with Post MaloneEndometriosis: What is it, what are the symptoms and how can it be treated?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/15/4B16D6D100000578-0-image-a-11_1523628639583.jpg","title":"Family 14 living four bedroom house mother claims evicted","story":"    Patricia Newman, 33, and her six children have moved into her mother\u0027s home - already occupied by seven other members of her familyDorothy, of Mersey Road in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, also shares her home with her two adult sons and their collective four children, over whom she has guardianship.The grandmother-of-ten said: \u0027Patricia and the children really need rehousing - the children need their own home with their mother.\u0027I have guardianship of four kids and it is hard work having that many children here.\u0027I am out looking after my mother who is seriously ill with heart problems among other illnesses.

It was a practice the president was aware of.\u0027We heard he had some proclivity to make tapes,\u0027 said one Trump adviser to the Washington Post, who spoke about the ongoing investigation.  The FBI raided Cohen\u0027s home, office and hotel on Monday. The products of the search warrants were handed to the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.        A view of 30 Rockefeller Center where Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump\u0027s long-time personal attorney, has an office that was searched Monday  Cohen pictured in front of his New York apartment building (left) and his hotel (right) both this weekIt is unknown if Cohen recorded his own conversations with Trump specifically. Cohen would frequently tout the New York law that only one party in the state had to consent to the taping of conversations.Trump himself previously boasted he taped people, even teasing that he had taped now former FBI Director James Comey.   \u0027James Comey better hope that there are no \u0027tapes\u0027 of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\u0027 Trump tweeted after stories surfaced saying Trump asked the former FBI director to pledge his loyalty before he fired Comey. The White House later acknowledged there weren\u0027t any tapes. Legal experts told the Post taped phone conversations are a gold mine for prosecutors. \u0027If you are looking for evidence, you can\u0027t do any better than people talking on tape,\u0027 said Nick Akerman, a former Watergate prosecutor. Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University who specializes in legal ethics expanded, saying that phone conversations are particularly significant.\u0027The significance is 9.5 to 10 on a 10-point scale,\u0027 he added, noting that investigators know \u0027that when people speak on the phone, they are not guarded.

The odds of an historic first win for a female jockey in the £1million Randox Health Grand National have been cut to 8-1.Rain that fell on the Aintree track on Friday turning part of the course heavy prompted three of the runners to pull out.But conditions will also particularly favour two of the three runners ridden by female jockeys - Baie Des Iles, the mount of by Katie Walsh, and Milansbar, who will be ridden by Bryony Frost. Rachael Blackmore, who rides Alpha Des Obeaux, is the other female jockey in the race. Baie Des Iles, a 50-1 shot early in the week, has been backed down to 16-1.

A blog on the site points out the differences between ‘sugar and prostitution’, claiming that sugar daddies and babies have an ongoing relationship, and not just a financial transaction.It also claims that women on the site are not sexually abused as in prostitution and that sex is an aspiration, not a requirement. Yet evidence from women who spoke to the MoS tells a very different story. They claim that they were treated like prostitutes after signing up.A young single mother joined SA while she was a student at a Scottish university. She wanted extra money to cover her university costs while also supporting her four-year-old daughter. What turned out to be her only dates arranged through the website were with a 56-year-old man.At their first meeting, he paid for dinner and took her to the upmarket women’s clothing shop he owned, allowing her to take home any of the expensive dresses that caught her eye. But on the second date, the mood changed after he made clear to her that on the third date he expected sex. When she declined, he became enraged and began to reel off the explicit sexual services other women he had dated through Seeking Arrangement had provided him.She said: ‘I remember a particular phrase he used. He said, “This Asian girl bent over.” I remember feeling so shocked with the realisation that he expected sex. I thought, “Oh my God, this is completely screwed up.” So I just dropped him, deleted my profile from the site and got out.#IBelieveHer protesters claim victory as Irish and Ulster...Share this article‘I was naive and I did think it was a free lunch. I thought maybe you had to be seen with these men or they wanted a date for an event, a high-class escort type thing. I had no idea it was prostitution.’ The rise of university tuition fees has been beneficial for SA’s recruitment and the company aggressively markets itself to students, claiming in 2016 that more than 250,000 UK students had registered as sugar babies.Undaunted by such adverse publicity, this weekend the company is proudly hosting its latest Sugar Baby Summit in New York. In adverts for the event it says that sugar daddies, sugar babies and psychologists will all be in attendance to advise young women who attend on ‘how to bag a millionaire’.          This Cambridge PhD student said she was funding her life at university through Seeking ArrangementsShe said during the meal he plied her with copious amounts of wine, before inviting her back to his penthouse apartment where he then encouraged her to take cocaine and smoke marijuana with him.From here he cajoled her to go out on to his balcony where he forced her into a sex act with a beer bottle.On another occasion she was inundated with messages from a 70-year-old man in Brighton who offered to pay her £1,000 to have unprotected sex.The woman said she did not report the sexual assault to the police for fear of her family or friends finding out that she had sex for money.She has now left the site, but revealed the experience had left her feeling ashamed and deeply emotionally scarred. She said: ‘If a woman still thinks there is possibility of “normal dating” after signing up, she will soon understand that Seeking Arrangement and sites like it are platforms for prostitution.‘Every single interaction with men was quickly – usually after a few lines – very explicit on what they want and the price.‘All of them really quickly want nude pictures.

A Russian attack in the next two to three weeks is a high threat. And it will be an attack on national infrastructure, not just upsetting city firms, but getting inside the transport system, or the health system, or air traffic control. It could affect everyone. One of the biggest concerns is an air crash,\u0027 according to the Mirror.Such cyber attacks could see electricity cuts, while Russian hackers could also disable water supplies, as well as energy grid and financial services being crippled suddenly. The concerns come as the first poll carried out after yesterday\u0027s raids showed that the public believe Mrs May\u0027s action was wrong by a majority of almost two to one.And six out of ten say there must be no more missile strikes unless she wins the backing of MPs – with only one in five in favour of her going it alone again.

They launched Storm Shadow missiles at a military facility          Fighter jet landing at Akrotiri military British Royal Air Force Base, Cyprus following strikes on Syrian chemical weapons basesShe is the most trusted Prime Minister to lead the nation into war since Margaret Thatcher, beating David Cameron and Tony Blair. Ordering military action for the first time since entering No 10, a sombre Mrs May used a 9am Downing Street press conference to insist the bombing was the \u0027right thing to do\u0027 to stop the use of banned chemical weapons. She denied Britain was interfering in Syria\u0027s long and bloody civil war.In a letter to MPs, the Prime Minister was defiant, saying: \u0027This action is absolutely in Britain\u0027s national interest. The lesson of history is that when the global rules and standards that keep us safe come under threat, we must take a stand and defend them.\u0027President Trump\u0027s triumphant \u0027mission accomplished\u0027 declaration followed the US-led coalition\u0027s launch of 105 cruise missiles at three chemical weapons factories and storage depots across Syria. The comments echoed George W. Bush\u0027s premature declaration of victory over Iraq in 2003.The Pentagon said all of its targets had been hit, despite Syria and its key ally Russia claiming that most of the missiles had been shot down by air defences, while the rest only hit disused or empty sites. The air strikes were launched a week to the day after an estimated 75 people were killed and a further 500 injured, including young children, in the suspected chemical weapons attack on Douma, a suburb of the capital Damascus.Western intelligence agencies gathered evidence that convinced political leaders that the Assad regime was to blame, including observations of an army helicopter over the city, while aid workers told how chlorine could be smelled in the air and victims were found with foam in their mouth and with burning eyes.The White House said last night that in addition to chlorine, the nerve agent sarin was also used in Douma. It said doctors and aid organisations on the ground reported the \u0027strong smell of chlorine and described symptoms consistent with exposure to sarin\u0027.          The view from Damascus as the US and allies launched reprisals after the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime  The Akrotiri military British Royal Air Force Base on Cyrus where the British planes flew missions from last night          The Ministry of Defence confirmed they fired Storm Shadow cruise missiles (file picture) at a military facility – a former missile base – some fifteen miles west of Homs          A French air force Rafale fighter jet prepares to take off on its mission against Assad after President Macron saw evidence of Syrian war crimesA senior administration official said the US had \u0027significant information that points to sarin use\u0027.President Trump gave the first warning of the attack on Wednesday when he tweeted that Russia should \u0027get ready\u0027 because \u0027nice and new and smart\u0027 missiles would be coming. He also told Vladimir Putin he should not be \u0027partners with a Gas Killing Animal\u0027.At some time after 1am UK time yesterday, four GR4 Tornado aircraft bristling with the latest military hardware took off under the cover of darkness from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus.The sorties followed several hours of briefings and meticulous assessments of the chemical weapons site by RAF crews and operational planners, intended to rule out civilian casualties.Pictures released last night by the Ministry of Defence showed the tense final preparations at Akrotiri before the operation was finally launched, including a Flight Lieutenant dressed in a flying suit and carrying a pistol holster around his shoulder inspecting an ASRAAM air-to-air missile attached to the wing of one of the Tornados.Each Tornado was flown by a two-man crew drawn from the RAF\u0027s 31 Squadron, nicknamed the Gold Stars. These personnel form part of 903 Expeditionary Air Wing (EAW) based at Akrotiri. Crews have been conducting air strikes against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria since 2015.Shortly after 2am yesterday the pilots and weapons systems officers aboard the Tornados released their payloads of Storm Shadow missiles, each costing £750,000, as President Trump announced that military operations against Syria had begun.          David Cameron, who lost a Commons vote on military action against the Syrian regime in 2013, said he backed the strikes. DUP leader Arlene Foster also welcomed it as \u0027proportionate and justified\u0027          Before and after images provided by the Pentagon show how the targets selected were obliterated in the raids by the allies against Assad\u0027s regimeIn order to avoid attack from Russian-made rocket systems operated by Syria, the RAF jets remained in international airspace throughout the operation. The missiles have a range of 155 miles and travelled 100 miles. At no time was the safety of the RAF crews endangered. It is understood that all eight British missiles found their targets and caused significant destruction.Last night the MoD said: \u0027Very careful scientific analysis was applied to determine where best to target the Storm Shadows to maximise the destruction of the stockpiled chemicals and to minimise any risks of contamination to the surrounding area.\u0027The facility struck is located some distance from any known concentrations of civilian habitation, reducing yet further any such risk.\u0027Our action was proportionate, specifically aimed at degrading the regime\u0027s ability to use chemical weapons and deterring further such appalling acts.\u0027 The same storage facility was also targeted by nine US Tomahawk missiles fired from a US Navy warship in the Red Sea, three French naval cruise missiles and two Scalp cruise missiles fired from Rafale fighter jets.The US also launched a huge attack on a chemical weapons laboratory in Damascus thought by intelligence sources to have been involved in the production of sarin and other deadly nerve agents used by the Assad regime.At around 2am, 57 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 19 high explosive bombs were dropped on the Barzeh Research and Development facility with devastating results.Early on Saturday US time, President Trump wrote on Twitter: \u0027A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!\u0027Commentators were quick to point out that President Bush stood on an aircraft carrier under a huge \u0027Mission Accomplished\u0027 banner just six weeks after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, but came to regret it, as what followed was a war that cost the lives of hundreds of US and UK soldiers. But Pentagon spokesman Dana White backed Mr Trump\u0027s slogan, saying: \u0027We hit the sites, the heart of the chemical weapons programme. So it was mission accomplished.\u0027In a detailed briefing, the US military revealed that 105 missiles obliterated three Syrian regime chemical weapons sites in a \u0027precise, overwhelming and effective\u0027 attack.Barzeh was the primary target, razed to the ground by 57 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 19 JASSM \u0027smart bombs\u0027 – used in combat for the first time. The second target was Him Shinshar, flattened by the eight Storm Shadow missiles from RAF Tornados, which were escorted by Typhoon fighter jets. It was also hit by nine US missiles and five French missiles.The third target was a nearby chemical weapons bunker, pounded with seven Scalp missiles.Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie Jr, staff director of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said all missiles fired by Allied forces hit their targets shortly after 4am local time, and denied claims made by Russia and Syria that dozens were shot out of the sky by Soviet-era air defence missiles.          In the early hours UK time, Donald Trump said he had ordered \u0027precision strikes\u0027 on Syria in retaliation for the \u0027evil and despicable\u0027 poison gas attack that killed at least 75 people on April 7 (a young victim is pictured)          The British missions against targets in Syria were launched the RAF Akrotiri base near Limassol on Cyprus in the early hoursHe added: \u0027None of our aircraft or missiles involved in this operation were successfully engaged by Syrian air defences and we have no indication that Russian air defence systems were deployed.\u0027He said Syrian air defence systems fired back \u0027indiscriminately\u0027 only after the devastating strike mission.He said: \u0027Over 40 surface-to-air missiles were deployed by the Syrian regime. Most of these launches were conducted after the last impact of our strike was over. We assess that the defensive efforts of Syria were largely ineffective.\u0027Syrian TV broadcast images of the ruins of the scientific research centre that was reduced to rubble, but the regime claimed the attack had little impact.Assad loyalists took to the streets of Damascus waving flags and mocking Mr Trump, while a Twitter account run by President Assad\u0027s office posted a video of him walking calmly through the presidential palace.No further sorties were expected by the US or its allies today.But arguments still raged over the legitimacy of the strikes as well as the truth behind the deaths in rebel-controlled Douma.At a meeting of the UN Security Council last night called at Russia\u0027s request, Mr Putin\u0027s envoy called the air strikes an \u0027act of aggression\u0027, while UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged restraint to \u0027avoid escalation\u0027. The military operation was denounced as a \u0027crime\u0027 by Iran\u0027s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but welcomed by Turkey\u0027s President Erdogan as sending a message to Assad that his massacre would not go unpunished.German Chancellor Angela Merkel called it \u0027necessary and appropriate\u0027 even though her country did not join in, while Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he backed the action.In Syria, the opposition was braced for revenge attacks, particularly in rebel-held territory in the north-west. \u0027Maybe the regime will not use chemical weapons, but it will not hesitate to use weapons,\u0027 opposition leader Nasr al-Hariri said.Britain braces for Russian cyber attacks targeting transport links, water supplies, hospitals and airports - Mirror Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/23/4B25964500000578-0-image-m-21_1523746511328.jpg","title":"Homeland star David Harewood I don t need Enoch Powell s speech analysed","story":"The anti-immigration speech, which will be read out in segments by actor Ian McDiarmid, was first delivered to local Conservative party members in Birmingham, ahead of a second reading of the 1968 race relations bill (Enoch Powell, pictured in 1979)Powell attacked the government\u0027s immigration policy, called for less immigration and urged those already in the UK to return to their country of origin.But listeners are split over whether the programme it was insensitive or insightful.The speech referred to a white constituent who feared \u0027the black man having the whip hand over the white man\u0027 and ended by ominously predicting rivers of blood. Jeremy Corbyn questions legality of Syria attacks and...There\u0027s a lot more to the story than what’s being told\u0027:...Share this articleThe BBC has said the broadcast was a \u0027rigorous journalistic analysis of a historical political speech\u0027 and \u0027not an endorsement of the controversial views\u0027.‏Some listeners welcomed the broadcast.Paul Embery wrote on Twitter: \u0027Archive on 4 about Enoch Powell, was insightful, sensitive, analytical and balanced.

She set herself standards and she knew what she did and didn\u0027t want to be associated with very early on, long before Prince Harry,\u0027 explains Gina.\u0027She was always very conscious and protective of her image and rightly didn\u0027t want to do anything that would compromise that. She was already developing her role in Suits, but it was clear to me from the start that she expected to become an even bigger star.\u0027          If it is a \u0027yes\u0027 to human rights, environmentalism and gender equality – Meghan, 36, is a United Nations women\u0027s advocate – it is also a clear \u0027no\u0027 to promoting fur or animal products, and certainly a \u0027no\u0027 to anything that might make the star look, well, ordinarySay no to the SultanAn early indicator of Meghan\u0027s careful approach came on one of her first trips to the UK, where Gina and Kruger Cowne arranged for Meghan to stay at The Dorchester, the Park Lane hotel favoured by celebs and Royals.Plans were in place for Ms Markle – who insisted on using an alias even though most Britons at that point had barely heard of her – to check in for free at the five-star hotel where rooms start from £400. It was an offer for which most clients would \u0027give their eye teeth\u0027, says Gina.          Meghan Markle will join Prince Harry at two key Commonwealth events next week ahead of the Royal wedding on May 19 It came as something of a surprise to her hosts, then, when Meghan wrote to say it simply would not do. It was in conflict with her personal beliefs. The owner, the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah – whose Dorchester Collection includes the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA and the Le Meurice in Paris – had recently suggested sharia punishments should be meted out to adulterers and those found to be homosexual. Women who had abortions would be flogged in public.Gina said: \u0027Meghan emailed to say she would never stay at the Dorchester, or any hotels they are involved with. We understood and of course agreed.\u0027Her stance may well have softened since meeting Prince Harry. After all, she broke her boycott last May to watch her Prince play polo at the Sultan\u0027s vast Cosworth Park estate in Ascot.And this is probably just as well as far as the Royal Family is concerned. The Sultan was a guest at the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011.In December last year, Prince William welcomed the Sultan at Buckingham Palace and in November the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall made an official visit to the nation where he took tea with the Brunei Royal Family and senior government ministers.Make that picture perfectNo one understands the power of visual imagery better than Meghan, and like her future sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, Meghan is a keen amateur photographer, says Gina. And a painstaking one.\u0027Most photographs she put on her lifestyle blog, The Tig, were taken herself.\u0027She would see something she wanted to photograph and she would frame the shot expertly. If she was going to be in the photograph, she would hand the camera to someone and direct them, saying, \u0027Stand here and point it over there.\u0027 \u0027Let parrots fly freeIt wasn\u0027t just The Dorchester that met with a degree of disapproval. Gina remembers when Meghan checked in and out of a hotel in Knightsbridge without ever staying the night.Gina says: \u0027One time we booked her into the Jumeirah Carlton Tower and I had to meet her there to go on to a meeting.\u0027My colleague and I walked to her room and en route was this parrot sitting in a cage and Meghan looked at this parrot and looked at my colleague and said, \u0027I can\u0027t stay here because of the parrot.\u0027 She there and then checked out and went to the Soho Hotel.\u0027I realise that she\u0027s absolutely right, of course. Wild animals belong in the wild and not in cages.\u0027Tips from Harry – PotterMeghan has been determined to combine her career with humanitarian causes, particularly women\u0027s rights, and was impressed by one actress in particular – Harry Potter actress Emma Watson.\u0027On one occasion, Meghan and I attended an event where Emma, a committed feminist, was speaking,\u0027 says Gina. \u0027I could tell Meghan was quite taken with Emma\u0027s passion and commitment to her cause. I\u0027m sure she was looking at her thinking, \u0027Emma is doing this, so can I.\u0027\u0027Meghan very much wants to be a role model.\u0027Gina says that one of Meghan\u0027s greatest achievements was delivering a United Nations Women\u0027s speech in New York, where Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General at the time, stood up and thanked her and shook her hand.Meghan, whose mother Doria was in the audience, told Gina afterwards: \u0027I just could have died happy in that moment!\u0027          Miss Markle (pictured with Prince Harry at team trials for the Invictus Games in Bath) will join her fiancée at the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London on Wednesday and a Women\u0027s Empowerment reception on Thursday, hosted by the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson Don\u0027t beat about the bush\u0027She absolutely knows her own mind,\u0027 recalls Gina. \u0027At one point we were putting together a proposal for a book based on her lifestyle blog The Tig and if she didn\u0027t like part of the plan, she would tell you straight out.\u0027In the end, it wasn\u0027t published because she met Harry and obviously decided it wasn\u0027t the sort of thing she should be pursuing right now.\u0027There were people in the office she didn\u0027t gel with and she said it straight, \u0027I\u0027m not working with so and so any more.\u0027 There was no beating around the bush.\u0027It could be awkward but my job is all about building relationships so I understood where she was coming from.\u0027Dream Big – it worksWas it written in the stars? Her dream of bagging a prince was certainly written in her blog, The Tig.At about the time of Kate\u0027s wedding to Prince William in 2011, she says: \u0027Little girls dream of being princesses. And grown women seem to retain this childhood fantasy. Just look at the pomp and circumstance surrounding the Royal Wedding and endless conversation about Princess Kate.\u0027Humorous no doubt, but prophetic also. Then, referring to a popular children\u0027s cartoon, she continues: \u0027I, for one, was all about She-Ra, Princess of Power.\u0027Harry might take note."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/15/00/4B2B69D800000578-5616915-image-a-10_1523749563554.jpg","title":"Drink driver goes run ploughing group revellers Blackpool","story":"    Police have arrested a \u0027drunk\u0027 driver who removed his car number plates and ploughed into a group of revellers after being ejected from a bar          Local officers are hunting the clubgoer, who abandoned his silver car and made off on foot          Some clubs remain in lockdown - as local officers hunted the clubgoer, who abandoned his silver car and made off on footLocal officers hunted the clubgoer, who abandoned his silver car and made off on foot.Many revellers say some clubs and pubs still remain in lockdown.Social media users were quick to react to the chaotic scenes, with one saying: \u0027Currently stuck in a club in Blackpool.

Now Rovelli is back to explore the mysteries of time. He tells  Charlotte Higgins about student revolution and how his quantum leap began with an acid trip• Extract from Carlo Rovelli’s new book: on the elastic concept of time What do we know about time? Language tells us that it “passes”, it moves like a great river, inexorably dragging us with it, and, in the end, washes us up on its shore while it continues, unstoppable. Time flows. It moves ever forwards. Or does it? Poets also tell us that time stumbles or creeps or slows or even, at times, seems to stop. They tell us that the past might be inescapable, immanent in objects or people or landscapes. When Juliet is waiting for Romeo, time passes sluggishly: she longs for Phaethon to take the reins of the Sun’s chariot, since he would whip up the horses and “bring in cloudy night immediately”. When we wake from a vivid dream we are dimly aware that the sense of time we have just experienced is illusory.Carlo Rovelli is an Italian theoretical physicist who wants to make the uninitiated grasp the excitement of his field. His book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, with its concise, sparkling essays on subjects such as black holes and quanta, has sold 1.3m copies worldwide. Now comes The Order of Time, a dizzying, poetic work in which I found myself abandoning everything I thought I knew about time – certainly the idea that it “flows”, and even that it exists at all, in any profound sense.We meet outside the church of San Petronio in Bologna, where Rovelli studied. (“I like to say that, just like Copernicus, I was an undergraduate at Bologna and a graduate at Padua,” he jokes.) A cheery, compact fellow in his early 60s, Rovelli is in nostalgic mood. He lives in Marseille, where, since 2010, he has run the quantum gravity group at the Centre de physique théorique. Before that, he was in the US, at the University of Pittsburgh, for a decade.He rarely visits Bologna, and he has been catching up with old friends. We wander towards the university area. Piazza Verdi is flocked with a lively crowd of students. There are flags and graffiti and banners, too – anti-fascist slogans, something in support of the Kurds, a sign enjoining passers-by not to forget Giulio Regeni, the Cambridge PhD student killed in Egypt in 2016.“In my day it was barricades and police,” he says. He was a passionate student activist, back then. What did he and his pals want? “Small things! We wanted a world without boundaries, without state, without war, without religion, without family, without school, without private property.”He was, he says now, too radical, and it was hard, trying to share possessions, trying to live without jealousy. And then there was the LSD. He took it a few times. And it turned out to be the seed of his interest in physics generally, and in the question of time specifically. “It was an extraordinarily strong experience that touched me also intellectually,” he remembers. “Among the strange phenomena was the sense of time stopping. Things were happening in my mind but the clock was not going ahead the flow of time was not passing any more. It was a total subversion of the structure of reality. He had hallucinations of misshapen objects, of bright and dazzling colours – but also recalls thinking during the experience, actually asking himself what was going on.“And I thought: ‘Well, it’s a chemical that is changing things in my brain. But how do I know that the usual perception is right, and this is wrong? If these two ways of perceiving are so different, what does it mean that one is the correct one?’” The way he talks about LSD is, in fact, quite similar to his description of reading Einstein as a student, on a sun-baked Calabrian beach, and looking up from his book imagining the world not as it appeared to him every day, but as the wild and undulating spacetime that the great physicist described. Reality, to quote the title of one of his books, is not what it seems.He gave his conservative, Veronese parents a bit of a fright, he says. His father, now in his 90s, was surprised when young Carlo’s lecturers said he was actually doing all right, despite the long hair and radical politics and the occasional brush with the police. It was after the optimistic sense of student revolution in Italy came to an abrupt end with the kidnapping and murder of the former prime minister, Aldo Moro, in 1978 that Rovelli began to take physics seriously. But his route to his big academic career was circuitous and unconventional. “Nowadays everyone is worried because there is no work. When I was young, the problem was how to avoid work. I did not want to become part of the ‘productive system’,” he says.Academia, then, seemed like a way of avoiding the world of a conventional job, and for some years he followed his curiosity without a sense of careerist ambition. He went to Trento in northern Italy to join a research group he was interested in, sleeping in his car for a few months (“I’d get a shower in the department to be decent”). He went to London, because he was interested in the work of Chris Isham, and then to the US, to be near physicists such as Abhay Ashtekar and Lee Smolin. “My first paper was horrendously late compared to what a young person would have to do now. And this was a privilege – I knew more things, there was more time.”The popular books, too, have come relatively late, after his academic study of quantum gravity, published in 2004. If Seven Brief Lessons was a lucid primer, The Order of Time takes things further it deals with “what I really do in science, what I really think in depth, what is important for me”.Rovelli’s work as a physicist, in crude terms, occupies the large space left by Einstein on the one hand, and the development of quantum theory on the other. If the theory of general relativity describes a world of curved spacetime where everything is continuous, quantum theory describes a world in which discrete quantities of energy interact. In Rovelli’s words, “quantum mechanics cannot deal with the curvature of spacetime, and general relativity cannot account for quanta”.Both theories are successful but their apparent incompatibility is an open problem, and one of the current tasks of theoretical physics is to attempt to construct a conceptual framework in which they both work. Rovelli’s field of loop theory, or loop quantum gravity, offers a possible answer to the problem, in which spacetime itself is understood to be granular, a fine structure woven from loops.String theory offers another, different route towards solving the problem. When I ask him what he thinks about the possibility that his loop quantum gravity work may be wrong, he gently explains that being wrong isn’t the point being part of the conversation is the point. And anyway, “If you ask who had the longest and most striking list of results it’s Einstein without any doubt. But if you ask who is the scientist who made most mistakes, it’s still Einstein.”How does time fit in to his work? Time, Einstein long ago showed, is relative – time passes more slowly for an object moving faster than another object, for example. In this relative world, an absolute “now” is more or less meaningless. Time, then, is not some separate quality that impassively flows around us. Time is, in Rovelli’s words, “part of a complicated geometry woven together with the geometry of space”.For Rovelli, there is more: according to his theorising, time itself disappears at the most fundamental level. His theories ask us to accept the notion that time is merely a function of our “blurred” human perception. We see the world only through a glass, darkly we are watching Plato’s shadow-play in the cave. According to Rovelli, our undeniable experience of time is inextricably linked to the way heat behaves. In The Order of Time, he asks why can we know only the past, and not the future? The key, he suggests, is the one-directional flow of heat from warmer objects to colder ones. An ice cube dropped into a hot cup of coffee cools the coffee. But the process is not reversible: it is a one-way street, as demonstrated by the second law of thermodynamics.Time is also, as we experience it, a one-way street. He explains it in relation to the concept of entropy – the measure of the disordering of things. Entropy was lower in the past. Entropy is higher in the future – there is more disorder, there are more possibilities. The pack of cards of the future is shuffled and uncertain, unlike the ordered and neatly arranged pack of cards of the past. But entropy, heat, past and future are qualities that belong not to the fundamental grammar of the world but to our superficial observation of it. “If I observe the microscopic state of things,” writes Rovelli, “then the difference between past and future vanishes … in the elementary grammar of things, there is no distinction between ‘cause’ and ‘effect’.”To understand this properly, I can suggest only that you read Rovelli’s books, and pass swiftly over this approximation by someone who gave up school physics lessons joyfully at the first possible opportunity. However, it turns out that I am precisely Rovelli’s perfect reader, or one of them, and he looks quite delighted when I check my newly acquired understanding of the concept of entropy with him. (“You passed the exam,” he says.)“I try to write at several levels,” he explains. “I think about the person who not only doesn’t know anything about physics but is also not interested. So I think I am talking to my grandmother, who was a housekeeper. I also think some young students of physics are reading it, and I also think some of my colleagues are reading it. So I try to talk at different levels, but I keep the person who knows nothing in my mind.”His biggest fans are the blank slates, like me, and his colleagues at universities – he gets most criticism from people in the middle, “those who know a bit of physics”. He is also pretty down on school physics. (“Calculating the speed at which a ball drops – who cares? In another life, I’d like to write a school physics book,” he says.) And he thinks the ision of the world into the “two cultures” of natural sciences and human sciences is “stupid. It’s like taking England and iding the kids into groups, and you tell one group about music, and one group about literature, and the one who gets music is not allowed to read novels and the one who does literature is not allowed to listen to music.”The joy of his writing is its broad cultural compass. Historicism gives an initial hand-hold on the material. (He teaches a course on history of science, where he likes to bring science and humanities students together.) And then there’s the fact that alongside Einstein, Ludwig Boltzmann and Roger Penrose appear figures such as Proust, Dante, Beethoven, and, especially, Horace – each chapter begins with an epigraph from the Roman poet – as if to ground us in human sentiment and emotion before departing for the vertiginous world of black holes and spinfoam and clouds of probabilities.“He has a side that is intimate, lyrical and extremely intense and he is the great singer of the passing of time,” Rovelli says. “There’s a feeling of nostalgia – it’s not anguish, it’s not sorrow – it’s a feeling of ‘Let’s live life intensely’. A good friend of mine, Ernesto, who died quite young, gave me a little book of Horace, and I have carried it around with me all my life.”Rovelli’s view is that there is no contradiction between a vision of the universe that makes human life seem small and irrelevant, and our everyday sorrows and joys. Or indeed between “cold science” and our inner, spiritual lives. “We are part of nature, and so joy and sorrow are aspects of nature itself – nature is much richer than just sets of atoms,” he tells me. There’s a moment in Seven Lessons when he compares physics and poetry: both try to describe the unseen. It might be added that physics, when departing from its native language of mathematical equations, relies strongly on metaphor and analogy. Rovelli has a gift for memorable comparisons. He tells us, for example, when explaining that the smooth “flow” of time is an illusion, that “The events of the world do not form an orderly queue like the English, they crowd around chaotically like the Italians.” The concept of time, he says, “has lost layers one after another, piece by piece”. We are left with “an empty windswept landscape almost devoid of all trace of temporality … a world stripped to its essence, glittering with an arid and troubling beauty”.More than anything else I’ve ever read, Rovelli reminds me of Lucretius, the first-century BCE Roman author of the epic-length poem, On the Nature of Things. Perhaps not so odd, since Rovelli is a fan. Lucretius correctly hypothesised the existence of atoms, a theory that would remain unproven until Einstein demonstrated it in 1905, and even as late as the 1890s was being written off as absurd. What Rovelli shares with Lucretius is not only a brilliance of language, but also a sense of humankind’s place in nature – at once a part of the fabric of the universe, and in a particular position to marvel at its great beauty. It’s a rationalist view: one that holds that by better understanding the universe, by discarding false beliefs and superstition, one might be able to enjoy a kind of serenity. Though Rovelli the man also acknowledges that the stuff of humanity is love, and fear, and desire, and passion: all made meaningful by our brief lives our tiny  of allotted time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfe474551f5de9d3f152a8bc0565a5f08a0ccb51/0_264_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9c1be7e199be80eab919096bbaa98529 1240w","title":"lionel shriver property metoo cultural appropriation","story":"Lionel Shriver is a US writer and journalist whose novels include So Much For That, The Post-Birthday World, The Mandibles: A Family, 2029-2047 and the bestselling We Need to Talk About Kevin, which won the 2005 Orange prize and was turned into a film by Lynne Ramsay, starring Tilda Swinton. In 2014, she won the BBC national short story award. She lives in London and Brooklyn. Her latest book is Property, a themed collection of stories and two novellas.Were the stories in your new book written by design to be read alongside one another or did they just accrue over time?I’d written the novella, The Subletter, and wanted to give it a home. So you could say they were accrued by design: every time I got a commission, I made sure the story had something to do with property. I’m interested in the way in which what we own becomes a projection of the self – and in territory, too, literally and metaphorically. I’m very territorial, particularly about my study. If my husband wants to park his drums in there, I’ll tolerate it in the short term, but I would never allow it in the long term.How do you feel about the seemingly endless debate regarding short stories and whether or not they are enjoying a revival?It’s utterly boring. I’m sick of it, and I think readers are, too. This whole conversation about form is tedious and we should stop having it. There is some appetite for the short story, but like lots of people I would rather read a novel that’s another reason why I themed Property, so it’s more of a unified experience.Do you think immigration is one of the subjects of our time?It’s the subject of the century, and it needs to be talked about with robustness and immediacy, and it is underexplored in literature. For obvious structural reasons, fiction is almost exclusively concerned with the experience of the immigrant and has no time for the native-born person whose world is being transformed. The immigrant is the risk-taker, the adventurer and the party who is at a disadvantage, whereas the native-born person is selfish and looks bigoted and mean. How do you write about that? I’ve just had a little rant, but I’ve never followed my own advice. I don’t know if I ever would write it. It’s too dangerous.What about #MeToo? Is it already having an effect both on fiction, and the way we read it?I’m not inclined to join bandwagons. I don’t like crowds I always want to step back. I am dismayed by critics and readers who approach literature in the spirit of Sunday school. We’re judging authors: he put his hand on the wrong knee. From there, you’re only a hop, skip and a jump away from not being able to have your characters put their hands on the wrong knees. I don’t read novels with a prissy little pen in my hand, looking for sinning characters who don’t live up to certain political expectations. What a boring way of reading books.What books might people be surprised to see on your shelves?Cookbooks: a fair whack of them. But aside from heading to Betty Crocker for “canary corn sticks”, I hardly ever consult them. I prefer my messy files of clippings, scrawled with my own notes (“multiply chilli flakes by four”). By comparison, recipes in books always feel a little dead.Which writer do you always return to, and why?Richard Yates. One of the few writers who rewards rereading. He is both cruel and forgiving with his characters. I regard him as something between a role model and a kindred spirit.What was the last great novel you read?Amy Bloom’s White Houses. She really brings Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt to life as regular people, not icons.What kind of reader were you as a child?Voracious and indiscriminate. Prone to obsessive phases.

He stepped down on 14 April“As I look ahead, I see that the current disruption we are experiencing is simply putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business,” said Sorrell. “That is why I have decided that in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all share owners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside. “As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that. Good fortune and Godspeed to all of you … now Back to the Future.”Sorrell, one of Britain’s best-known business leaders, and the longest-serving FTSE 100 chief executive, has been under increasing pressure since the allegation of personal misconduct was made public by WPP’s board earlier this month.WPP’s board, which had appointed independent legal counsel to investigate the allegation, was expected to receive the findings of the investigation at the end of next week.Roberto Quarta, the WPP chairman, has taken the role of executive chairman until a replacement for Sorrell can be found.WPP has moved to appoint longstanding WPP executives from ad group Wunderman – Mark Read and Andrew Scott – as joint chief operating officers to run day-to-day operations.WPP said that Sorrell will be “available to assist with the transition”.“For the past 33 years, I have spent every single day thinking about the future of WPP,” said Sorrell. “We have had a succession plan in place for some time. We have weathered difficult storms in the past. And our highly talented people have always won through, always. As some of you know, my family has expanded recently, WPP will always be my baby too.”Quarta has said there is an “exceptional team of potential candidates” from WPP’s top management, as well as a “constantly refined list of external candidates”. However, investors and analysts believe that, given the scale of WPP, Sorrell’s successor must be an external candidate.WPP employs over 200,000 staff in more than 400 separate advertising businesses working in over 3,000 offices in 112 countries.Whoever takes on WPP will find keeping the sprawling empire – autocratically run with an iron hand with what has been dubbed “Sorrellcentricity” – intact perhaps an impossible task.Observers believe that Sorrell’s departure will have rapid and catastrophic ramifications for WPP and the wider global advertising eco-system. “Martin falls, WPP falls,” said one top advertising executive at a rival global holding company. “There will be chaos. The industry is not prepared, clients are not prepared. In the short term there will be chaos. The advertising industry is run like show business, it’s all about short-termism and that’s the problem.” Sorrell has come under increasing pressure in the last year as WPP, which has a market capitalisation of £15bn, has struggled resulting in its share price falling more than a third – wiping £9bn off the value of the business. WPP recently reported its worst performance since the advertising recession in 2009, which Sorrell described as “not a pretty year”.Sorrell is one of the UK’s best-paid business leaders earning more than £200m from pay and lucrative – and highly controversial – reward schemes in the last five years alone. His £70m payout in 2015 was one of the biggest in UK corporate history.To everyone at WPP, For the past 33 years, I have spent every single day thinking about the future of WPP. Over those decades, our family has grown and prospered. We welcomed J. Walter Thompson, Ogilvy, Young \u0026amp Rubicam, Grey, 247 Real Media, Taylor Nelson Sofres, among so many others. We created GroupM, including Xaxis and Essence. We put the focus on Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East and Central Eastern Europe, the home of the next billion consumers. We embarked on the early development of digital capabilities and the evolution of a firm-wide integrated client and country-centered approach. Our holding company was recognized as the world’s best and most effective through the Cannes Lions and Effie Awards year after year after year.We pioneered Atticus Awards for original written thinking…. the WPP Fellowship Awards to recognize promising talent…. the Partnership and Practice Awards for client endorsed integrated market and case studies. Our Stream digital conferences have attracted the best in the digital business for more than a decade.Our Annual Sustainability and Pro Bono Reports highlight the unique social, environmental and public policy work that we do day in, day out across the globe.  As I look ahead, I see that the current disruption we are experiencing is simply putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business, our over 200,000 people and their 500,000 or so dependents, and the clients we serve in 112 countries.  That is why I have decided that in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all shareowners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside. We have had a succession plan in place for some time. A new generation of management, led by Mark Read and Andrew Scott (who have each been at WPP for approximately 20 years), are well qualified and experienced in the Board’s opinion, to deal with the geographic and technological opportunities and challenges our industry faces.We have weathered difficult storms in the past. And our highly talented people have always won through, always.Nobody, either direct competitors or newly-minted ones can beat the WPP team, as long as you work closely together, whether by client andor country or digitally. In the coming period, I will be available to the Board and any of you, should you want help with anything, anywhere. I shall miss all of you greatly. You have given me such excitement and energy and I wanted to thank you for everything you have done and will do for WPP and me. As some of you know, my family has expanded recently, WPP will always be my baby too.As a Founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that.

Every two or three days, a new crater appears in the Italian capital’s asphalt. They’re normally the size of a small room, a few metres wide and a few metres deep. In February, though, six cars were sucked down into the bowels of the earth when 50 metres of via Livio Andronico fell away, causing entire buildings to be evacuated.It’s not a new phenomenon: there have been an average of 90 sinkholes a year in Rome since 2010. In 2013, there were 104 and 2018 will surely surpass even that record. The problem is clearly getting worse: the streets are beginning to look like black emmenthal and everyone in Italy is wondering why the earth seems, in the words of the Jewish prophet Isaiah, “to stagger like a drunken man”.Some blame the rain. Romans are used to wearing sunglasses all winter, but this has been the wettest six months in living memory. There have been plenty of what are melodramatically called bombe d’acqua, water bombs. In September last year, flooded subways were closed as rivers cascaded down the escalators and stations became huge shower rooms with water gushing through ceiling cracks. Thousands of cars were in water up to their wing mirrors.Rain is a problem because of the city’s geology. Much of Rome is built on unconsolidated (ie soft) sediments, like the floodplain of the river Tiber. That means that water washes away small deposits that give the ground additional rigidity. Soft soil also amplifies not just earthquake tremors (hence the missing south side of the Colosseum) but also the vibrations of the city’s incessant traffic, causing what the president of Lazio’s guild of geologists calls “the liquefaction of the ground”. It’s like shaking a sieve full of water and clay below the asphalt: soon enough, the water will whisk away the grit and you’ll be left with a jelly-like blob to support the heavy traffic.In many ways, the city council has exacerbated the problem: it is perennially corrupt and chronically incompetent. Last December, it was unable even to buy a green evergreen for Christmas. The tendering process for road repairs and reconstruction has been dragging on for years, because Roman bureaucracy is like treacle. And when a contract is finally awarded, companies often cut corners, patching roads badly because that way there will be more work in future. Meanwhile, the city council deals with 4,000 insurance claims a year, mainly regarding vehicle damage and broken bones due to falls.Romans deal with the setbacks with characteristic humour. They’ll laughingly tell you that Honda moved its suspension research centre to Rome because the city has the worst roads in the world. The brown-needled Christmas tree they nicknamed spelacchio (“the mangy thing”) and a cartoon last week suggested that at least the sinkholes might be able to halt the progress of Lionel Messi and his mates from the visiting Barcelona football team (as it was, Roma won anyway).But the sinkholes are a serious reminder that extreme weather and procedural incompetence can be a fatal combination. Last month, a former mayor of Genoa, Marta Vincenzi, was sentenced to five years in prison for failing to take the necessary safety measures during the 2011 floods in which four women and two children lost their lives. In January last year, 29 people died when intense snowfall coupled with earthquake tremors caused an avalanche that obliterated a hotel in Rigopiano, in Abruzzo. Warnings had been ignored and the rescue effort was so slow that one eventual victim appears to have survived for 40 hours under the snow.It may be unfair to blame emergency services or politicians for those fatalities. As one ironic Italian saying goes, parodying the habit of blaming of politicians for everything: “It’s raining: thieving government.” But what’s clear from Rome’s craters and torrential rains is that events that used to seem extraordinary are now normal. Last September, in Livorno, 256mm of rain fell in one night, more than in the previous eight months eight people lost their lives in the resulting floods. Thirty seven people died in floods in Messina in 2009 13 in Liguria two years later 18 in Sardinia in 2013.In a month in which Le Marche has again been subjected to repeated earthquakes, one gets the sense that the soil in Italy is simply less solid beneath one’s feet. It’s not only due to seismic activity (although earthquakes have claimed 669 victims in the past 10 years). It’s down to topography: steep and sodden mountains, like the Roman asphalt, occasionally give in to gravity, taking roads and houses with them.

And the fact that the timing seems to have been dictated at least in part by a prime minister running scared of a parliamentary vote is little short of scandalous.By refusing to engage parliament on the issue, Theresa May has shown a contempt for parliamentary democracy, and trampled over an important safeguard against unwanted military action.As a result, we’ve found ourselves rushing headfirst into striking a foreign nation alongside a trigger-happy US president when there is little evidence to suggest that our actions will make a positive difference, and much to suggest that they could make matters worse. To intervene militarily before Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspectors have even been able to investigate the site is also deeply concerning.The risks of escalation are real. Only on Friday the UN secretary general said “the cold war is back with a vengeance”. Russia has already threatened to attack the “source” of any missiles aimed at Syria – and I fear mission creep leading to any attempted “regime change” imposed by the west.Look at Libya, at the rise of Isis in Iraq, at the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan – the long-term impacts of our recent military interventions are a bloody stain on our country’s record. Syria is a tinderbox, the theatre for proxy wars by numerous different actors, and is already deepening the tensions between Israel and Iran. To drop bombs on Assad without a serious, thought-out strategy, and a plan about what happens next, risks making a horrific situation even worse. Even if early indications are that the regime, Russia and Iran will shrug this off in military terms, they will certainly milk it for propaganda and make the search for peace even harder. There is, of course, much that we can be doing. We should be cracking down on Russia through further sanctions and pursuing diplomatic channels. It’s worth noting that US sanctions against Russia are finally beginning to have an effect. New US sanctions on seven oligarchs, 17 top officials and 12 companies led to tens of billions of dollars in losses on Russian markets within just a few hours on Monday, and the rouble recently suffered its biggest daily fall in over three years. We now need to double down on these actions.And Britain urgently needs to get its own house in order if we want to be a positive influence on the world stage. That means ending arms sales to Saudi Arabia, standing up to the aggression of the Israeli government and playing our part as a nation of peace building.The attacks may have already started, but some semblance of democracy must now be restored. Theresa May must bring a debate and, crucially, a vote to parliament on Monday – and give MPs an unwhipped say on these strikes.

Decoded, that means attacks carefully targeted not only to minimise civilian casualties – which so often discredit action of this kind as reporters are guided to the sites of strikes by the dictator being attacked – but more particularly to avoid provoking Vladimir Putin into a “disproportionate response” (the sanitised diplomatic language of these situations).Time and time again Putin has shown his contempt not only for international law (witness Crimea and Salisbury) and chemical weapons conventions (witness Syria and Salisbury), but also western power and pretensions – witness his dismemberment of Ukraine.The west clearly has to contend with a massive Putin problem and threat – as well as unspeakable war crimes in Syria, where Putin is propping up Assad – and a humanitarian catastrophe that engages the west morally and directly, because of the ongoing refugee crisis that Syria is inflicting on its neighbours and Europe.The case that could be made for May is that we in Britain have recently been attacked by the Russians and are threatened by Putin at large. Trump and Emmanuel Macron supported us in expelling Putin diplomats after Salisbury. They were intent on these limited airstrikes in Syria, to appease domestic pressures, so we had to support them. But having decided to do so, May couldn’t risk a parliamentary debate, partly because her arguments are weak, but also because, with a hung parliament and Labour under Jeremy Corbyn so unwilling to play conventional politics, the vote might have been lost.The August 2013 Commons vote, when MPs rejected David Cameron’s motion to support bombing Syria in similar circumstances, will have weighed heavily with May and Tory whips. There were no constitutional or security reasons for parliament to have been sidelined this time. On the contrary, there were compelling constitutional arguments why MPs should have been consulted. The cabinet met with full publicity on Thursday to authorise the action. Parliament could have been summoned for Friday, entirely consistent with undertaking the bombing in the evening, had there been a majority for action.Had May made the basic “back Trump against Putin” case, and no other, in the Commons, I suspect she would have rallied Tory MPs and the DUP to avoid a defeat, on the assurance that this action was one-off.It is a vital British and European interest to demonstrate to Putin that Trump is on our side, not his. Our security and defence services are rightly concerned that Putin may not understand this and might thereby seriously miscalculate, perhaps by invading the vulnerable Baltic states in a widening of his Ukrainian enterprise and quest for nationalistic glory.The problem for May is that she can hardly say any of this in parliament. She has to make humanitarian and strategic arguments about the need for the Trump action in order to help Syria itself and eradicate chemical weapons. But these arguments do not exist.The bloodshed and conflict in Syria are not largely caused caused by chemical weapons, however abhorrent. Other weapons are destroying hundreds of thousands of people, and their communities, with impunity. Trump, Macron and May have made clear that they intend neither to intervene in Syria more widely, nor to engage in direct conflict with the Russians over chemical weapons. So this is not a prelude to a western strategy to topple Assad and seek an end to the civil war or chemical weapons.Is there a moral case for the action, even if it did little or nothing to help Syria? Hardly. We have moral duties to the dispossessed – and should be taking our fair share of Syrian refugees, particularly parentless children. We aren’t. And May did not propose to do so in her press conference. That is the really shameful non-action of our government. • Andrew Adonis is a Labour peer, former transport secretary and former chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42e24f5e995eadee98adeb7aa50ec0ce822df33/35_340_6426_3858/master/6426.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9ed8c154a9c82f3ac96e6ef49403e885 1240w","title":"farmers crops livestock turmoil beast from east climate change","story":"Last year, asparagus growers were harvesting as early as 8 April. This spring, they are not expecting to harvest their open-field crop until the last week of April – a week later than the official start of the season, St George’s Day, 23 April. Welcome to just one of the consequences of Britain’s disastrously delayed spring.“We have had a very challenging time,” said Guy Smith, vice president of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU). “March breezed in with the ‘beast from the east’ and went out with the worst bank holiday on record.” For asparagus-lovers there is at least an upside. “The combination has to be right for the crowns to push through,” explained Per Hogberg, of grower Wealmoor. “The air temperature has to be at least 12C, while the soil temperature should be between 8C and 10C. With warmer weather expected, consumers can expect a bumper crop in mid-May,” he said.It is not just asparagus growers praying for a warm, dry spell. The earlier farmers can sow, the more chance their crops have to achieve their potential. “My father was a farmer and one of his sayings was ‘a peck of dust in March was worth a king’s ransom’,” Smith said. “If the ground is nice and friable and makes a good seed-bed then it can be potentially quite lucrative for the farmer. Well, that’s gone this year.”Farmers griping about the weather goes with the job. But Smith fears something is happening to Britain’s weather that has consequences which stretch far beyond farming.“We farm in north-east Essex, in the driest spot in the British Isles, and so we’re keen observers of the British weather. More often now we seem to be stuck in long periods of wet months and then long periods of dry months, which is more challenging for farmers.”Adam Lockwood grows spring onions in the Vale of Evesham in Worcestershire. “At the minute we’re struggling to get going,” he said. “Potato growers haven’t even started planting yet and drilling dates are well behind where they should be.“We’re lucky in one sense that what we’re doing is all seed. I can buy seed and put it in a shed and it doesn’t matter, but lettuce and brassica growers who have plants raised in a nursery that were ready weeks ago, they’re now having to throw those away.”Like Smith, Lockwood thinks that the climate is changing. “We’re getting more rain in a shorter period rather than evenly distributed across the year – that’s what I’m noticing. And you’re getting more intense dry periods. It’s more extreme.”Livestock and dairy producers have been particularly hard hit. “It’s been a very late spring, even for a hill farm where we are,” said Richard Findlay, chair of the NFU’s livestock board, who farms in the North Yorkshire Moors National Park.“Instead of keeping the sheep in a couple of days after they’ve had lambs, we’re keeping them in for two or three weeks. We’re very fortunate in that we have the buildings to do it, but a lot of neighbours who don’t are struggling and have had many more losses.“We have nearly 1,000 sheep and it’s costing us about £1,000 extra a week at the moment to feed and house them to avoid a lot of losses. If we turned them out in poor weather there would be very little grass to eat.”What the farmers are experiencing first-hand accords with what scientists are finding. Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at NCAS-Climate, University of Reading, who helps run www.WeatherRescue.org – a site where volunteers digitise millions of historical weather observations – says that UK temperatures have risen by around 1.5 degrees in the last 150 years.“It’s basic physics: warmer air can hold more moisture so, as the atmosphere warms, it means, when it does rain heavily, we get more rain than we would otherwise have done from the same storm 100 years ago.”In the short term, farmers like Smith hope that the coming week’s warmer, drier conditions are going to stretch through April. In the longer term, he believes that the first three months of 2018 should sound alarm bells.“We need to remember that it’s reckless to take food production for granted,” he said.Growers say their crops will not be ready until the end of the month, almost three weeks late.Many growers have yet to plant.Seeds which should have been sown back in February yet to go in.Stocks have been kept indoors for weeks, meaning higher fodder prices and possible price rises for consumers.Plants due to go into the fields have had to be thrown away.Spring barley and spring wheat weeks behind sowing schedule."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff605ed71710076bfcf8462774ae19d17e4986b2/0_0_3226_1936/master/3226.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4b6af9c9a451b748cc8e16d41e7cd49 6000w","title":"how to wear pastels in pictures","story":"Whether you are adding pastel pieces to an outfit or going for full-on monochrome, invest in soft colours this season"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6753b9841d2465117985c28d7190c1fe1d9627ad/0_446_4193_3330/master/4193.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d51e77fa5ffc714badadb1d375892959 1240w","title":"johnny flynn film q and a beast kathryn bromwich","story":"The actor and singer on his love of gardening, why audiences need to feel uncomfortable, and his new film, BeastAs well as being a singer-songwriter with folk band the Sussex Wit, Johnny Flynn has had a number of acting roles in theatre, TV and film, including Clouds of Sils Maria. Michael Pearce’s film Beast, in cinemas from 27 April, is about the relationship between Moll (Jessie Buckley) and Pascal (Flynn), an outsider who is considered a suspect in a string of violent crimes.This is quite a hard film to describe without spoilers, so I’ll let you do it...I think a good way of framing it is as an adult fairytale, in which dark, subconscious forces in these repressed characters collide with the surface of the real world. This is what happens in a lot of traditional fairytales – they’re a way of understanding our darker nature. The name of the film is quite apt, because you don’t know who or what the beast is, and it asks that question once you start watching.Did you and Michael Pearce make a decision on whether your character was guilty or not?We played around with it: when we were filming we might emphasise it one way, then do another take where it was more ambiguous. You can watch the film and have a feeling about it one way, then reflect and actually think it was totally different. I’ve seen it once and it felt like a different film to the one I had in my head when we were doing it – in a really good way.How did you manage to find the right balance between charming and dangerous?The thing about Pascal is he believes in himself: he’s fought against the system all his life and has hit an equilibrium where he’s established a life for himself. I had a lot of sympathy for him – it’s important when you’re playing a character to believe in your own validity. I wanted him to have the same sense of release in meeting Moll that she has in meeting him. You have to believe they have something special and could potentially save each other somehow.What do you think attracts Jessie Buckley’s character to someone who is potentially dangerous?Michael grew up in Jersey and he showed us a side of it that has this small-island mentality – conservative, stuffy, suburban – and Moll is from that environment. Pascal represents a sense of freedom, and when we meet her she’s desperate to get out – even though it seems quite dangerous, it’s thrilling. He’s the only person who really sees her and treats her with respect, without her having to apologise all the time for something she did in her past.Can making audiences uncomfortable be a healthy thing?Definitely. I think we’re waking up, as a race, to uncomfortable truths about ourselves. We’ve been kind of rolling along in this bubble, needing soporific entertainment to ease us along, and suddenly we’ve woken up to all these things that have exploded in ourselves: realisations about the lack of equality between men and women, or the way we’ve dealt with difficult decisions in the last two years. We all have these shades in our nature: it’s a spectrum within all of us. So I think that’s a clever form of storytelling at the moment, where you’ve been lulled into a sense of agreeing with something, because we need to have those sides of ourselves questioned.If you’re playing quite a dark role, is it difficult getting out of character at the end of the day?I’ve just come back from doing Hangmen, a Martin McDonagh play in New York, and that character is definitely some sort of psychopath. Our job as actors is to invent the things that bridge ourselves with the characters, so you have to build something if it’s not there – you try and learn what makes people behave in a certain way. It’s interesting coming back to neutral and remembering who you are and what your moral standing point is in the world. But I find I miss characters as I leave them behind.Were you glad when your Channel 4 show Scrotal Recall was renamed Lovesick after moving to Netflix?I think I was the only one who was weirdly attached to the name. I like really bad puns – proper, red-top, nasty puns – I find them funny. But it did make it easier to tell the headmistress of my son’s nursery what I was doing. Netflix did all these polls in America, and even the people who liked the show wouldn’t tell anyone about it because they didn’t want to have to say the word “scrotal”.On Twitter you describe yourself as a musicianactorgardener. How’s your garden coming along?I was in New York until about two weeks ago, and I’ve come straight down to Wales with the family, so I haven’t really been to the garden in London this year. But I’d stolen a load of wild garlic from a walk somewhere, and I was really excited to see that’s starting to come up, as well as all these tulip and daffodil bulbs I’d put in the ground about two years ago. They were given to me by a cousin who died last year, so it’s lovely that they’ve come back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6a3e79385a0682f27c8e6dc245be40c2c2c0b3a/0_130_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f6634f86b7ba2b61522798997f6bc28a 1240w","title":"fulham brentford championship match report","story":"Cue the wild celebrations in the Birmingham hotel where the Wolves squad celebrated another team’s goal like never before. Deep into four added minutes at Craven Cottage, and just as Nuno Espírito Santo’s side presumably had resigned themselves to keeping the party on hold, the Brentford substitute Neal Maupay snatched an equaliser to break Fulham hearts and hand Wolves passage into the Premier League. Without even kicking a ball, they had done it.Once confirmation filtered through to the Midlands, Santo jigged, high-fiving Julio Figueroa before hugging his first-team coach, as the players erupted with joy. After leading the Championship since 18 November, Wolves could finally toast promotion, and a return to the top flight after six years away. The real party, however, will take place at Molineux , when Wolves entertain Birmingham, who are still battling relegation.As players and staff bounced, sang and embraced, Fulham were still coming to terms with a galling draw that seemed like a defeat, even if it extended their extraordinary unbeaten run to 21 matches. “I love @nealmaupay18,” tweeted the Wolves club captain, Danny Batth.More straightforwardly, the Wolves managing director, Laurie Dalrymple, said: “We are thrilled. This is a culmination of a huge amount of hard work from the players, coaching team, management team and the fans. Everyone’s hugely elated, we are keeping a reasonable lid on it because we have got a game tomorrow but we are not understating our excitement about what we have achieved.”With four games to play, Fulham still have hopes of joining them. They were heading back to second place after a wonderful finish by Aleksandar Mitrovic, but they did not have it all their own way against a slick Brentford. After soaring into the top two earlier this week, Fulham are staring back up at Cardiff City, who sit one point above them with a game in hand.It was always going to be a charged evening, with Brentford making the five-mile trip and Slavisa Jokanovic’s side acutely aware that anything but a home win would not only help Wolves, but also severely dent their own automatic promotion hopes. The manager can only hope the damage caused by the late leveller is not lasting.“Tomorrow we are going to be OK, we are going to rest and be ready for the next challenge,” Jokanovic said. “I am not a depressive man, I am very positive. I don’t have time for crying or complaints, I only have time to support my team to recover, and to push hard for the next game ahead of us.”If they were not already feeling the pressure when the news Cardiff had won at Carrow Road filtered through there were, predictably, groans. To make matters worse, Fulham made an unconvincing start, with Romaine Sawyers drilling wide and Ollie Watkins rounding Marcus Bettinelli only to be wrongly flagged offside, before Florian Jozefzoon forced the Fulham goalkeeper into another stop.Dean Smith, the Brentford manager, had pledged this would be a “mouth-watering” game given both teams’ expansive styles, and so it proved. It was enough to lure Hugh Grant too, with the actor in the crowd at Craven Cottage. By half-time, Bettinelli had palmed over from Yoann Barbet, who headed over moments after it.Smith then introduced Maupay off the bench but it was Mitrovic, anonymous until 20 minutes from time, who drew first blood. Stefan Johansen picked him out on the edge of the box and the on-loan striker wrapped his left boot around the ball to open the scoring. Maupay nodded home in injury time to ruin the mood and he wheeled away in front of the delirious Bees supporters. It was a goal that also kept their slim play-off hopes alive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72e028ea9991be760d513729b90603301d5eacd2/49_45_2951_1771/master/2951.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=50267cb0ccc4153be2defa537c331ec2 1240w","title":"liverpool bournemouth premier league match report","story":"The bad news for Harry Kane is that Mohamed Salah is not standing still waiting to be caught. The Liverpool forward became the first player to reach 30 league goals with a delightful second-half header, leaving him one goal short of the record for a 38-match season, with four games to play.In all competitions Salah has 40 for the season, enough to join the ranks of Liverpool royalty. Only Roger Hunt and Ian Rush have managed that feat before. One more league goal and Salah joins Alan Shearer, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suárez as joint top scorers for a 38-game Premier League season, although the chances are he will go out in front. He may even reach or pass the 34 goals Shearer scored in the original 42-fixture Premier League, though for the moment Liverpool are sufficiently impressed with the Rush connection.“Thirty-one years since Ian Rush scored 40?” Jürgen Klopp asked in mock disbelief. “He doesn’t look that old. Was he 14 years old at the time? Mo knows the way we play suits him. Perhaps the boys were searching for him a bit too much, but it is a win-win situation. He wants us to be successful and we would love him to get the Golden Boot.”Salah had already had a couple of chances by the time Liverpool took the lead on seven minutes. Jordan Henderson sent a diagonal cross into the box and though Asmir Begovic kept out Sadio Mané’s initial header from close to the penalty spot he could not keep hold of the ball, and the Senegal forward lost no time in tucking away the rebound.Though Jordon Ibe did try to hit back against his former club with a speculative drive that flew a couple of feet over Loris Karius’s crossbar, once Liverpool had taken such an early lead there was more interest in whether or not Salah would get on to the scoresheet than the outcome of the game.Apparently piqued by Kane’s nerve in bulking up his total with a disputed goal, Salah made it clear from the outset he was keen to find the target. He brought a save from Begovic midway through the first half when it might have been more rewarding to pass to a colleague than shoot, and when a stray Simon Francis pass gave him a chance to run at the Bournemouth defence a few moments later he again showed little inclination to part with the ball, even though he must have known he had a slim chance of scoring with a rising shot from the edge of the area.The second half began in a fashion that was actually quite tedious. The fact that Liverpool only had one attacking effort of note for a quarter of an hour might give some indication of how tedious. Roberto Firmino ran offside on a couple of occasions but that was about it for excitement. A 50-yard break by Trent Alexander-Arnold did bring Salah back into the game just after the hour mark, though by his standards the eventual shot was tame and straight at the goalkeeper.The danger with just one goal separating the teams was that Bournemouth might sneak back into the game and share the points with a single effective attack, yet at the mid-point of the second half a couple of Salah-related incidents brought the stadium to life.First he went flying in the penalty area claiming a push in the back from Nathan Aké. It was in some ways similar to the Juventus foul Michael Oliver did so well to spot in midweek, though Chris Kavanagh was having none of it and replays proved him right. Aké did raise his hands, unwisely, and Salah may have felt the contact, though there was not even a hint of a shove.Less than a minute later Salah had his revenge, drifting in behind Aké to get his head to Alexander-Anold’s cross and put Liverpool two in front. That barely does his 30th league goal of the season justice, for Salah still had to apply the right amount of power and precision to get the ball above and beyond a 6ft 5in goalkeeper. In effect he lobbed Begovic while facing away from goal, showing the sort of instinctive finishing that has become his trademark. He made a difficult chance look easy. No wonder Kane is worried.Karius had to make a stop from Dan Gosling after that but Liverpool were never seriously threatened. Firmino could have made it 3-0 a few minutes before he scored, though after missing one good chance through over-elaborating in front of the Kop he made sure he buried his next one.“Liverpool have really improved in the last year,” Eddie Howe said, when reminded his team took a point from Anfield last season. “They are tough to play against at the moment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61d78ef93bbc6be35ce700ac1218602deb16b2e1/87_0_2910_1746/master/2910.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6b19c29dc47a4da0c177292158e68ab9 1240w","title":"tottenham manchester city premier league match report","story":"If the true test of a team is how they cope in times of adversity, then Manchester City could hardly have chosen a more emphatic way to silence the people who seem to like nothing more than picking holes in Pep Guardiola’s methods. City had been forced to suck it up after a traumatic fortnight and it will be a long time before their fans get over missing out on the chance to start the title party in front of Manchester United last weekend. Yet if anyone wanted to know why Guardiola is on the verge of winning the Premier League for the first time, Wembley was the place to be on Saturday night.Forget about the envy City will feel when Liverpool take on Roma in the Champions League semi-finals. This is no time to focus on their flaws. Not after they answered all the criticism by ending Tottenham’s 14-game unbeaten run with a blend of class and defiance, proving beyond doubt that little is as intoxicating as witnessing a Guardiola team allowing the creative juices to flow.Guardiola could barely keep the smile off his face as he paid tribute to his players afterwards. City require only three points from their final five games, with Swansea the visitors at the Etihad Stadium next Sunday, and the race will be over if United lose at home to West Brom on Sunday or at Bournemouth on Wednesday. How does Guardiola plan to spend his Sunday? “I’m playing golf with my son,” he said.He will probably find a way to keep an eye on the United score, yet if City were carrying any psychological scars from their recent setbacks, they covered them up well. They relished Wembley’s wide open spaces, just as they had when collecting the first trophy of the Guardiola era with that impeccable victory over Arsenal in the League Cup final two months ago, and Tottenham must have feared they would be on the receiving end of a fearsome backlash as they tried to combat City’s high press and mastery of the ball.The willingness to take risks sets City apart and no player encapsulates that more than David Silva, who was everywhere in those early stages, demanding the ball and unnerving Tottenham with how easily he crept away from his markers. City’s forwards knew that they just had to make the right runs and they almost took the lead in the fourth minute, Silva releasing Raheem Sterling behind Ben Davies, Leroy Sané volleying the winger’s cross against the woodwork.Mauricio Pochettino started Érik Lamela instead of Son Heung-min, hoping the Argentinian’s ability to hound defenders would set the tone for Tottenham, but City were in the zone and the only surprise was that it took until the 22nd minute for the opening goal to arrive. They had taken note of Tottenham’s high line and pierced it with one long ball, Vincent Kompany lifting the ball through for Gabriel Jesus to tear away from Davinson Sánchez and fire a resounding finish underneath Hugo Lloris.Pochettino’s men were struggling to keep track of their runners and they found themselves in a deeper hole when Sterling skipped away from Sánchez and lured Lloris into tripping him. Replays suggested that the foul took place outside the area but Jon Moss pointed to the spot and Ilkay Gündogan made it 2-0. “The most important is to accept that sometimes it is for you and sometimes it is against you,” Pochettino said. “I am not going to complain. We lost because they were better.”City were in a similar position of strength against United last Saturday, though, and Tottenham struck back three minutes before the interval. Harry Kane released Christian Eriksen and the Dane enjoyed a moment of fortune when Aymeric Laporte’s desperate tackle rebounded off him and past Ederson.Tottenham were determined to find out if City would crumble at the start of the second half, swarming around David Silva and asserting themselves in midfield, where Mousa Dembélé was dictating the flow at last. It had become a frenetic contest, played in a terrific atmosphere, and Jesus spurned a glorious chance to settle City’s nerves, scuffing woefully wide after escaping Sánchez again.However, City began to weather the storm after Guardiola switched to a back five in the 64th minute, Nicolás Otamendi replacing Sané, and they grabbed the clincher eight minutes after that tactical shift.Sterling had added another baffling miss to his growing portfolio when he failed to punish an error from Lloris, infuriating Guardiola by firing against the prone Davies when it looked easier to score.Yet there was no chance of Sterling turning down the chance to score his 22nd goal of the season when a rebound fell to him moments later. The ball flew into the roof of the net and City can start planning the celebrations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/301ed980ad0db14324a3c812fbb99518bf108e1d/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ab0131379ecd901d20d77ab04d93322d 1240w","title":"blind date alice angus","story":"What were you hoping for?

Selfish in that a cake can be finely tuned to your exact preferences to create your perfect flavour, texture and appearance and generous in that, by their very nature, all cakes are best when shared (unless your name is Bruce Bogtrotter). Today’s recipe happens to be my perfect slice. It’s packed full of my favourite sweet ingredients: dates, dark chocolate, coffee and cardamom, built on a base of bananas for density, and topped with ganache and flowers just for fun.Pour the ganache over the cake while it’s on a wire rack for a clean look or, for a more natural style, put it on a plate and let the ganache run down the sides. Or skip the ganache entirely, and turn this into more of a morning or afternoon cake.Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Grease an 20cm springform cake tin with rapeseed oil, then line the base with baking paper.In a small bowl, soak the flax seeds in three tablespoons of water. Put the coffee in a jug, cover with 220ml just-boiled water, mix, strain (you should get about 200ml coffee) and stir in two tablespoons of sugar.Put the dates in a saucepan, cover with 250ml just-boiled water, then cook on medium heat, stirring often, until the water is absorbed and the dates disintegrate into a paste – eight to 10 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the bicarb (it will fizz). Add the bananas to the date mix, then stir in the flax seeds, oil, 50g sugar and 100ml coffee. Break one chocolate bar into pea-sized pieces and stir in.In a large bowl, whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, cocoa powder and ground cardamom, then fold in the date mixture. Tip into the cake tin and level out the top with the back of a spoon. Bake for 20 minutes, then turn down the heat to 150C300Fgas 2 and cook for 50 minutes more, until a skewer comes out clean, then leave to cool before turning out on to a rack or plate.For the ganache, break the second chocolate bar into pea-sized pieces and put in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water (take care the base doesn’t come into contact with the hot water) and stir until melted and glossy. Whisk in the remaining 100ml coffee, then pour over the cake.

Boos aside, the films were a critical success. But they symbolise a threat to a well-established business model for the industry. This year the festival’s organisers, who insist that films can only be entered for the competition if they are screened in French cinemas, have said Netflix can only show films out of competition at the festival, which takes place next month. Netflix will not do this because under French law, films cannot be streamed until three years after their cinema release in the country.The British actor Helen Mirren joined the fray on Thursday, claiming that the rise of streaming has been “devastating” for film-makers such as her husband, the US film director Taylor Hackford, who want their work to be “watched in a cinema with a group of people”. Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s head of content, highlighted the ision between “Netflix-film-makers” and the traditional industry when he said he feared that to show up at all in the south of France could mean “having our films and film-makers treated disrespectfully”.Netflix has never been overly keen to make its films available in cinemas. At best it likes a simultaneous release, such as acclaimed African civil war drama Beasts of No Nation, whereby some cinemas show the film while it is released to subscribers at the same time. Most US cinema chains refused to screen the film, which Netflix bought for $12m (£8.4m) but made less than $100,000 at the box office. Netflix’s streaming-first model threatens traditional film distribution that allows cinema chains to attract audiences because they have historically always enjoyed a significant exclusive period as the only place to catch a new release.Having disrupted the model for TV broadcasters by making schedules irrelevant and grabbing millions of viewers at the same time, Netflix is now making a run at Hollywood. It is directing a significant chunk of its $8bn budget at making 80 films this year. That is equivalent to the same number of releases the top five Hollywood studios will deliver in 2018. Netflix’s deep pockets have lured Hollywood stars such as Will Smith and Joel Edgerton, stars of the company’s recent $100m sci-fi film Bright, which is an indication of its intent.Nevertheless, the cinema industry is fighting back by investing heavily in making movie-going an experience that canot be replicated by staying at home on the couch. It is investing in leather reclining seats, VIP areas and high-quality sound and picture technology.“Our demise has been predicted for the last 80 years – with TV, VHS, DVD, Blu-ray, now with the internet – and we are not complacent,” said Tim Richards, the chief executive of Vue International, a top-three cinema chain. “Why do people go to restaurants, football games, live music – they want to get out of the house, they are social – and it is the same with film. Never under-estimate the demand for watching a movie on the big screen.”While the UK cinema industry seems in robust shape there are those that believe the global sector is living on borrowed time, on the brink of the kind of wholesale digital disruption that forever altered the music industry and revolutionised the way we watch TV.As a smaller cinema chain and distributor, Curzon already offers its films on its own video-on-demand service the same day as a release in one of its 20 UK cinemas. And Curzon has also done deals with Netflix to put its movies including Okja and Mudbound on the big screen. “We do want to continue to open cinemas and build footfall, but we don’t want to be big in the UK,” he said. “We are much more like the Apple stores, a means to an end rather than an end in themselves. I believe the future lies with Amazon and Netflix, that is where the funding is coming from for most of the content in the coming years, the tech platforms. The industry needs to stop seeing them as our enemy. I see them as my friends.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/914c7c5584d8253f5f3d644b3e867e6aac46d2be/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3a173590284604ff8395da188fb326c2 1240w","title":"dockless bike hire scheme ofo mobike santander cycles","story":"City dwellers will soon be unable to ignore the flood of dockless hire bikes hitting Britain’s streets, courtesy of two Chinese companies, Ofo and Mobike. Leeds is next in line, with Ofo placing 1,000 bikes in the city next month, Mobike is expanding around Manchester, while in London more and more boroughs are greeting the arrival of the yellow and red cycles.The concept is simple: you need a smartphone and a credit card. Download the app, load your credit card details, hire a bike for a low fee (usually 50p, but more of that later), then locate it on a map on your phone. Once at the bike, scan the QR code to unlock it and you’re off. At your destination find somewhere sensible to leave it, then lock it – that’s it.The reality, of course, is a little different – damaged and stolen cycles have littered canals, bins and back gardens, with residents complaining about clogged pathways and commuters angry about pile-ups at stations.The firms insist that after early setbacks, behaviour is improving and fewer bikes are being lost to vandalism. However, Mobike said last week that it is raising its fee from 50p to 69p for half an hour to encourage people to “treat the bikes respectfully” and park them better.So are they a cheap and cheerful alternative to cars, buses and taxis? Or an uncomfortable ride? We tested three services and found that Ofo easily beat Mobike for usability, while Santander Cycles is the only option, for now, for riders 1.83m (6ft) or above in height.Cost: 69p for every 30 minutes, 50p in London. Initial £1 deposit. Longer-term passes: £9.90 a month, £24.90 for 90 days, or £89.90 for a year.Ride: I’m 1.83m tall. The saddle, raised to its maximum, was still so low the bicycle was unrideable. There are no gears, so going uphill is heavy work. It felt unwieldy despite its modern design, with enclosed disc brakes and airless tyres. I asked some shorter colleagues to do a test ride Miles Brignall and Lisa O’Carroll found the seating position acceptable, but both declared the bikes too heavy.Sign-up: I downloaded the app over Google Play, with the contract and card details kept with Beijing Mobike Technology Co Ltd. The app required location access, which I agreed to, and offered a yesno for access to photos, media and to “make and manage phone calls”. I said “no” to these and the app still worked. It pre-selected a £9.90 monthly pass, but I was able to select the 50p-a-journey option instead. It was better than Ofo in warnings to leave the bike in a suitable place.Bike locating: Lots of available cycles immediately populated my phone screen, but the Guardian is in King’s Cross so that’s understandable. Unfortunately, it sent me to the wrong side of the canal for my first bike hire.Score: 510. Must do better. Its PRs are keen to point out that Mobike 3.0 is launching, with higher saddles for the European market. Once in place I’d consider using it, but until then it’s pointless for me.Cost: 50p for every 30 minutes, capped at £5 a day. No deposit. No passes either, but these are likely to be launched soon.Ride: Far better than Mobike. The saddle height was a little higher although still too low for me. It is more of a traditional-style bike, with three gears, so riding uphill is better. It felt lighter than the Mobike and although the bright yellow is ugly, it’s undoubtedly more visible to car drivers. Brignall and O’Carroll also found the ride lighter and easier.Sign-up: Again, I downloaded the app via Google Play – the contract is with Yellow Bike (Beijing) Data Services Co Ltd. It required access to contacts, location, photos and media, with no optout – you had to accept all these for the app to download. It has a simpler sign-up process, but less information than Mobike about pricing and scoring, where you are penalised if you leave the bike in a wrong geolocation, such as Camden – right next to Islington – which is yet to give Ofo permission for its bikes.Bike locating: Again, there are lots close to me although maybe a tad fewer than Mobike. I found the closest one easily.Score: 710. It needs to improve the frame and saddle height to make it acceptable to European customers. The PRs are keen to point out that they have begun replacing early models with ones that have a seating position that’s around 10cm higher. I tried one and they are much better, but will still be a challenge for anyone much taller than me.Cost: We tested Santander Cycles in London – rates in other cities vary. There is a £2 access fee for 24 hours, so long as no single journey exceeds 30 minutes. An annual unlimited-use pass is £90.Ride: Heavy but manageable. Saddles can be adjusted to suit nearly all heights. The cycles have three gears and the lights are better than Mobike and Ofo. The big design flaw is the front basket, which is little more than a bungee-style cord – a pain when you have some shopping. Mobike’s and Ofo’s are both simpler.Sign-up: You don’t need a smartphone or an app as you can sign up at the docking station with a debit or credit card. The on-screen process takes a few minutes to give a printout of a code that releases the bike. Annual-pass holders are sent a release key, which is quicker.Bike locating: A big drawback is that you must find a docking station (although Santander’s app can help) and hope bikes will be available. At your destination, it’s fingers crossed again that a dock will be free. Transport for London tries to redistribute bikes\u0026nbsparound the system, but not always successfully.Score: 810. These are good cycles and far more are available if you are just using them in central London, especially with a key-pass. But outside the city centre (north of King’s Cross or south of OvalKennington) there are almost no docking stations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86fac5ea88f259a244fdee781b62b7d7d2665318/562_81_3261_1956/master/3261.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a8270603c0eef6d61aa8d6aa63bf40fc 1240w","title":"lily allen send us your questions pop and rock","story":"Got something to ask the singer?

I did not excel in drug dealing – I was terrible at it. Golden rule with drug dealing – don’t get too enthusiastic with your own merchandise.”On being her own boss:“People in this day and age are still under the illusion that every woman who is successful must be being controlled by a man...

That’s what I try to apply to my music not to take selfies.”On standing up to trolls:“The goal for a lot of those trolls, bots and right-wing media arms is to shut down the voices of dissent. The way of doing that most effectively is to bully them... I don’t think cowering off into the corner is going to do anything. There aren’t that many people who are willing to do it, and for some reason I find myself here.”On good intentions:“I’m a nice person.

Sloan posted a picture of it to Reddit, where it went viral. Breaking the site’s protocol on self-promotion, she added a link to her Soundcloud page of song sketches in the comments underneath, a move that resulted in her signing a publishing deal, quitting Berklee College of Music (she studied music business) and moving to LA.After a few years struggling in writing sessions (“I was a bit of a jazz nerd, and I didn’t like pop music that much,” she’s said), she started to find her groove, co-writing Camila Cabello’s woozy ballad Never Be the Same.

The notices – requiring organisations to provide the ICO with specified information within a certain time period – were issued in the same week as the ICO conducted raids last month on Cambridge Analytica’s offices. The notices are both part of Operation Cederburg – the commissioner’s year-long investigation into the use of data in the EU referendum. Failure to comply is a criminal offence.Banks – who was by far the biggest funder of Brexit, providing £8.4m in donations and loans – confirmed on Friday that both he personally and Leave.EU had received “information notices”. In an email on Friday, Banks said they were “responding to it’” He said the ICO’s action was not an “investigation” but “an information request”.In a separate development, the Observer has obtained an invoice that Cambridge Analytica issued on 14 December 2015 for £41,500 for work it undertook on behalf of Ukip. The invoice says the payment is for “analysis of Ukip membership and survey data and creative product development”, and it is issued on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC, the American entity, from its office in Alexandria, Virginia. This is the first documentary evidence that Cambridge Analytica did conduct analytics work on behalf of one of the Leave campaigns in the period before the referendum.Banks confirmed to the Observer that he was also sent the invoice at that time too. He said he subsequently made a donation for the amount to cover the invoice to Ukip. A spokesman for Ukip, speaking to the Guardian last month, denied any payment for the work was made but he confirmed Banks had in fact made the donation after “new information had come to light”. He said that the party decided not to pass on the money to Cambridge Analytica.Banks has long denied that Cambridge Analytica did any work for Leave.EU, as has Cambridge Analytica. The question is still the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Electoral Commission. In a written submission to the select committee for the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) last month, Banks said he had met Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica but that he had declined to take him up on his proposal. Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it “did some preliminary analysis as part of a proposal to work with Ukip, but no contract was agreed, payment was not made to CA, and the preliminary work was not delivered to Ukip.”Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica director, who appeared on a panel at Leave.EU’s launch event, came forward to the Guardian last month and raised further questions about these claims. She said the company had completed around £40,000 worth of work for Ukip, using Ukip data, but agreed that the company had not been paid. She is expected to talk about this on Tuesday when she will testify to parliament as part of the DCMS committee into fake news.He also confirmed that the party had handed over its database of roughly 40,000 supporters to Cambridge Analytica despite denying this to the Guardian last month.Ukip had told the Guardian previously that Cambridge Analytica “saw” the data but a spokesman admitted the information – including telephone numbers, email addresses, ages, and other personal information among other things – was given to the company on a computer as part of what he described as “preparatory work”.The spokesman said: “I asked everyone about this work and I was told CA pitched for it, Banks didn’t like it and he’d refused to pay for it. It’s now come out that he did actually make a donation to cover the cost of the work. But we never actually handed it over.”The revelations raise a whole new set of questions about how the referendum was funded and whether strict rules on spending may have been broken. The Observer has seen evidence which suggests that a form of the Ukip data that Cambridge Analytica analysed and processed was passed to iniduals in the Leave.EU campaign. And a donation of £42,000 from Better for the Country, Leave.EU’s registered company name, was recorded as a political donation to the party on the Electoral Commission’s site one week before the referendum on 16 June 2016. It was not registered as part of the campaign by either entity as a referendum donation or expense.The unfolding of the Cambridge Analytica scandal has coincided with the final stages of the information commissioner’s investigation into the use of data in the referendum. Leave.EU’s operation has become one focus of the year-long investigation. Another resulted in the ICO’s raid on Cambridge Analytica. Damian Collins, the Tory MP for Folkestone, who is the chair of the DCMS committee, has told the Observer that both Britain’s electoral and data laws needed a radical and urgent overhaul. He said it was “ridiculous” that the ICO had to wait five days before being able to get a warrant to seize Cambridge Analytica’s computer servers and equipment.Separately, the ICO investigation is believed to be trying to understand the relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance Services, the Bristol-based insurance company that Banks owns and that was the HQ for Leave.EU referendum campaign work.

When asked about the use of Leave.EU’s database to send advertisements about his insurance products to campaign supporters, Banks said: “Why shouldn’t I? It’s my data.” When asked again last week, he said: “Leave.EU after the referendum campaign carried the occasional ad for insurance, so what?”In an email on Friday he said: “Eldon has never given or used any data to Leave.EU.

Her new book about social anxiety, How to Be Yourself, has been described by Susan Cain (bestselling author\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspQuiet) as “groundbreaking”.What is your definition of social anxiety? Social anxiety is often thought of as a fear of judgment or a fear of people, but that’s not accurate. Social anxiety is a perception that there is something embarrassing or deficient about us and that unless we work hard to conceal or hide it, it will be revealed and then we’ll be judged or rejected as a result.For instance, we might have the perception that we are boring, awkward or have nothing to say, or\u0026nbspany one of a million perceived flaws. We might avoid parties for these reasons, but we might also avoid them covertly by going to the party and only talking to the friend we arrived with, by scrolling through our smartphones or standing on the edge of groups.So the root of social anxiety is fear of this reveal, and it is grown and maintained by avoidance.Social anxiety disorder is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical\u0026nbspManual of Mental Disorders\u0026nbsp(DSM-5). When does it become a mental health issue? It’s the point at which social anxiety starts getting in the way of living a life or causes great distress. For example, a student who decides to forgo the class participation part of their grade because they don’t want to raise their hand, or an office worker who passes on a promotion because then they’d have to start doing presentations.Social anxiety, shyness, lack of confidence, impostor syndrome, introversion – there’s a lot of slippage and overlap between these terms… It’s a big Venn diagram. I think social anxiety and shyness are the same thing, but introversion is something different. I like to say that\u0026nbspintroversion is your way, whereas social anxiety gets in your way. So introversion and extroversion are personality traits,\u0026nbspthey are pretty much set, they are about where you get your energy – so introverts recharge and get their\u0026nbspenergy by being in blissful solitude, one on one with someone\u0026nbspthey trust or in small groups of people they know well.You write that there are some upsides to social anxiety, that it comes with some powerful skills… That’s absolutely true. I like to think of social anxiety as a package deal, it comes bundled with strengths like high standards and being empathetic. We’re often good listeners, we’re conscientious, we work very hard to get along with our fellow humans… it’s important to note that those traits don’t go away even as we work on our SA and our fear decreases. Those good\u0026nbsptraits are here to stay.You say “we” – can you talk a little about yourself and about why you were drawn to study this topic? This is the book I wish I’d had 20 years ago – these are the things I wish I’d known. I wish I’d known that how I felt wasn’t how I looked I wish I’d known that the things I was doing to try to make myself feel better, like avoid eye contact or be overly nice to people – that those self-preservation strategies – were just keeping me anxious because if bad things didn’t happen, those strategies got the credit. I wish I had known that the things I had avoided, they were not going to turn out as bad as I thought.You write about various examples of people who have overcome their anxiety by doing cognitive behavioural therapy exercises or learning new interpersonal skills. Why does that not seem obvious? We accept that training is required to learn, for example, a sport, but we seem to accept the psychology we’ve been dealt as fixed… I think perhaps we’ve been conditioned to think that our social anxiety is part of who we are. I’ve often spoken to people who have said something like, I wish I could just hit Pause on my life and the world, retreat and work on myself until I have some confidence, then press Play and rejoin life and be able to do the things I’ve wanted to do. I like to say, that’s fantastic, but let’s do it in the opposite order.Isn’t this common sense? Don’t we kind of know this, but still we don’t act? It’s because of our perceived consequences. If we’re trying to get fit, the worst that can happen is that we don’t make it very far or we feel out of breath: nothing dire will happen. But with social anxiety, taking those steps feels like a risk there is that perceived fatal flaw, the perception that there is something wrong with us, that we are annoying, boring and so on.That perception feels true and people will see it and reject us. The stakes are high, the consequences are higher. And that’s why we don’t take the risk: we would prefer to stay safe and lonely. It’s the devil we\u0026nbspknow.Why are our inner voices so critical, more critical than any other human we\u0026nbspmight meet in real life? Where does\u0026nbspit come from? Each of us – we are each our own worst critic. It is necessary that we each have this inner critic because a\u0026nbsphealthy dose of self-doubt helps us\u0026nbspmonitor ourselves and our behaviour. I like to say: “We doubt ourselves in order to check ourselves.” And ultimately, that means we get along better with our fellow humans. A total lack of insecurity is actually a sign that things have gone wrong, so the few people who have none can be classified as narcissists or psychopaths – and that’s not what we want.Although if you want to find a fierce\u0026nbspcritic these days, you could probably find one on Twitter… Social media is judgment in public.\u0026nbspYour likes and followers, you\u0026nbspcan count the number, everyone\u0026nbspcan see, it drives comparison. By now we know social media is the highlight reel, it’s\u0026nbspcurated. Yet it’s hard not to compare and feel inadequate.But presumably online communication can be a boon to people who find communication in real time stressful Email and posting comments does give us time to compose, edit and perfect, so that can allow someone an entrance into socialising – a lot of people feel better having a screen in front of them rather than a\u0026nbspperson. Which is fine, but talking in real time is really different: there is no time to compose and edit – so if we lose that experience, we assume it will go badly.Living in a “filter bubble” is reassuring… Anxiety is driven by uncertainty, and technology allows us to reduce uncertainty and control our world. We can stay immersed in worlds of\u0026nbspour own choosing but then there\u0026nbspis less time to spend navigating an uncertain world. So while we can use Google Maps when we get lost, or research menus before visiting restaurants, at the same time the world has gotten much more uncertain for big things. Careers have been replaced by the gig economy, or in romance the rise\u0026nbspof online dating means there’s an uncertainty in relationships – am\u0026nbspI really with the right person for me or is there a better match a swipe away? So we have less experience dealing with uncertainty\u0026nbspat a lower level but we are faced with a wider world which is much more uncertain. That’s not a\u0026nbspgreat combination.Isn’t a lot of online anxiety driven by\u0026nbspperfectionism? I’m thinking a lot about perfectionism. It could be a driver of social anxiety in that we have to perform perfectly, make the perfect comment, or we have to connect immediately, and when we don’t we think we’re awkward. Perfectionism is a misnomer: it’s not really about trying to achieve perfection, it’s about never being good enough – that sense of never really measuring up, of always being less-than, is a feature of so many areas of life.• How to Be Yourself: Quiet Your Inner Critic and Rise Above Social Anxiety by Ellen Hendriksen is published by St Martin’s PressPacifica Used by nearly 2 million people to help manage stress and anxiety.

It offers a three- to four-week part-residential programme where 15- to 17-year-olds work in teams building life skills, taking on challenges, making friends and contributing to their community.Almost £1bn of the budget for its current programme, which runs until 2020, has yet to be spent, prompting frenzied bidding for contracts among organisations that provide activity placements during school holidays.But the commissioning process has experienced problems. The NCS Trust, which oversees the service, recently dropped a claim to recover £780,000 against one provider, Engage4Life Ltd, which went into liquidation in December 2015.Last year the House of Commons public accounts committee concluded that the service “may no longer be justifiable” if it failed to meet its targets for increasing the number of participants, or achieve its longterm societal aims at a cheaper cost per head. According to the committee, the trust paid providers about £10m in 2016 for places that were not filled. As of last December just £200,000 had been recovered.The NCS, which was supposed to find 101,000 places for young people aged 16 to 17 in the last financial year, confirmed to the Observer that it had fallen short of this target.The organisation has also seen some senior members of staff leave.Natasha Kizzie, its director of marketing, left last month. Several others have joined a consultancy called Simpact CIC which advises clients on how to bid for contracts.An NCS spokeswoman said it was recommissioning its partner network to “help grow scale and impact in the years ahead”.She said: “The NCS recommissioning tender process will be fair, open and transparent for all interested parties. As with any public procurement we operate under strict regulations and take our responsibilities seriously. Everyone will receive the same information, and be asked to bid on that information alone. All suppliers will be asked to sign a conflict of interest form as part of the tender process.”NCS said that nearly 400,000 young people had benefited from its services, making it the fastest- growing youth programme in more than a century.It said an independent evaluation confirmed that for every £1 spent on its summer programme, NCS delivers between £1.15 and £2.42 of benefits back to society, while separate research found that it helped foster greater understanding and integration among 16- to 17-year-olds from different backgrounds.But Cat Smith, Labour’s shadow minister for voter engagement and youth affairs, said closer scrutiny of the service should be a government priority, given that youth services had seen their funding cut by more than £400m over the past six years.“The NCS provides great opportunities for young people, but we cannot allow this government to turn a blind eye to its failings.“The public need to know that every penny is spent effectively and that NCS providers pitching for new contracts this year will do so in a fair and transparent manner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cc4f9056fdafce8cd3d3307c399946d15c5cdf0/133_456_4189_2514/master/4189.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=799cb31fd8570787ee010ee3391cc19c 1240w","title":"leicester northampton premiership match report","story":"Northampton’s coaching consultant, Alan Gaffney, wondered before the match whether some of his players had switched off early: as early as last October, it could be argued, given their wretched form since then. But the sight of their oldest rivals, together with the incentive of only a second Premiership double over the Tigers, enlivened a side that started the afternoon with a mathematical chance of being relegated, spirit steering them to an unlikely victory.The last time Northampton faced Leicester, in September, they were also coming off the back of a heavy defeat by Saracens, but there was hope in their air then. A wretched season in which they have conceded more points and tries than any other club in the Premiership, and are fortunate to avoid more than a passing flirtation with relegation, now contains a sliver of silver after they pushed their neighbours out of the play-offs.There may have been a gulf between the teams in terms of league positions but there was far less of a gap on the field. Leicester dominated in terms of possession and territory but they led for only three minutes and committed a series of such egregious errors in attack and defence that they did not look worth their customary place in the top four, highlighting the general mediocrity of the Premiership.Their lineout creaked and they were twice penalised in the scrum after being shoved backwards. The second occasion was when Northampton’s replacement prop Alex Waller was in the sin-bin, and they blew a series of line-breaks through wasteful passing and poor support lines. Leicester conceded their first two tries after their flanker Valentino Mapapalangi positioned himself in no man’s land around the fringes, covering neither the ball-carrier nor a potential receiver.The match was held up for 10 minutes 13 seconds after it started. The Northampton captain, Rob Horne, got his head in the wrong position trying to tackle Graham Kitchener and was strapped on to a stretcher before being taken to an ambulance. Northampton took time to recover from the blow and should have been at least two tries down following Matt Toomua breaks that came to nothing, before striking with their first attack.The prop Paul Hill ran through a gap created by Mapapalangi’s poor positioning and eight phases later Ben Foden scored on the left.Northampton had last won in the Premiership here in 2007 and their only survivor from that day, Stephen Myler, kicked a penalty to put them 10 points ahead.Leicester stirred themselves to take the lead through tries by Telusa Veainu, who had earlier dropped the ball with the line beckoning, and Toomua after Kitchener had charged down Cobus Reinach’s clearance, but instead of taking charge the Tigers conceded a soft try from a lineout when Teimana Harrison tapped the ball back inside to Reinach, who waved goodbye to Mapapalangi. Three minutes after the restart Ahsee Tuala finished off a swaggering move to extend Saints’ lead to 12 points.The harder Leicester tried, the more mistakes they made, three George Ford penalties giving them the consolation of a bonus point. They lost five of their own lineouts, three in Northampton’s 22, failed to establish a dominance up front, were thwarted at the breakdown by Harrison and Jamie Gibson, penalised six times in attack, and when they did create space, Toomua squandered a two-man overlap by throwing a pass behind Luke Hamilton. Jonah Holmes did cross the line five minutes from the end but only after George Worth had cleared his path by blocking Piers Francis.Northampton, who had collapsed in the second half against Saracens the previous week, for once found strength in adversity and two Myler penalties kept them ahead. Their new director of rugby, Chris Boyd, will be at Franklin’s Gardens next week, formulating his plans for next season, and what this campaign has shown is that the gap in the Premiership is between the top two and the rest.Leicester dropped to fifth and their next match is at home to the team immediately above them, Newcastle, before they finish at Sale, who have top-six aspirations. The Tigers have lost four home league matches this season, their worst run since 2003-04, the last time they were doubled by Northampton.“The obstruction decision was brutal but what today showed was that if you do not control the ball and keep teams alive, it does not matter where they are in the league, they will beat you,” said their director of rugby, Matt O’Connor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/502bb724aa2e34e0fd7ee2b84360dc9f8a155a02/357_464_2508_1505/master/2508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4ba154755a5df0091fdfcf44324e34a7 1240w","title":"tiger roll holds on to win dramatic grand national photo finish davy russell horse racing","story":"• Davy Russell rides winner for trainer Gordon Elliott• Pleasant Company finishes second by a headThe owner of the horse that won the “People’s Race” here on Saturday is one of Europe’s most high-profile multi-millionaires, but Tiger Roll, who beat Pleasant Company by a fast-diminishing head, is a horse with whom the watching millions could identify. Like most of us, Tiger Roll has always had his good days and bad days – and when it mattered most he had the best day of all.Punters who take their betting seriously know all about the Timeform squiggle, the mark against a horse’s name in the ratings that suggests it is unreliable and cannot be trusted to give its all at the business end of a race. Tiger Roll has had a squiggle for years, despite a record that includes three victories at the Cheltenham Festival. Even Michael O’Leary, his owner, called him “a little rat of a thing” after the race.But Tiger Roll now has one of the most complete and impressive winning records of any jumper of recent years and O’Leary paid rich tributes not only to Tiger Roll and his rider, Davy Russell, but also Gordon Elliott, the trainer who somehow persuaded a Triumph Hurdle winner, over the minimum trip of two miles, to win the world’s most famous steeplechase over four-and-a-quarter.“If you look at the size of him, we never thought he’d make a chaser,” O’Leary said. “We kept him hurdling for two years and then there was nothing else to do, so we tried him over fences. He wasn’t a particularly brilliant novice chaser, either. But the phenomenal training performance here is that this horse has the speed to win a Triumph Hurdle and only four years later he’s winning four-mile races at Cheltenham and Aintree on soft and tacky ground. It is a brilliant training performance.”With the exception of a minor mistake at the first, Tiger Roll was foot-perfect throughout and one of the few runners able to keep Pleasant Company within striking distance as Willie Mullins’s runner produced an exceptional round of jumps.For much of the second circuit it seemed likely that it would be enough to get Pleasant Company home in front as he gained ground on his pursuers at every fence. But as he turned towards the stands on the final circuit with two to jump, Tiger Roll was suddenly at his flank and travelling like a winner.This was the point at which the old Tiger Roll, the one who earned a squiggle, might have decided that enough was enough. There was not a hint of reluctance, though, as Russell cruised into the lead and jumped the last with a commanding advantage.The only scare came with the winning post in sight as David Mullins summoned a strong final effort from Pleasant Company and rapidly and suddenly the gap started to close. But Tiger Roll had done enough and when Pleasant Company hit the front he was two strides too late.Bless The Wings, a 13-year-old stable companion of the winner, was another 11 lengths behind in third, while Anibale Fly was an honourable fourth for Barry Geraghty. Bryony Frost, the focus of much attention before her first ride in the race, was fifth aboard Milansbar, while there were 12 finishers from 38 starters. Saint Are, who was brought down at the Chair, was taken to the racecourse stables for assessment and later reported to be in a stable condition. There were no further reports of injuries to horses or riders .Elliott and O’Leary were enjoying their second victories in the National, following Elliott’s success with Silver Birch in 2007 – the first winner of his training career – and O’Leary’s win with Rule The World two years ago. Russell, one of the weighing room’s veterans, was winning for the first time, at the 14th attempt.“We were celebrating at the Elbow, and panicking at the line,” O’Leary said. “It was pretty close there at the finish. Tiger Roll is extraordinary. I did not think he would handle those fences because he is so small.O’Leary was referring to the 1-2‑3-4 for Irish-trained horses here, following a Cheltenham Festival last month that was, once again, dominated by Elliott and Mullins. Elliott was the leading trainer at jumping’s biggest meeting for the second year running and is in pole position to finally beat Mullins and claim Ireland’s title for the first time.“I’ve said before that I didn’t appreciate it the first time,” Elliott said, “but I’ll definitely appreciate it now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e7ca35979e3aa78a1078364da6baac8808114a0/0_31_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=96b6a799fe0ea998ad67b4e72c61ba35 1240w","title":"davy russell bounces back michael o leary sacking to win grand national","story":"Resilience is needed for any Grand National victory and Davy Russell finally got his reward here for proving perhaps the only employee Michael O’Leary could not get rid of. Just over four years ago, O’Leary called time on their relationship as owner and principal jockey but Russell rode his way back into the Ryanair man’s good books, leading to this shared moment of glory in the biggest jumps race of them all.Russell seemed at a low ebb in December 2013, when O’Leary fired him over the most famous cup of tea in the history of Irish jumps racing. He was in his mid-30s, at an age when many a fine rider has decided to do something less dangerous, and O’Leary was not the only one who felt the jockey should have been more effective on the track.But, when asked at the time what he would do next, Russell made it clear that stopping was not in his thoughts. “The same as I do every other day, try and take over the world,” he said.“He’s in a group of elite Irish jockeys, there’s Ruby Walsh, Barry Geraghty, Paul Carberry was one of them before he retired. Barry and Ruby have always been champion jockeys, winning all the best races. Davy’s career has been up and down, characterised by periods of great talent and achievement but also fallow periods. And it’s the way he keeps coming back and back again.”Russell’s craggy features might make him look dour, and the public perception of him is probably as one of the hard men of the weighing room. But he has used his moments of greatest triumph, here and after winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Lord Windermere, to acknowledge those he has lost, performing an idiosyncratic wave to the heavens that he copied from a film called 8 Seconds.Years ago, he acknowledged an unnamed friend he lost as a child. After a success at last month’s Cheltenham Festival, he paid tribute to his mother, who had died days before. He dedicated this win to his friend Pat Smullen, a Derby-winning Flat jockey who was diagnosed with a tumour last month.“I was speaking to him the other morning and he’s as tough as nails,” Russell said. Clutching the trophy, he added: “What would I give to be sharing this with my mother?”Had he been beaten, he would have blamed the decision to “wake up” Tiger Roll on the run to the final fence, mindful of the horse’s reputation as “a bit of a monkey”.“He had fallen a little bit asleep on me going to the second-last and I’d saved a lot throughout the race. I needed to wake him up and he came alight with me and winged the last. There was a long way to go and, to be fair to the horse, he was brave.”That decision to press on cost Tiger Roll precious energy and he tired so badly in the last 100 yards that he was almost collared. “That’s the choice I made,” Russell reflected. “Obviously it wasn’t the best choice to make but there was a reason behind doing it.“If I’d finished second, I’d be a long ways out of the racecourse by this stage, disappointed with myself. But I didn’t and I’m here and everybody wants to talk to me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ab55a2eec0455c6b522582b220a89d0f4c899d/87_41_2846_1992/master/2846.jpg?w=2750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36d7d8afb73d7606b8fc3401692e1522 5500w","title":"the unseen red rum in pictures","story":"After Red Rum’s second Grand National victory in 1974, Jeremy Hoare was invited by trainer Ginger McCain to meet and photograph the legendary racehorse at his Southport Yard.

Won the Munster National easily and then scrambled home in the Ladbrokes Trophy, when held up for a late challenge. Now 9lb higher but likely to have more to offer and wasn’t out of it when hitting the deck at Cheltenham. A clear round will surely put him in contention.Travelled well and was still going on at the finish when third in the Gold Cup, suggesting he might cope with this distance. Beat 27 rivals by daylight in a hotly contested handicap chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. Still on a beatable rating but this is asking a lot, with a big weight to carry. Doesn’t always get that high at his fences and took a heavy fall in the Irish Gold Cup. Also took a liberty at Cheltenham’s third-last and there is likely to be at least one scare along the way.Three times a winner at the Cheltenham Festival, including in the Cross-Country last month. Has also won a Munster National, so neither big fields nor marathon distances are a problem. He’s not wonderfully consistent and was well beaten on the two previous occasions when he ran a month after Festival success. Also, he’s not the biggest and could meet trouble when the field bunches up at the Becher’s – Canal Turn section of the course. But he undoubtedly has the talent to win and it would be no surprise if he did so with authority.“My 88 year old Dad has chosen Chase The Spud,” says Helen. “He was called Spud at school – his name went from Taylor to tater to potato to spud! I thought I had heard every one of his stories, but this was new one to me.” Lovely stuff."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

As guest host, Paxman isn’t the first man to talk down to a female panellist on the show – this time, delivering supercilious praise when McGovern answered a question correctly – and, as long as it lumbers on, he won’t be the last.Now into its 55th series, HIGNFY squats in the schedules like a smug toad, resolute in its if-it-ain’t-broke-don’t-fix-it folly. A festival of schoolboy sniggering, watching it is much like crashing a college reunion that’s gearing up for a rose-tinted game of soggy biscuit. One wonders if Will Self, in describing the show as “the very cockpit of British satire”, wasn’t being so flattering after all. While there are odd glimpses of the old humour, the mood is frequently toxic, with captains Ian Hislop and Paul Merton piling in on guests and then scratching their heads when producers struggle to find fresh ones.The most recent upset came when Hislop and Merton were quizzed in the Radio Times about the absence of female guest hosts, specifically women MPs, to which they replied, “Everyone you think should have been asked has been.” The real problem, they decided, is that women are too modest to come on their show. You what, lads? If modesty is how you interpret a woman weighing up her options and deciding she’d rather feast on fire ants in the Australian jungle than endure your special brand of humiliation then perhaps that says more about you than them?Editors could construct a sports-style montage out of the times that Hislop, Merton and male guests have talked over, patronised and bullied female panellists. For some choice lowlights, let me point you to the time Jimmy Carr jeered at Ann Widdecombe, “Ooh, take off your glasses, you’re beautiful”, or when Hislop and Merton interrogated Paula Yates about her breasts and choice of boyfriend. Their modest women theory is particularly precious when you consider the debate surrounding the gender pay gap and the claim made by an economist on a recent Today programme that men are paid more because of “choices freely made”. Apparently structural barriers are a figment of the female imagination, a consequence of all those hormones pulsing through our systems and paralysing our ability to see our own lack of ambition.But back to HIGNFY and the search for the lesser-spotted female MP, which is now, by all accounts, rivalling the hunt for the yeti. Tip-off, chaps: Anna Soubry has said she’s game. But even the presence of more women – more, at least, than one per episode – won’t save this sinking vessel. Last week, Merton, who has napped through the show for at least a decade, did little more than the odd cartoon double take, and left Hislop’s pompous proclamations unpunctured. Meanwhile, Paxman bellowed pointlessly and Josh Widdicombe barely uttered a word. Rarely has a show appeared more tired, more flabby, more blunted by its own complacency. The time has come to put it out of its misery. To go quietly would surely be the modest thing to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a2cfe2781bc849e8ffc8bfb827d05f569c11a91/0_188_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=5000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=253999986c180b5bbedafbfc2eb6d8fd 10000w","title":"eternal sunshine las vegas perfect winter holiday","story":"From stargazing in the desert to world-famous pool parties, Las Vegas offers something for everyone looking to escape the cold and the rainWhen it’s cold, wet and generally miserable in the UK, why not head to Las Vegas for the flip side: sun, swimming pools and outdoor adventures.

Orbán won a third term in power after his anti-immigration campaign message secured a strong majority for his ruling Fidesz party in parliament, granting him two-thirds of seats based on preliminary results. In a Facebook post before the rally, organisers called for a recount of ballots, free media, a new election law, as well as more efficient cooperation among opposition parties instead of the bickering seen in the run-up to the vote. In a Facebook post, the rally’s organisers said: “Fidesz’s election system and the government’s hate campaign have pushed the majority into a one-third (parliamentary) minority.” Protesters gathering outside the Opera House, a 19th century neo-Renaissance palace on a majestic downtown avenue, were waving Hungary’s and the European Union’s flags, with whistles and horns blaring. The demonstrators marched towards the parliament, chanting: “We are the majority.” In contrast to Orbán’s closing rally in his native Székesfehérvár last week, where the overwhelming majority of supporters were middle-aged and elderly people, the Budapest protest attracted many from younger generations. “We are disappointed and I think lots of us are disappointed with the election results, which, I think, were not clean,” said 26-year-old Palma, who declined to give her surname. Palma, who came to the protest with a friend, said she believed the Hungarian election system gave an unfair advantage to Orbán’s ruling Fidesz party. However, she was also displeased with opposition parties. “They are pathetic,” she said. “It is terrible that they are so weak, unable to reach a compromise and they kill each other instead of joining forces for us.” Nationalist Jobbik and the Socialists, which have the biggest opposition groups in parliament, had said they would join the protest, which was to march to parliament near the Danube river.The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said the election did not offer opposition parties a level playing field amid a host of problems marring a vote that on the whole respected fundamental rights.Orbán, who has transformed himself from a liberal anti-communist hero into a nationalist icon admired by the far right across Europe, brushed aside the criticism, telling the OSCE, “thanks for the contribution.” A major opposition newspaper has closed since the election, marking another milestone in the gradual decline of media pluralism in Hungary. The right-wing prime minister projected himself as a saviour of Hungary’s Christian culture against Muslim migration into Europe, an image which resonated with millions of voters, especially in rural areas. But the opposition’s poor showing was at least partly of its own making as rival candidates split the anti-government vote in five districts in Budapest, where preliminary results showed a slim Fidesz victory. “Zero, zero, zero,” 29-year-old Dia Szenasi said about the opposition, adding that all leftist parties should have joined forces to have a better chance of ousting Orbán.

File photograph: Susana VeraReuters Myanmar on Saturday repatriated what it said was the first Rohingya family from nearly 700,000 refugees who had fled to Bangladesh, after months of fraught talks with Dhaka and amid United Nations warnings that the country is not ready for their return.Fleeing Rohingya refugees have reported killings, rape and arson on a large scale. The United States and UN have described the Myanmar military operation as ethnic cleansing.Myanmar has denied nearly all allegations, saying it waged a legitimate counter-insurgency operation. The army has said its crackdown was provoked by the attacks of Rohingya militants on more than two dozen police posts and an army base last August.Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in January to complete a voluntary repatriation of the refugees in two years. Myanmar set up two reception centres and what it says is a temporary camp near the border in Rakhine to receive the first arrivals.“Five members of a Muslim family...came to the Taungpyoletwea reception centre in Rakhine state this morning,” the Myanmar government said in a statement late on Saturday.The family members were scrutinised by immigration and health ministry officials, and the social welfare, relief and resettlement ministry provided them with “materials such as rice, mosquito netting, blankets, T-shirt, longyis (Burmese sarong) and kitchen utensils”, said the government in the statement.It added that family members who “are in line with the rules” were issued with national verification cards (NVCs) upon entering Myanmar.NVCs are part of the government’s ongoing effort to register Rohingya which falls short of offering them citizenship. The card has been widely rejected by Rohingya community leaders, who say they treat life-long residents like new immigrants.Most Burmese consider the Rohingya as unwanted immigrants from Bangladesh, and the army refers to them as “Bengalis”.Last week, the most senior UN official to visit Myanmar this year, assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs Ursula Mueller, said the conditions in Myanmar were not conducive to the return of the refugees.She cited a continued lack of access to health services, concerns among the Rohingya about protection, and continued displacements. She described conditions in camps for internally displaced people from previous bouts of violence as “deplorable”.Several boats with Rohingya people from parts of violence-torn Rakhine state have left Myanmar in recent months.

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition. In a malnourished population the disease severity and duration of an infectious disease can be much greater.”Researchers are now conducting a follow-up study to assess whether the nutritional situation has changed.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Syrian strikes help Emmanuel Macron cement position as key Trump ally ahead of Washington visitStop sharing NHS data with Home Office, officials told Europe to see first genetically engineered patients using gene-splicing therapyLabour\u0026#39s \u0026#39unaffordable electoral bungs\u0026#39 could drive businesses out of Britain May announces £60 million fund to tackle scourge of  plastic in world\u0026#39s oceansLabour councillors standing for election pledge to help \u0026#39stop Brexit\u0026#39Donald Trump declared the US \u0026#39locked and loaded\u0026#39 for more strikes on SyriaJudi Dench told by Cornish villagers to stop interfering in phone mast disputeFrench ski guides plead guilty to causing British banker\u0026#39s deathBoom in cocaine demand fuels increase in strength putting more lives at riskRules for modern romance for the over 50s – you can kiss on a first dateProtect our salmon from poachers, volunteers demand as they say river deserves funding as it beats 58 others for yields Orphaned fox cubs advertised for £120 each on Facebook as charities warn of wild animals being sold onlineBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent auditions: partial nudity, nerve-jangling jeopardy and an emotional Ant and Dec - reviewSyria airstrikes: US warns it is \u0026#39locked and loaded\u0026#39 if Assad uses chemical weapons again - latest newsComment: How the Republicans fell out of love with big business – and especially Silicon ValleyPrivate schools\u0026#39 \u0026#39corporate greed\u0026#39 is pricing out middle-class families, former St Pauls\u0026#39 headmaster says Agatha Christie\u0026#39s Ordeal by Innocence adapted for first time after her great-grandson gave his blessingHow I woke to missiles streaking over the Damascus night sky How the strikes against Syria unfolded, with phone calls from Chequers and a sky full of missilesWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"sir tim laurence shaking english heritage hardest part marrying","story":"Princess Anne and Sir Tim Lawrence marrying at Crathie Parish Church in 1992Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, husband of Princess Anne and son-in-law of the Queen, has driven alone in his Land Rover Discovery from Gatcombe Park, his Gloucestershire home, to the Shropshire town of Ironbridge.

The policy would cost £1.4 billion a year – a sum Labour said would be funded from vehicle excise duty revenues currently allocated to road building.Mr Grayling writes: “By axing the National Roads Fund and spending the money on bus passes, it means cancelling dozens of projects that are designed to get Britain moving, and crucially to attract investment and jobs for that generation of under-25s.“So no more dualling of the A303 to the South West. No more dualling of the A1 in the North East. No new river crossing on the Thames to ease the jams at Dartford. And dozens more.”Announcing the pledge at a school in Derby, Mr Corbyn criticised “Tory austerity” and said: “Labour wants to help young people make the most out of life by investing in them”. But Mr Grayling says: “If you stop investing in a modern road system to give an unaffordable electoral bung to new voters, the investors who could create great jobs for them will do so in another country instead.”Syrian strikes help Emmanuel Macron cement position as key Trump ally ahead of Washington visitStop sharing NHS data with Home Office, officials told Europe to see first genetically engineered patients using gene-splicing therapyMay announces £60 million fund to tackle scourge of  plastic in world\u0026#39s oceansLabour councillors standing for election pledge to help \u0026#39stop Brexit\u0026#39Donald Trump declared the US \u0026#39locked and loaded\u0026#39 for more strikes on SyriaJudi Dench told by Cornish villagers to stop interfering in phone mast disputeFrench ski guides plead guilty to causing British banker\u0026#39s deathBoom in cocaine demand fuels increase in strength putting more lives at riskRules for modern romance for the over 50s – you can kiss on a first dateProtect our salmon from poachers, volunteers demand as they say river deserves funding as it beats 58 others for yields Orphaned fox cubs advertised for £120 each on Facebook as charities warn of wild animals being sold onlineBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent auditions: partial nudity, nerve-jangling jeopardy and an emotional Ant and Dec - reviewSyria airstrikes: US warns it is \u0026#39locked and loaded\u0026#39 if Assad uses chemical weapons again - latest newsComment: How the Republicans fell out of love with big business – and especially Silicon ValleyPrivate schools\u0026#39 \u0026#39corporate greed\u0026#39 is pricing out middle-class families, former St Pauls\u0026#39 headmaster says Agatha Christie\u0026#39s Ordeal by Innocence adapted for first time after her great-grandson gave his blessingHow I woke to missiles streaking over the Damascus night sky How the strikes against Syria unfolded, with phone calls from Chequers and a sky full of missiles\u0026#39An unequivocal message\u0026#39: How the world reacted to the Syrian airstrikesWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/10/TELEMMGLPICT000160011017_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqhNkvlguSCLNAbLFJA3hmlwHneqVwUKuplIkcPv5znvw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"republicans fell love big business especially silicon valley","story":"Mark Zuckerberg testified on Capitol Hill last weekThe US business world has been relentlessly politicised, and conservatives are pushing back Such is the state of Mark Zuckerberg’s life that the ignominy of spending 10 hours sitting on a big-boy cushion was not the worst part of his week.

I clearly declare that the president of the United States, the president of France and the British prime minister are criminals,\u0026quot Khamenei said in a speech, according to his Twitter account.\u0026quotThey will not benefit (from the attack) as they went to Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan in the past years and committed such crimes and did not gain any benefits,\u0026quot Khamenei said.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei poses for a portraitIran - the dominant Shi’ite Muslim power which is in rivalry with Saudi Arabia and the United States’ other Sunni Arab friends - has fought decades of sectarian proxy wars in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.Iran\u0027s pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani also warned that the U.S.-led missile attack on Syria would lead to further destruction in the Middle East, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.\u0026quotSuch attacks will have no result but more destruction ... the Americans want to justify their presence in the region by such attacks,\u0026quot Rouhani was quoted as saying by Tasnim.Rouhani signalled that Iran\u0027s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would grow.\u0026quotThe Syrian nation will continue to resist against foreign aggression ...Iran has always helped and will continue to support oppressed nations in the region and around the globe,\u0026quot Rouhani said.Iranian Defence Minister Hossein Dehghan said: \u0026quotThe Syrian people will certainly answer these attacks and the people of the world should condemn this aggression,\u0026quot Fars news agency reported.An official in Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the Islamic Republic\u0027s most powerful arm, said the fallout from the attacks will be at Washington\u0027s expense.Britain, the US and France on Friday night bombed Syria. Pictured is an RAF Tornado GR4 landing at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, which could be deployed against the Syrian government\u0026quotWith this attack ... the situation will become more complex, and this will surely be at the expense of the United States, which will be responsible for the aftermath of upcoming regional events that will certainly not be in their interest,\u0026quot Yadollah Javani, the Guards\u0027 deputy head for political affairs, told Fars news agency.\u0026quotThe resistance front will be strengthened and it will have more capacity to act against (U.S.) acts of intervention. Americans should expect the consequences of their actions,\u0026quot Javani said.Iran often refers to regional countries and forces opposed to Israel and the United States as a \u0026quotresistance front\u0026quot.\u0026quotUndoubtedly, the United States and its allies, which took military action against Syria despite the absence of any proven evidence ... will assume responsibility for the regional and trans-regional consequences of this adventurism,\u0026quot Iran\u0027s Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by state media.\u0026quotIran is opposed to the use of chemical weapons on the basis of religious, legal and ethical standards, while at the same time it ... strongly condemns (using this) as an excuse to commit aggression against a sovereign state,\u0026quot it said.Iran has been Assad\u0027s most supportive ally against insurgents throughout the conflict. Iran-backed militias helped his army stem rebel advances and, following Russia’s entry into the war in 2015, turn the tide decisively in Assad’s favour.Analyst Hossein Sheikholeslam, a former Iranian ambassador to Damascus, told state television the attacks would help unite Syrians behind the government.\u0026quotThese attacks will stabilise the Syrian government... and unite the different tribes in Syria as Syrians become aware of their honour and come to the defence of the independence, territorial integrity and the government of their country,\u0026quot Sheikholeslam said.Israel said in response to the American-led strike in Syria that the Middle Eastern country\u0027s \u0026quotmurderous actions\u0026quot had put it in danger.An official said in a statement that Mr Trump made clear last year that the use of chemical weapons was a red line not to be crossed.Damascus sky lights up with service to air missile fire as the U.S. launches an attack on Syria targeting different parts of the Syrian capital Damascus, Syria, early Saturday, April 14, 2018He said the overnight operation carried out by the United States, France and Britain followed that example. The official said that \u0026quotSyria continues to carry out murderous actions and be a base for these actions and others, including Iran\u0027s, that put its territory, forces and leadership in peril.\u0026quotThe official spoke anonymously according to protocol. There has been no other official Israeli response yet.Israel has issued several stern warnings of late about Iran\u0027s increased involvement along its border in Syria in Lebanon.Air strikes carried out by the United States, France and Britain against Syrian military targets could give terrorism an opportunity to expand in the region, the Iraqi foreign ministry said on Saturday.The air strikes marked a \u0026quota very dangerous development\u0026quot, the ministry said in statement.\u0026quotSuch action could have dangerous consequences, threatening the security and stability of the region and giving terrorism another opportunity to expand after it was ousted from Iraq and forced into Syria to retreat to a large extent,\u0026quot it said.The ministry called on Arab leaders to discuss the situation at a summit due to be held in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.Saudi Arabia has expressed its full support for US-led strikes on Syrian government military installations, saying they were a response to \u0026quotregime crimes\u0026quot against civilians.\u0026quotSaudi Arabia fully supports the strikes launched by the United States, France and Britain against Syria because they represent a response to the regime\u0027s crimes,\u0026quot a foreign ministry statement said.Saudi Arabia\u0026#39s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud meets with U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump during a reception ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 20, 2017The statement, carried by the official Saudi Press Agency, said the strikes were prompted by the \u0026quotSyrian regime\u0027s use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians, including women and children\u0026quot.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have been key backers of Syrian opposition groups fighting Assad.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has welcomed Western strikes against Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime as \u0026quotappropriate\u0026quot in retaliation for Damascus\u0027 \u0026quotinhumane\u0026quot attacks.\u0026quotWe consider this operation as appropriate,\u0026quot Erdogan told a meeting of his ruling party in Istanbul.\u0026quotThe regime has seen that its mounting attacks in recent days against dissidents ... will not be left unanswered.\u0026quotChina said it was \u0026quotopposed to the use of force\u0026quot following US-led air strikes against Syria and called for a \u0026quotreturn to the framework of international law\u0026quot.\u0026quotWe consistently oppose the use of force in international relations, and advocate respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries,\u0026quot foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement on its website.Hua said unilateral military action bypassing the UN Security Council would \u0026quotadd new complicating factors to the resolution of the Syrian issue\u0026quot.Xi Jinping and Donald Trump\u0026quotChina believes that a political solution is the only realistic way out for the Syrian issue,\u0026quot she added.\u0026quotChina urges all the relevant parties to return to the framework of international law and to resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation.\u0026quotChina is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.Beijing has consistently said the Syrian crisis needs a \u0026quotpolitical solution\u0026quot but has numerous times vetoed Security Council measures aimed at addressing the conflict - including an investigation of war crimes in the country.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday the air strikes against the Syrian regime were \u0026quotnecessary and appropriate\u0026quot after the suspected chemical weapons attacks that killed dozens in Douma.\u0026quotWe support the fact that our US, British and French allies ... assumed their responsibilities. The military intervention was necessary and appropriate,\u0026quot Merkel said in a statement.\u0026quotEverything leads us to believe that (Assad) bears responsibility\u0026quot for the Douma attack, Merkel said.The chancellor on Thursday had ruled out Germany joining any military action against Syria.On Saturday she said it appeared likely that the Syrian regime \u0026quothad used chemical weapons against its own people on several occasions in the past\u0026quot.Merkel added: \u0026quotA century after the end of World War I... we must fight against the erosion of the (international) convention on chemical weapons\u0026quot.\u0026quotGermany will undertake, in a determined way, diplomatic efforts to support this,\u0026quot Merkel said.The head of Nato expressed his support for Western strikes in Syria.Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement: \u0026quotI support the actions taken by the United States, the United Kingdom and France.\u0026quotThis will reduce the regime\u0027s ability to further attack the people of Syria with chemical weapons.\u0026quotUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday called for restraint and for countries to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation in Syria after the United States, France and Britain carried out strikes.Guterres delayed a planned trip to Saudi Arabia to deal with the aftermath of the military action.\u0026quotI urge all member states to show restraint in these dangerous circumstances and to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation and worsen the suffering of the Syrian people,\u0026quot Guterres said in a statement.\u0026quotAny use of chemical weapons is abhorrent. The suffering it causes is horrendous,\u0026quot Guterres said.The UN chief said it was important to act in line with the UN charter and international law.He urged the UN Security Council to agree on establishing an inquiry that would identify the perpetrators of chemical attacks.European Council president Donald Tusk said the European Union would stand with its allies \u0026quoton the side of justice\u0026quot.\u0026quotStrikes by US, France and UK make it clear that Syrian regime together with Russia \u0026amp Iran cannot continue this human tragedy, at least not without cost,\u0026quot he wrote on Twitter.Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the EU commission, said the use of chemical weapons was \u0026quotunacceptable in any circumstances\u0026quot:Boris Johnson will meet with European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday at a meeting to dominated by the strikes on Syria, James Crisp reports from Brussels. Through the weekend, British diplomats and ministers will be in touch with their EU counterparts to lay the groundwork for discussion over Friday night\u0027s air strikes. EU Ministers are expected to back language condemning the use of chemical weapons in the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council. Before the joint US-UK and French attack, London and Paris was pushing to toughen up the language of the draft joint statement, which will decry the use of chemical weapons and the greying of the international line against their use. Those efforts are continuing. The debate among ministers will include discussion over the strike but also how to prevent the use of chemical weapons in the future and secure a ceasefire in Syria. Mr Johnson can expect support from other EU member states such as Belgium and the Netherlands. The meeting was always going to be important for Britain as it is the first Foreign Affairs Council after Theresa May secured EU support for condemning Russia for the Salisbury attack.The Telegraph understands the conclusions will take a tougher line on Russia and Iran than the statement agreed by EU leaders on March 21. This will not include sanctions at this stage but there is likely to be language stating that option remains on the table. Indonesia expressed concern over the airstrikes while strongly condemning the use of chemical weapons that caused the loss of many innocent lives, Nicola Smith reports.“Indonesia is concerned about unilateral actions by any parties, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, in response to the chemical weapons attack tragedy in Syria,” foreign ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir said.Jakarta argued that taking military actions without prior authorisation from the UN Security Council was not in line with international legal principles in the peaceful settlement of disputes.The country further requests the UN Security Council take immediate steps to resolve the crisis in Syria, reported the Jakarta Post.“For Indonesia, peace and stability in Syria can only be achieved through dialogue and an inclusive political process,” said Mr Arrmanatha.Meanwhile, the Philippine foreign ministry advised all its citizens in Syria to remain in their homes until further notice, said spokesman Elmer Cato.Cato said the Philippine charge d’affaires in Syria, Crescente Relacion, had “described the more or less one hour missile barrage” as “like New Year in Manila.”Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, has ruled out Canadian participation in the strikes but said that Canada supports the decision by its allies in the US, the United Kingdom and France.\u0026quotCanada condemns in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons in last week\u0027s attack in eastern Ghouta, Syria,\u0026quot said Mr Trudeau, in a statement issued from Lima, Peru, where he is attending the Summit of the Americas.\u0026quotCanada supports the decision by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to take action to degrade the Assad regime\u0027s ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people.\u0026quotWe will continue to work with our international partners to further investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Those responsible must be brought to justice.\u0026quotEarlier on Friday, Canada became the latest country to lay the blame for a deadly chemical-weapons attack in Syria last week at Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s doorstep, despite Russian suggestions to the contrary.\u0026quotWhen it comes to this use of chemical weapons, it is clear to Canada that chemical weapons were used and that they were used by the Assad regime,\u0026quot said Chrystia Freeland, Canadian foreign minister.Australia, a staunch ally of the US and a member of the Five Eyes security alliance, was not a part of the attacks on Damascus and Homs, but issued a statement lending its support to the coalition’s actions.Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, said in a statement jointly issued with the foreign and defence ministers: “The use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, under any circumstances is illegal and utterly reprehensible.“The Assad regime must not be allowed to commit such crimes with impunity.”Mr Turnbull said the strikes were “a calibrated, proportionate and targeted response”.“They send an unequivocal message to the Assad regime and its backers, Russia and Iran, that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.”Please review our commenting policySyrian strikes help Emmanuel Macron cement position as key Trump ally ahead of Washington visitStop sharing NHS data with Home Office, officials told Europe to see first genetically engineered patients using gene-splicing therapyLabour\u0026#39s \u0026#39unaffordable electoral bungs\u0026#39 could drive businesses out of Britain May announces £60 million fund to tackle scourge of  plastic in world\u0026#39s oceansLabour councillors standing for election pledge to help \u0026#39stop Brexit\u0026#39Donald Trump declared the US \u0026#39locked and loaded\u0026#39 for more strikes on SyriaProtect our salmon from poachers, volunteers demand as they say river deserves funding as it beats 58 others for yields Rules for modern romance for the over 50s – you can kiss on a first dateJudi Dench told by Cornish villagers to stop interfering in phone mast disputeFrench ski guides plead guilty to causing British banker\u0026#39s deathBoom in cocaine demand fuels increase in strength putting more lives at riskOrphaned fox cubs advertised for £120 each on Facebook as charities warn of wild animals being sold onlineBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent auditions: partial nudity, nerve-jangling jeopardy and an emotional Ant and Dec - reviewSyria airstrikes: US warns it is \u0026#39locked and loaded\u0026#39 if Assad uses chemical weapons again - latest newsComment: How the Republicans fell out of love with big business – and especially Silicon ValleyPrivate schools\u0026#39 \u0026#39corporate greed\u0026#39 is pricing out middle-class families, former St Pauls\u0026#39 headmaster says Agatha Christie\u0026#39s Ordeal by Innocence adapted for first time after her great-grandson gave his blessingHow I woke to missiles streaking over the Damascus night sky How the strikes against Syria unfolded, with phone calls from Chequers and a sky full of missilesWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"woke missiles streaking damascus night sky","story":"This wasn’t the usual sound of light artillery shelling against remaining rebel enclaves in Damascus which you normally hear.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesPrime Minister Theresa May gives a press conference at Downing Street following British military action, alongside US and France, against Syria.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Yes, that’s about where we are.“The government is listening on the important aspects of the bill and I think that’s what the overall tone of the debate from the crossbenchers will be – that, actually, the government is listening and taking appropriate action.“But there was always going to be a time when this type of amendment, the customs union amendment, was going to cause a bit of a clash. We’ll just have to see how the debate goes.”In advance of Wednesday, Brexit minister Lord Callanan has tabled a small number of government amendments in response to earlier debates, but Tory insiders have been at pains to underline how they are technical in nature and do not “compromise” on the major principles of the Bill, with Conservative right-wingers keeping a close eye on proceedings.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

If the election were held today, frankly, I think Republicans would lose both,” the conservative pollster said on Fox News.Republican governor warns party is at risk of Democratic gainsRepublican finally concedes special election in ominous sign for TrumpHillary Clinton says \u0027the Russians are coming\u0027 ahead of midtermsRepublicans fear a \u0027bloodbath\u0027 in midterm electionsAmerica’s best known public opinion guru partially heaped blame on Mr Trump for the Republican Party\u0027s dwindling electoral hopes.“If Donald Trump wants to keep the Republican Congress, he has to differentiate when he’s attacking Congress in general versus the Republicans in Congress,” he said.“Differentiate when he’s attacking the press versus when he feels he’s not getting a fair shake”.Mr Luntz argued the economy had flourished under the Trump administration but that the president failed to gain proper recognition for it. He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She looks at me like I’m making a big mistake – she would turn out to be right.Getting to France from Brussels to cover the rail strikes that are paralysing the country is proving rather difficult. It’s normally a breezy half an hour to Lille on a high speed TGV from The Independent’s bureau in the Belgian capital, but those few services that are still running were booked up weeks in advance. I had managed to snag a ticket on the Eurostar, but that was then cancelled too, so decide to do the entire journey by slow Belgian suburban services – which aren’t on strike despite sometimes venturing over the border into France. It would take a while, but get me there eventually, or so I thought.Eurostar cancels trains as Macron protests erupt across ParisAn hour into my journey my optimism is shattered when a smartly uniformed train guard taps me on the shoulder. “Lille?” he asks. I nod, and he explains that the connecting Belgian service I was planning to take is now cancelled and I’ll have an extra hour’s wait at Tournai, the border city where I was planning to sneak into France.I do my time at Tournai’s ornate station alongside a gaggle of other fools braving the industrial dispute, and my train to France finally pulls in. But before it has ground to a halt, déjà vu strikes. “Lille?” I turn around, and another guard is standing there. I nod, like last time. “There is no Lille… they are blocking the way.” It turns out the French rail workers have anticipated my crafty workaround and, as well as stopping French services, have now physically blockaded the tracks to prevent Belgian trains getting anywhere near France as well. Of the dozen other travellers I am standing with, one looks distraught – but most shrug and accept that this is the way of things. “It’s a strike,” one man tells me. “It’s how it goes.” My train sits empty in the station, and will go no further.British commuters may think they know about rail strikes, but the French do them properly. Workers are walking off the job for 36 days scattered throughout April, May and June, with as many as four stoppages at week. France has invested heavily in its high speed rail network since the 1970s, and the country now relies on TGV services to get things done. Why is France\u0027s transport network mired in strikes?Air France strikes see a third of flights cancelledFrance strikes: another disrupted weekend for air and rail passengersFrance to cut number of MPs by almost a thirdWhen those trains don’t work, neither does the country. About 40 per cent of rail workers have participated in the strikes so far, and SNCF, the French national railway company, says it is running just one in three services and is urging passengers to stay away. Some cities also have separate strikes on their local bus and metro systems, with workers in, for example, Rouen taking 55 minutes out a day until late April – just enough to mess up timetables. You’d be forgiven for thinking otherwise, but in France only around 8 per cent of workers are union members – far fewer than even in Britain, where about 25 per cent of employees pay dues. But despite the low membership across the economy, unionised workers are highly concentrated and more prepared to take direct action – like blockading international railway tracks.The reason behind the national rail strike is Emmanuel Macron’s plans to cut conditions for workers on the French railways. The government wants to end guaranteed job security and early pensions for SNCF employees, and says the move to cut workers’ compensation is the only way to reduce the €47bn in legacy debt the national rail company has on its books. But the industrial dispute has taken on wider political connotations, and has turned into a key test for Macron’s liberalising economic agenda – with comparisons inevitably drawn to Margaret Thatcher and the miners\u0027 strike.  Emmanuel Macron is not popular – but appears to have public backing on his changes to SNCF (Etienne LaurentPool Photo via AP)The French president made his first major statement on the strike in a television interview on Thursday, pledging that he would not back down. “We must go to the end, because we have to make this reform. It is indispensable. It would be hypocritical not to do it we need a strong French railway,” he told TF1. “The reform requires a little effort from everyone. Users have made efforts, prices have increased. We ask the company, SNCF, that it must reorganise.”But union leaders have taken an equally tough stance. “We\u0027re going to have a marathon if the government forces it,” Laurent Brun of the CGT rail union said on Friday after two days of talks with government negotiators. He hinted that the strike could be extended beyond its scheduled end on 28 June if the government did not back down or make concessions.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesThe wreckage of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre compound in the Barzeh district, north of Damascus, after the United States, UK and France launched strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime early on April 14 in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack after mulling military action for nearly a week.
