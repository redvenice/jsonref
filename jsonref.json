Sarah Pennells, consumer finance specialist at Royal London, says: Unite’s general secretary Sharon Graham says the union will continue to base claims on the RPI figure rather than CPI because it better reflects the actual price rise experienced by Unite members. Paul Dales of Capital Economics says November’s jump gives the Bank enough ammunition to raise interest rates tomorrow. But it is more likely, he suggests, to wait until it knows more about the Omicron situation.  Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, explains: The price of petrol rose by 7.2 pence per litre between October and November 2021, the largest monthly rise on record (since 1990).  Second-hand car prices kept rising, lifted by increased demand following the end of the most recent national lockdown, and delays to new car supplies due to semiconductor shortages. Clothing and footwear also provided a large upward contribution, the ONS says: Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices rose too: And alcohol and tobacco prices increased, partly because tax changes kicked in, the ONS says: These are the highest annual rates for these classes since early 2009, the ONS says.Prices surged across the economy, with transport, including motor fuel and second hand cars, food, energy, other housing and household services, clothing and footwear costs all rising. Inflation is now rising faster than pay, meaning people face falling real wages again. Faced with this inflation surge, the US central bank is likely to decide to wrap up its bond-buying stimulus programme faster, when policymakers meet today. That would free the Federal Reserve up to raise interest rates faster next year, if needed. Fears that the Fed will announce a faster ‘taper’ tonight hit stocks on Wall Street yesterday.

Photograph: iStockParents who decide not to vaccinate their younger children against Covid-19 have been told they face a greater risk of missing school and other activities through contracting the virus.The warning comes as part of a public information campaign rolled out on Tuesday, designed to answer numerous questions parents and s may have before making a decision.“Registration for the vaccine will open shortly,” the HSE said on Tuesday, launching the information drive, “with priority being placed on children who are more at risk from Covid-19.”The HSE, through an online information page, says: “If you decide not to get your child vaccinated, there is a greater risk they could get Covid-19.“Their symptoms will most likely be mild if they get the virus, but they will still need to isolate from others. This means they may miss school and other activities.”Children aged five to 11 will be offered a lower dose of Pfizer BioNTech, known as Comirnaty, and will require two doses, three weeks apart. The HSE has said that despite the smaller quantity, the immunity will be similar to the higher dose vaccine used in older age groups.MRNA vaccines teach the body to make a protein that triggers an immune response without using the live virus that causes Covid-19. The body can then produce antibodies to help fight the infection should the virus enter the system.According to the information campaign, thousands of people have been vaccinated as part of clinical trials around the world and “no new safety concerns were reported in children aged five to 15”.Long-CovidThis vaccine has been given to millions of children in the five to 15 age group in the US, Canada and Israel and it is recommended in other European countries.“Very rarely, people may develop myocarditis and pericarditis after getting the PfizerBioNTech vaccine. Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory heart conditions. The risk of these very rare conditions is higher in younger men,” the dedicated HSE web page says.“Early data from other countries shows myocarditis is less likely in those aged 12-15 than those aged 16-24. Data on children aged 5-11 is very limited so far.”As has been well established, the majority of children who contract Covid-19 have very mild or no symptoms at all. However, they are required to isolate from other people to prevent spreading it.Other upsides of the vaccine, according to medical experts, is that it can help prevent a child developing long-Covid symptoms such as fatigue, which can continue for weeks or months.In rare cases the virus has caused a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), also known as paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS). This causes pneumonia, inflammation of the heart, difficulty breathing and can prove fatal in some cases. Most reported cases were recorded in boys between the ages of one and 14.Dr Lucy Jessop, director of the National Immunisation Office (NIO), acknowledged that parents would have concerns and questions.“We also know that they want to get information from a trusted source like the HSE, their GP or other healthcare professionals,” she said.On Tuesday, Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman announced the introduction from December 15th of an antigen testing programme for responding to Covid-19 cases in early learning and childcare services.Under the programme, antigen tests will be available to children aged four and over and staff in a pod where there is a confirmed Covid-19 case.RestrictionsMeanwhile, the Department of Education said there were no plans to close schools early ahead of the Christmas break.Some health experts and school principals have suggested that early closure could limit the spread of Covid-19 .However, a spokesman for the department said the scheduling of school holiday periods are not due to change.“There are no plans to alter the school break at Christmas. There is no evidence to suggest that extending school holidays has a public health rationale,” a department spokesman said.Primary and secondary schools are due to close for the Christmas break on Wednesday, December 22nd and reopen on Thursday, January 6th.Dublin City University professor of immunology Christine Loscher said closing schools this Friday would minimise children’s exposure to the virus, especially in light of the highly transmissible Omicron variant.“This will give a decent circuit breaker and ensure we can open schools in January,” she said.Denmark announced last week that it was closing schools early due to the threat posed by the Omicron variant, while the UK government said it will only close schools early in the event of an “absolute public health emergency”.Some principals here say they expect many parents will opt to keep their children at home next week for safety reasons.Matt Melvin, principal of St Etchen’s National School in Kinnegad, Co Westmeath, said his school was organising its Christmas events this week in case they were advised to close early.“We’re preparing, just in case,” he said. “Whatever decision that is taken should be in the best interests of public health and children – but it must be taken quickly.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"poll shows public divided down the middle on additional restrictions","story":"A large queue at the walk-in centre for Covid-19 booster vaccines at the National Show Centre in Swords, Co Dublin on Tuesday. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe public is evenly split on further restrictions, with 44 per cent opposed to additional measures and 41 per cent supporting them, according to new polling data.Over the past week, there has been an uptick in people adhering to public health measures such as social distancing and staying at home, the survey for the Department of Health shows. However, there was a drop in adherence to measures among younger people.Some 51 per cent of the population think the Government response to the pandemic is appropriate and 35 per cent say it is insufficient, while the proportion who say it is too extreme fell from 21 per cent to 14 per cent in a week.One person in five says Ireland is trying to return to normal too slowly, but 38 per cent believe this is happening too fast and 42 per cent say it is happening at the right pace.Another 3,887 cases of Covid-19 were reported in the State on Tuesday.As of 8am on Tuesday, there were 493 Covid-19 patients in hospital, of which 109 were in ICU.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the results indicated that approximately 14 per cent of the State’s new infections were now due to the new Omicron variant.The Government has asked the health service to provide a revised Covid-19 booster plan that will immediately accelerate the level of vaccinations within days.RedeployedThis will involve longer opening hours at centres, new satellite centres and staff being redeployed from across the public sector.There were queues at a number of vaccination centres again on Tuesday, including at the National Show Centre in Swords, Co Dublin. Most people said they were waiting between 90 minutes and two hours to get their booster.In Northern Ireland, four further patients who had previously tested positive for Covid-19 have died, the North’s department of health said, and another 1,581 cases of the virus were reported.Also on Tuesday, the Government announced that Ireland had increased its Covid-19 vaccine donation commitments to a further three million vaccine doses.This is in addition to the Government’s previous commitment to donate two million vaccines through international agencies.“While our national vaccination programme continues with the rollout and acceleration of the booster programme, it is vitally important that we ensure that vaccines reach those who need them most across the globe,” Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said.“Our donated vaccines have already been delivered to a number of countries including Uganda, Nigeria and Indonesia. The latest consignment will shortly arrive in Ghana and further doses will be delivered to lower-income countries over the coming weeks and months.”Antiviral pillMeanwhile, Pfizer on Tuesday said final analysis of its antiviral Covid-19 pill still showed near 90 per cent efficacy in preventing hospitalisations and deaths in high-risk patients, and recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against the fast-spreading Omicron variant of coronavirus.The US drugmaker last month said the oral medicine was about 89 per cent effective in preventing hospitalisations or deaths when compared to placebos, based on interim results in about 1,200 people. The data disclosed on Tuesday includes an additional 1,000 people.Nobody in the trial who received the Pfizer treatment died, compared with 12 deaths among placebo recipients.The Pfizer pills are taken with the older antiviral ritonavir every 12 hours for five days beginning shortly after onset of symptoms. If authorised, the treatment will be sold as Paxlovid.Pfizer also released early data from a second clinical trial showing that the treatment reduced hospitalisations by about 70 per cent in about 600 standard-risk adults.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"rush to add hundreds of gps and pharmacists to covid booster programme in race against omicron","story":"The State’s booster campaign is to see  a massive redeployment of healthcare and public sector staff. File photograph: The The State’s booster campaign is to be overhauled with a massive redeployment of healthcare and public sector staff, who will be asked to prioritise Covid-19 vaccinations in the face of a potentially imminent Omicron wave.Hundreds more general practitioners and pharmacists will be asked to join the booster programme as the State races against time to give the population adequate protection against the latest Covid-19 variant.The Government is extremely resistant to the idea of any major new restrictions and is placing the focus firmly on the revised vaccination campaign which will be launched imminently by the HSE.Many vaccination centres will have extended opening hours, from 8am to 8pm, there will be extra centres in Dublin and Cork and other areas as well as increased capacity in existing centres and provisions made for record levels of testing.A source said the inoculation campaign had now entered its most challenging period since last January and that multiple workforces would be redeployed in the latest battle against the novel coronavirus.The Government will lean heavily on general practitioners as part of a “national effort” to prioritise vaccinations, meaning there will be less availability for other health issues. The plan is to have every GP vaccinating the public, up from the estimated 75 per cent currently providing this service. The Government also wants to see 1,000 pharmacies giving the jabs, up from about 550.The pace of the campaign will be accelerated and from December 20th the inoculation of high-risk children will begin, with other cohorts following from January 10th.Next doseA senior source said that people in their 30s and 40s can expect to hear “this side of Christmas” when they will be offered the next dose.Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Tuesday night called on the country to “hold the collective nerve” as the latest figures show that approximately 1.25 million have received a booster shot.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said results on Tuesday indicated that approximately 14 per cent of the State’s new infections were now due to the new Omicron variant.He updated the Coalition’s three party leaders on Tuesday night about the state of play ahead of a crunch meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) on Thursday.Government figures are extremely resistant to any suggestion of harsh new restrictions, while Mr Martin has said there is no plan to close schools early “at this stage”.He told RTÉ that a “collective objective of all of us is to keep schools open”.A spokesman for the Department of Education said the scheduling of school holiday periods are not due to change.“There are no plans to alter the school break at Christmas. There is no evidence to suggest that extending school holidays has a public health rationale.”The Netherlands announced on Tuesday that it would close primary schools a week earlier amid concern about children infecting older relatives over Christmas.VulnerableMeanwhile, there is concern in Government about younger age groups who got the one-shot Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine and who may be especially vulnerable now as they wait their turn. The issue has been raised with Dr Holohan and the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac).The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Tuesday Covid-19 vaccines appeared to have become slightly less effective in preventing severe disease and death, but did provide “significant protection”.The Omicron variant first detected in South Africa and Hong Kong last month has now been reported by 77 countries and is probably present in most worldwide, but should not be dismissed as “mild”, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.“Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant.“Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"gps aim to double number of covid booster vaccines they administer","story":"Many vaccination centres will also have extended opening hours, from 8am to 8pm. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireThe Government is hesitant to implement any major new restrictions to halt the spread of Covid-19 this Christmas and is instead focusing on the rollout of booster vaccines to protest the population from the new Omicron variant.The number of GPs and pharmacists involved in administering booster vaccines is to be increased across the State as part of a “national effort” to prioritise vaccinations.Currently, 75 per cent of GPs are vaccinating the public, though the Government now aims to get all GPs involved, as well as to double the number of pharmacies providing the booster jabs.Dr Mary Favier, Covid lead for the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP), said the message from GPs to those awaiting a booster dose was “Don’t call us, we’ll call you”.“We need everybody to co-operate on this,” she added. GPs would be delaying all non-essential work to focus on delivering the booster campaign in the coming weeks, she said.The booster vaccines will be administered on an appointment basis with supplies being ordered on Wednesday, so it was likely to be next week before the campaign would commence in earnest.GPs would need to plan the campaign and would call patients when they were due their booster, she said.Dr Favier also said the 15 minute post-vaccine wait time was “a significant challenge” for GPs and “a big limiting step”. If removed, as had been done in the UK, it would allow GPs to vaccinate more patients, she said. Many vaccination centres will also have extended opening hours, from 8am to 8pm.Opposition parties criticised the Taoiseach in the Dáil about delays in the booster programme so far.“We’ve seen problems with the alignment of the booking system between the HSE, GPs and pharmacies. This means that people have received multiple appointments which stay on the system, even when people tried to cancel,” Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said on Tuesday.The “lack of government planning” meant Ireland was “down 500 vaccinators since the summer,” Ms McDonald said.Whether or not any fresh restrictions are introduced will depend on a meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) on Thursday, as the Government is likely to be reluctant to deviate from the guidance of chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and others.Meanwhile, infectious diseases expert Professor Sam McConkey has called on the HSE to rebuild vaccination capacity so that “most of the population” could be given a booster vaccine in the next 20 days.He also encouraged businesses to make contingency plans in case the Omicron variant infects staff.While the new variant appeared not to cause serious illness, he told Newstalk Breakfast that it remained clinically unknown how serious the symptoms could be.Prof McConkey encouraged businesses to have “stand-ins” ready for important roles, and even to have “stand-ins” for the “stand-ins”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"eu prepared to move unilaterally on ni medicines coveney says","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe European Union is prepared to move ahead unilaterally with legal changes to ensure the flow of medicines into Northern Ireland if agreement with the United Kingdom cannot be found, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Discussions are ongoing this week between the EU and UK teams to try to come to an agreement, with lead negotiators Maros Sefcovic and David Frost set to meet twice in a bid to make progress by Christmas.Mr Coveney said it was possible that there could be a breakthrough on medicines by then, but that broader issues including on customs and food, plant and animal checks would not be agreed by the end of this year.“Between now and Christmas it is possible I hope to find agreement on the medicines issue,” Mr Coveney said.“I think the EU is anxious to move ahead unilaterally on that, if the UK doesn’t agree an approach, because certainly the EU wants to ensure that medicines can flow freely into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.“The other issues we know in all likelihood are not going to be resolved between now and the end of the year: SPS checks, customs checks and a range of other issues.”Red lineTime is short on medicines, as a grace period on enforcing EU standards on medicines that are shipped from Britain into Northern Ireland is set to expire on January 1st.On Friday a British official briefed London-based journalists that the UK government no longer considered the removal of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as an arbiter of disputes over Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit arrangements to be a red line in negotiations.However, chief negotiator Mr Frost subsequently tweeted that the issue of governance “including the Court of Justice” remained an issue, adding: “We will not find a durable solution that does not deal with all these problems.”Mr Coveney said that the briefing had been “retracted”.“Clearly there was a briefing that has essentially been retracted. So look, I think we shouldn’t make a big deal of it, to be honest,” he said.“I think we have to go on what what David Frost says. He’s the chief negotiator he speaks for the prime minister on Brexit issues.”Before it was retracted, the dropping of the ECJ red line was heralded as an encouraging sign that a deal could be near, particularly as it was followed by the granting of 23 extra licences to French fishing boats by the UK government, easing tensions on another contentious issue.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson warned in recent months that it would use the sensitive article 16 clause to unilaterally suspend the enforcement of the post-Brexit arrangements designed to avoid a hard border unless concessions were granted, but subsequently appeared to move away from the idea."},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord when it comes to christmas craic sinn f%C3%A9in is an absolute hoot","story":"‘I dressed for the occasion in red, a Ceann Comhairle.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMicheál decided not to treat the chamber to a festive warble on his last Dáil appearance of 2021.Mary Lou was scarlet for him.Understandably, with the end in sight, he was in good spirits. But he had no intention of losing the run of himself either.“I won’t take off Chris de Burgh,” promised the Taoiseach.Aah, go on. It’s Christmas.He was spoilt for choice. But what particular song was on Micheál’s mind before his final Leaders’ Questions of the year?Patricia the Asset Stripper?High on Boiled Eggs?The Taoiseach didn’t say, but there could be only one Chris de Burgh tune worth crooning under the circumstances, for sitting across the floor from him was a Sinn Féin vision in crimson.What a way to round off the session. Micheál serenading Mary Lou across a crowded chamber: his Lady in Red.We’ll just leave that image there, so as not to ruin the Christmas entirely.This was all the Ceann Comhairle’s fault. Seán Ó Fearghail was so desperate for some seasonal cheer he wondered, as he called on the Sinn Féin leader, “Are you going to inject some Christmas spirit?”If he was looking for a dollop of yuletide merriment he can’t be faulted for turning to that party’s president for a dig out because when it comes to the Christmas craic, Sinn Féin is an absolute hoot. And if it’s good enough for Merry Gerry, her predecessor, then it’s good enough for Mary Lou.Perhaps he was hoping she might delight the Dáil with another little number from Gerry’s IRA handbook, sorry, songbook.Then Eoin Ó Broin could apologise afterwards for her poor judgement, swiftly followed by Matt Carthy and David Cullinane taking the apology back, followed by Carthy apologising for his apology but still not taking it back.Wisely, Mary Lou left the dodgy singing to former deputy Adams but, in an effort to help the chair, she pointed out that she made an effort on the sartorial front.“I dressed for the occasion in red, a Ceann Comhairle,” she replied. “I think it would be a bit much to don the beard and the hat, so I left it.”Whereupon Micheál remarked bashfully about not doing a reprise of Chris de Burgh’s hit song, the one which became synonymous with the late Princess Diana.“Although I might get a more polite response from An Taoiseach if I was attired in that manner,” she added, long of the view that she never gets a proper answer to her questions during their weekly heckle sessions.Mary Lou looked very glam in her scarlet satin jacket with matching scarlet skirt and camisole. All dressed up, but had she anywhere to go? Her Sinn Féin colleagues in the chamber on Tuesday seemed in great form too, maybe they were going to enjoy some Covid restricted acceptable socialising later in the evening?Best not to tell fun-lovin’ Crimbo party animal Gerry though. He’d probably be the one roaring “Shots! Shots! Shots!” at his former charges between rounds and dropping Jägerbombs into their pints, for the laughs.The Taoiseach is away in Brussels on EU business for the next while so he got his greetings in early, wishing Opposition deputies and Leinster House staff a Happy Christmas and thanking the Ceann Comhairle for his tolerance and patience.“I hope it can last another session.” Mary Lou also extended compliments of the season to one and all before launching into the vexed question of booster shots and how quickly they can be jabbed into as many arms as possible before Christmas. The Government hasn’t been fast enough with the rollout, she contended, telling the Taoiseach his urgency has come very late in the day. “We needed the ‘all hands on deck’ approach two months ago.”Furthermore, she said, “the slower number of boosters administered in this third round of vaccinations has nothing to do with a public lack of willingness to come forward” and all to do with “operational” issues.“We are a highly vaccinated population,” she reminded Micheál as we yearned for those less complicated days when politicians talked of a “highly educated” population or a “highly progressive population”.The Taoiseach is among the highly vaccinated. “I took Moderna myself on Friday. I waited in a queue, in a line. The mood was great. People talked to each other. Lots and lots of people are waiting in line and happy to get the booster vaccine.”Away from Covid, Mattie McGrath pleaded for funds to complete the refurbishment of South Tipperary General Hospital. He said the Taoiseach recently visited the hospital and met management. The building is three quarters finished and he was quoted at the time as saying he couldn’t understand how the job wasn’t done as it was “low hanging fruit”.Mattie kept up the fruit theme.“Whether it be apples, pears or oranges – I hope it’s not bananas – we want this fruit. And it has to be delivered for the management there, the very hardworking staff and to the patients. . . Why don’t you give them the low hanging fruit?”Micheál, a great man for the fruit, was concerned that Mattie didn’t appear to have much time for bananas.“Can I just say, bananas are very good for you and you should eat one a day,” he told an unimpressed McGrath.“They repeat on you,” he responded.“But they contain plenty of potassium.”The Taoiseach assured him that the department and the HSE was actively looking into providing extra capacity. And he finished with some parting advice for the Independent TD for Tipperary.“Anyway, you should not forget the odd banana in future.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sinn f%C3%A9in tds differ over whether gerry adams should apologise for christmas sketch","story":"Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin has called for Gerry Adams to apologise for his part in a Christmas video that has since been withdrawn after victims of the Provisional IRA described the production as insensitive and in poor taste.The video featured Gerry Adams in a comedy sketch in which he sings “Tis the season to be jolly, tiocfaidh ár lá, lá, lá, lá”. Photograph: Getty ImagesSinn Féin TDs have expressed differing views over whether or not former party leader Gerry Adams should apologise for his part in a Christmas video that has since been withdrawn following complaints from victims of the Provisional IRA.Waterford TD David Cullinane and Cavan-Monaghan Deputy Matt Carthy said Mr Adams did not have anything to say sorry for, while Dublin’s Eoin Ó Broin had previously called on him to apologise.The video featured Mr Adams, the former Sinn Féin president, in a comedy sketch in which he sings “Tis the season to be jolly, tiocfaidh ár lá, lá, lá, lá”.In the sketch, Mr Adams visits a house as a carol singer and the homeowner repeats a slogan first used by Mr Adams in August 1995 in relation to the Provisional IRA: “They haven’t gone away you know.”Mr Cullinane said Mr Adams had nothing to apologise for and the context in which the sketch was recorded should be taken into consideration.“This was a video that was done for a charity and I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that this was done with the best of intentions. This was done for the Foyle Search and Rescue, which is an organisation that does incredible work and saves people’s lives.“I don’t believe anybody from that organisation or indeed Gerry Adams set out to offend anybody and no, I don’t believe Gerry Adams has anything to apologise for.“My understanding is that the video has been removed and has been withdrawn and I think that is appropriate and I think that should be the end of it.” Mr Cullinane himself drew controversy last year when he shouted “Up the ‘Ra. Tiocfaidh ár Lá” at the end of a victory speech after the general election. He subsequently apologised.Bryan Dobson on RTÉ’s News at One programme on Tuesday asked Mr Cullinane if he was now saying to victims of IRA violence that “they just have to suck this up”. Mr Cullinane replied: “That’s not what I’m saying and what I’ve said very clearly is that this video was done for a charity. I made a mistake in the past and I put my hands up. I accepted that and I apologised. “I don’t think Gerry Adams made a mistake. I think the context was different. I’ve explained the difference.”‘Different views’Earlier, Mr Carthy, speaking to Claire Byrne on RTÉ Radio 1 on Tuesday morning, said of the video: “Different people will have different views in terms of whether it’s actually funny or not. “But it was done for a good cause. It was done to raise money for Derry search and rescue operations and to my mind that’s the context that it has to be taken in.”The presenter put it to Mr Carthy that phrases such as “Tiocfaidh ár lá” and “They haven’t gone away you know” were very upsetting for some people.“It may well be but ‘Tiocfaidh ár lá’ is a political phrase. I’ve used it myself in my own lifetime. I don’t consider that it’s a basis for someone to have to apologise.”The presenter then put it to Mr Carthy that Mr Ó Broin had said Mr Adams should apologise.“I didn’t hear Eoin Ó Broin’s remarks but I don’t think that Gerry Adams has anything to apologise for,” Mr Carthy said. He said Mr Adams was retired.“I don’t think anybody could suggest that Gerry Adams doesn’t understand reconciliation. He has done a huge amount for peace in our country. He has played a pivotal role in the development of the peace process, in bringing about an end to violence.“As I say, he’s retired from public life. He’s engaged in a number of activities and one of the activities he’s engaged in is to support a charity and he did.”During his radio contribution Mr Carthy responded to criticism from Fine Gael Minister of State Peter Burke on the video.“Gerry Adams participated in it.“I think there are some who are trying to manipulate that for petty party politics.”Mr Carthy took to Twitter on Tuesday evening to correct his remarks. Mr Carthy confirmed to The  that the charity contacted him to ask him to make the clarification.Online Christmas cardThe video sketch featuring Mr Adams had appeared as an online Christmas card with the greeting “Have a Gerry Christmas”.The greeting card company later withdrew the video and the greeting card after families of IRA victims raised their concerns.Ferry Clever, the Derry-based company behind the video and Christmas card, said its business is based on “satirical comedy” and that it was “never our intention to offend anyone”. It was intended to raise money for Foyle Search and Rescue, which patrols Derry’s riverways engaging with people in distress.In an interview for Déise Today on WLR FM, Mr Ó Broin said “Tiocfaidh ár lá” was a “long-standing political slogan and I don’t have a problem with it being used”. However, the Dublin Mid-West TD said people should be careful with their language with reconciliation in mind.Asked by presenter Damien Tiernan should Mr Adams apologise, Mr Ó Broin replied: “Let me say one thing before I give you a straight yes or no answer. I don’t believe for a second Gerry either intended to cause hurt or offence to anybody I really don’t. But given the fact that offence has been caused, yes, I think for him to apologise for the offence that has been caused would be helpful.”Mr Ó Broin said: “Tiocfaidh ár lá is a political slogan. It means ‘our day will come’ and for republicans like me when that phrase is said it means our day will come in terms of a united Ireland. “It is a long-standing political slogan and I don’t have a problem with it being used. But what I’m saying to you is: as we are navigating our way out of conflict . . . all of us have to be very mindful of the language that we use.

Although he did not impose any further restrictions, he warned of a tidal wave of omicron and said that from bitter experience the situation could deteriorate rapidly. His address suggested further restrictions may have to be enforced if the target to administer the third dose to one million people a day till the new year was not met. He said: Get boosted now for yourself, for your friends and your family. Get boosted now to protect jobs and livelihoods across this country. Get boosted now to protect our NHS, our freedoms and our way of life. Here is everything we know so far about Plan B.As of December 10, face coverings became compulsory in most public indoor venues, such as cinemas, theatres and places of worship. However, there are exemptions for hospitality venues.The Prime Minister also advised “those who can” to work from home from December 13.And from December 15, the NHS Covid Pass will become mandatory for entry into nightclubs and settings where large crowds gather – including unseated indoor events with 500 or more attendees, unseated outdoor events with 4,000 or more attendees and any event with 10,000 or more attendees.The Prime Minister said that the measures will be reviewed on January 5 and will automatically expire on January 26.The Prime Minister said that people should not cancel their Christmas parties or nativity plays. However, he suggested that they should take a Covid test before attending any festive events.Speaking at a Downing Street press conference earlier in December, Boris Johnson said: On Christmas, the best way to ensure we have a Christmas as close to normal as possible is to get on with Plan B - irritating though it may be, it is not a lockdown, it is Plan B, it is what we set out a while back - and to get your booster and to get your jab.Asked about whether festive parties and nativity plays should be cancelled, he replied: No, in my view they should not.”They should follow the guidance, of course, but we are not saying we want kids to be taken out of school before the end of term - not that there is very long to go now - and we don\u0027t want nativity plays to be cancelled.We think that it is OK currently, on what we can see, to keep going with Christmas parties, but obviously everybody should exercise due caution, have ventilation, wash your hands, get a test before you go - (it is) a sensible thing to do to give everybody else at the party the confidence that they are going to be meeting someone who is not contagious.As of December 10, face coverings became compulsory in places of worship.However, the Prime Minister said that people who are “singing” are exempt from face masks, meaning those attending Christmas services are able to remove their face coverings when joining in carols. In England, face coverings are already required in shops and shopping centres.Hospitality settings are exempt from face mask rules meaning people attending Christmas meals in pubs or restaurants are not required to wear a face covering.The Prime Minister did not announce any extra international travel restrictions at the Downing Street press conference or during his national address. As such, the situation stands from the added travel restrictions that were already in place following the discovery of the omicron variant.Eleven African countries were added to the travel red list and a number of nations – including France, Portugal and Spain – are imposing stricter restrictions on arrivals from the UK.  Travel testing rules had also already been tightened: anyone travelling to the UK must now take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival, and self-isolate until they have received a negative result – regardless of the country they are travelling from, or their vaccination status. Additionally, all people aged 12 years and over must take a PCR or lateral flow test before they travel to England from abroad.This article is being kept updated with the latest news and Government guidance daily.More from NewsCovid latest news: Having coronavirus in past six months leaves you \u0026#39relatively well protected\u0026#39 from omicronFull list of Tory rebels who opposed No 10\u0026#39s Covid pass planCovid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you as omicron cases riseReading fire: Man arrested on suspicion of murder and arson as \u0026#39number of people unaccounted for\u0026#39\u0026#39More than 300\u0026#39 trapped in Hong Kong skyscraper after fireMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"can save victorian beauty traditional high streets","story":"Let us walk down a local high street in the noisy hubbub of a Victorian summer just over a century ago. Costermongers hawk their wares children stare at huge lollipops in the grocer’s window alongside piles of potted jams and pickles gaily striped awnings protect the butcher’s meats from the sun the sweet smell of bread escapes from the baker’s open door the inn advertises, in large gold-leafed letters, that “Ales, Stout \u0026amp Porter” are for sale. Market stalls, horse dung, water troughs, gently curving Georgian bay windows thick with a century’s encrusted paint. All life is here.A nostalgic memory? Undoubtedly. But for many a painful one. In too many high streets the current reality is one of no homes, fewer shops and scarce businesses. Many lovely Victorian and early 20th century shops are in desperate peril.The Victorian Society’s top 10 endangered buildings list includes a Peckham department store and a Stoke-on-Trent indoor market. Just last month, Westminster council shamefully gave M\u0026ampS permission to demolish its beautiful 1930 Oxford Street branch to replace it with a tedious and unvarying grid of identical windows. We can call this “spreadsheet architecture”.These buildings are universally lamented as soon as they are lost, but somehow it carries on happening. Nobody argues that our towns are improved by their loss. Nobody argues that it is more environmentally friendly to replace them rather than refurbish them. And yet these buildings continue to go.We can, however, go some way towards correcting this horrific trend. The aftermath of the pandemic, which has exacerbated the crumbling of traditional high street infrastructure, has given us an opportunity.Vanishingly few early 20th century traditional buildings are listed by Historic England, trapped by a definition of “architectural significance” that regards architectural history as a fast train to modernism. No specialised body exists whose heart is in the fight for these lovely buildings with their rich stylistic range: Bankers’ Georgian, Deco, Classical, Néo-Grec, Renaissance, and so on. So let us empower those who have the capacity to take this task on.We should then adapt the VAT system, which is biased in favour of new builds versus renovation. This particularly matters in “left behind” towns where most incentives are to let high streets rot and restart elsewhere. The Government should make it VAT-free to bring derelict buildings back into use or charge a reduced rate of 5 per cent.Most importantly, we should let high streets come back to complex life again as agreeable places where people live and work as well as shop.Internet shopping is here to stay, but thanks to welcome innovations over the past decade, mechanisms exist which councils could use to make it easier for owners to invest in converting buildings for other uses. None are fully taking the opportunity, nervous of ceding control.A flourishing high street is an attractive place where people wish to live, to meet, to converse, to buy, to sell and to be amused. We cannot go back to the 1890s but there’s nothing to stop future high streets being even better. And there won’t be any horse dung.Nicholas Boys Smith is the Director of Create StreetsMore from NewsCovid latest news: Having coronavirus in past six months leaves you \u0026#39relatively well protected\u0026#39 from omicronFull list of Tory rebels who opposed No 10\u0026#39s Covid pass planCovid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you as omicron cases riseCovid Plan B: How it will affect your Christmas plansReading fire: Man arrested on suspicion of murder and arson as \u0026#39number of people unaccounted for\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eadruf cross shaped pendant covered runes reveals mysterious","story":"“Who was Eadruf?” historians are asking, after the discovery of a cross-shaped pendant which revealed a new and “mysterious” Anglo-Saxon name.Detectorists found an 8th or 9th-century golden cross on the shores of the River Tweed, near Berwick, in 2020 - an area that was formerly part of a religious centre in the Kingdom of Northumbria.Studies of the pendant have revealed it was etched with runes that spell out “Eadruf”, a previously unknown name that experts have described as “etymologically mysterious”.While “Ead” may mean something like “fortune” or “happiness”, Prof John Hines, an archaeologist and linguist, has said: “No personal name element ‘ruf’ can be identified in any Germanic language.”The discovery of the inscribed pendant, announced as part of the British Museum\u0027s annual summary of finds from across the UK, has prompted speculation as to the identity of the only Eadruf ever recorded.The use of gold to craft the cross suggests that its owner was likely a high-status figure, with possible links to Anglo-Saxon royalty or monastic communities.Prof Hines, of the University of Cardiff, has suggested that the unique moniker “Eadruf” could be an early Medieval nickname formed from the contraction of a name popular with “the upper social strata in Northumbria in the 9th century”.It is possible, Prof Hines has said, that the newly unearthed epithet derives from “Eardwulf” - a name shared by notable historical figures, including a deposed and exiled king of Northumbria.It has also been suggested that the owner of the mysterious golden cross was Eardwulf of Lindisfarne, who was bishop of the monastic community when it began a long migration from its historic base on Holy Island to Durham in the 9th-century.While the identity of Eadruf remains a mystery, Ben Westwood, Durham finds liaison officer, who is responsible for recording archaeological discoveries, said the pendant owner was “clearly embedded in … the early medieval, early Christian fabric of the North East region”.The golden cross was one of 50,000 finds made in 2020. They also included a 13th-century silver matrix used to imprint wax seals, with the name of a high-status medieval woman known as “Matilda de Cornhill”, and a hoard of 6,500 Roman coins.More from NewsCovid latest news: Having coronavirus in past six months leaves you \u0026#39relatively well protected\u0026#39 from omicronCovid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you as omicron cases riseCovid Plan B: How it will affect your Christmas plansReading fire: Man arrested on suspicion of murder and arson as \u0026#39number of people unaccounted for\u0026#39\u0026#39More than 300\u0026#39 trapped in Hong Kong skyscraper after fireMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"love great britain","story":"Of all the twists and turns that my life has taken over the last few years, one of the most truly upsetting and surreal was learning that I had been peremptorily disinvited from one of Britain\u0027s great universities.In 2018, when I last travelled to Britain, I met with several Cambridge professors and began to discuss the possibility of arranging a seminar there, focusing on some key Biblical texts. A formal offer of a Visiting Fellowship was proffered to me in February 2019, facilitated by Dr Douglas Hedley, Professor of the Philosophy of Religion at Clare College, and arranged through the necessary actions on the part of Cambridge and the University of Toronto. In the autumn of 2016, I had rented a 500-seat theater (on a whim, you might say) in Toronto, Canada, and delivered fifteen 90-minute public lectures entitled The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories. Surprisingly, all the lectures attracted a sold-out house. Furthermore, the majority of the audience consisted of young men, a notoriously difficult audience to attract to such things. The initial lecture, Introduction to the Idea of God, focused on the first two sentences of the Book of Genesis. Those who came to watch and listen walked their way with me through the remainder of that great book during the remaining fourteen.By the close of 2018, when initial arrangements were being made regarding my Fellowship, some four million people had watched the first lecture on YouTube, with a multitude more listening on my podcast. The series has now been viewed or watched forty million times. It has, in addition, attracted a widespread positive response from Christian Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox believers alike (even widespread positive critical response), as well as large swathes of the Orthodox Jewish and Islamic faithful. In a further unexpected twist, the lectures have also proved popular with those who regard themselves as explicitly atheistic.I recount this only to explain why the initial invitation from Cambridge was proffered: it has proved increasingly difficult for those concerned about our traditional and religious heritage to propagate their message — their ideas — to the modern community, and the success of my venture generated some great curiosity. After the success of the Genesis venture, I had the ambition to continue my investigations and discussion with the Book of Exodus. Knowing that I am an amateur in such matters (being possessed of no training in formal theology) I thought it would be prudent to test my knowledge and understanding in a setting that would challenge what I was assuming and potentially rectify my profound remaining ignorance. I therefore set out with my would-be Cambridge hosts to hear the opinions of those who had made the study of Divinity their central calling before I presumed to re-engage upon my lecture series. It was a great honour for me, and I say this most truly, to be offered this opportunity as a psychologist and an academic interloper. My invitation raised some hackles behind the scenes, however, based on what I would call a wilfully blind “misinterpretation” of my putative political views. In consequence, the invitation was unceremoniously rescinded, on an excuse which I later learned had been manufactured post-hoc. This happened, conveniently as well as treacherously, when Dr Hedley, my sponsor, was absent conducting his affairs in India. I discovered that I had been cancelled not as a formal notification, but accidentally, on Twitter. This, to say the least, was a shock. Earlier this year, however, I received an invitation to return. In the aftermath of my cancelling (and other too-similar incidents), an intense battle had been waged to make the sort of gratuitous forbidding that had been applied to me impossible. A group of Cambridge dons arose to challenge and reword a set of revisions to the university policy on free speech that would have, ironically — if that word is strong enough — made future similar cancellations both easier and more likely. Then they attempted to find twenty-five people who would affix their names to a petition that forced a full, anonymous and binding vote on the matter. This specific effort took months. People were afraid to sign afraid that making their support for such a change public would expose them to sanctions similar in consequence to those that befell me afraid that they would be mobbed and cancelled. But enough people eventually did so, and the matter was duly brought forward to Regent House, Cambridge’s ultimate governing body. And when the vote was called, an unusually large proportion of those eligible to cast their ballots turned out to make their opinions known. Almost nine out of ten of the fifteen-hundred or so who did so voted to make such cancellations impossible in the future — a larger margin of victory than any of the academics I spoke with about such issues of governance could recall. Obviously, something was transpiring of far broader significance than the mere revoking of my inidual fellowship offer. And, so, to the first of many reasons why I love Great Britain. Cambridge (like Oxford, from which it is descended, much as it dislikes to admit it) has a highly decentralised college structure. Both great institutions are more a loose collection of autonomous colleges, each with their own history, tradition, architecture, peculiarities of self-government, and educational aims. This arrangement allows for maximal liberty and creativity in thought and action at the most vitally important level — the local — while simultaneously enabling an optimal level of cross-college rivalry and cooperation.Furthermore, and most significantly, this free and loose organisational structure makes bureaucratic capture of the entire institutions extremely difficult. This, in turn, makes the rectification of mistakes, which will inevitably be made, possible and even likely. And that might just be the salvation of the rapidly-corrupting modern university, as well as everything downstream from that culture (and that is everything). And the rebellion at that august institution and elsewhere against the ideological forces currently threatening free discourse and inquiry in the academy is just beginning. Mark my words.My wife and I returned to Cambridge on November 17. I attended a number of seminars there, and delivered two public lectures (as I did a week later at Oxford, where I had also been invited to meet, speak and teach). I used these opportunities to discuss and test a proposition key to the body of thought I have been developing and communicating about for many decades: that we all perceive the world not as a set of self-evident objective material facts, but as a system of meaning, and that we do so by applying a framework which when described is a narrative: a story. I proposed further that this fact has profound — even revolutionary — implications for how we understand science and theology and for how we conceptualise ourselves, existentially, in the world. These ideas were markedly well received. I also had the great privilege of talking for several hours while at Oxford first to Sir Roger Penrose, perhaps the world’s most renowned living physicist, and then to Dr Richard Dawkins, who is rather uniquely a Fellow both of the original Royal Society (an honor bestowed upon outstanding scientists) and of the Royal Society of Literature, founded in 1820 by King George to “reward literary merit and excite literary talent.” Dr Dawkins is, as well, perhaps the world’s most famous and influential atheist. Dr Penrose and I (along with Dr Stephen Blackwood, who served as mediator) discussed his fascinating artistic proclivity for geometric tiling — an endeavour related, in my opinion, to the relationship between mapping a territory and the territory itself. I spoke with Dr Penrose mostly to inquire and to learn, as his knowledge roams far afield from mine, and was well-rewarded in my efforts, as our conversation literally ned the micro- and macro-cosmic realms. I spoke with Dr Dawkins (after long, tentative and increasingly amicable correspondence beforehand) to clarify my ignorance of his well-defended positions, particularly in relationship to his opposition to religious belief and behavior. Suffice it to say in the latter case that we have much more to talk about. I greatly enjoyed both opportunities and will be releasing a video recording of the former and an audio of the latter in the very near future.I believe that these conversations went very well. I certainly found them intensely engrossing and informative. And I regard it as another great privilege and opportunity to place them online, where they will be made available to millions of avid listeners around the world. I can do that because I am a free-speaking citizen of Canada, a member of the British Commonwealth and, except for our own sporadic and inexcusable foolishness, a country shaped to the core by the English Common Law tradition. Furthermore, I can make those discussions and all my talks and seminars at Oxbridge available on YouTube, the technologically-revolutionary platform invented by Americans who were even at the time of their revolution and are still now in some real sense sovereign British citizens, insisting on their due and intrinsic rights.And what would the world be without the recognition of those rights? A stifling web of intrigue a system of archaic dynasties a tribal mess of clans, steeped in nepotism, warring with one another for access to the short-term exigencies of power. I realise that there are other lights in the world, apart from the UK and its subsidiaries and once-dependents, although I would argue that even the European countries that profess respect for freedom of speech and thought (in reality, fealty to the ine word, both secular and inescapably religious) have done so in no small part because of the influence of that great land. And the fact that Dr Dawkins and I came armed, so to speak, with radically different viewpoints and conceptions was a spur to our very productive conversation, and not an impediment. And the fact that such discussions and their dissemination are possible throughout so much of the world (rather than positively forbidden and fatally dangerous) is another one of the reasons I love Great Britain.My talks at both Cambridge and Oxford appeared uniformly welcomed by faculty and students alike (with a single exception: a rather courageous and comic young woman, dressed in a full-body lobster suit, who popped in during my most public talk at Cambridge to shout “feminism” and dance briefly about). Why was that reception so positive, uniform, and manifold, when I was apparently ignorant and malevolent enough to be banned from the campus only two short years ago? The students at Cambridge remained seated when I entered the hall just prior to my first talk, although they had lined up down the block for most of the day beforehand, while the Oxford crowd, anxious as they are not to be outdone, gave me a (overwhelmingly moving) standing ovation before I spoke there.I say that not in triumph, I hope, as that would be the sort of pride that deservedly invites a fall, although I might need to confess occasionally harbouring at least a quizzical smile about such things. Such a public response seems at curious odds with the idea so invidiously insisted upon that I was and am a fundamentally malign person, characterised by literally unacceptable political opinions. The same mode of interaction made itself evident in what were many dozens of encounters with inidual students on the streets and in the colleges at Oxbridge: no fear, no disgust, no contempt, no hatred — just a series of extremely inviting, pleasant, and often surprisingly deep and intimate inidual encounters with fine mostly young people, striving with all due effort upward and onward, informing me forthrightly that they were doing so.  Perhaps an inquiring and curious journalist could discuss, among other issues, the fact of my fellowship revocation, the Regent House vote, and the positive response to my presence at Cambridge with the soon-to-depart Vice Chancellor (another Canadian — we are a pesky and intrusive lot), Prof Stephen Toope, whose precipitous retirement from the glorious UK academic and cultural scene was somewhat synchronistically timed, given the aforementioned vote and my subsequent re-invitation. Or, perhaps it could all be discussed with the tiny number of iniduals, still meddling madly and unrepentantly behind the scenes, who orchestrated the whole false thing in the beginning. And the fact that a journalist could inquire about such things is yet another reason why I love Great Britain, with its profound commitment to the idea that the curious have the right to interrogate and investigate those who have been granted authority or usurped power.After our university sojourn — after having been granted access to the original writings of Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton, after attending the most beautiful imaginable choir-accompanied services at the magnificent chapels gracing both institutions, after walking down the hallowed historical halls of higher learning in a setting constantly overwhelming and remarkable for a mere colonial, accustomed to history on a much more minor scale — my wife and I were privileged to tour the British Parliament, accompanied by one of the peers of the realm.And she was great, if I might be so bold to say so: everything a hopeful outsider uncorrupted by the pervasive cynicism that corrupts our time might have wished for — kind, charitable, engaging, unpretentious, articulate, elegant, and possessed of that wonderful accent, bestowing upon its possessor the immediate impression of high intelligence. In the Palace of Westminster I stopped for a moment at the precise centre of the heart of that remarkable building and lifted my eyes upward directly under the immense chandelier suspended under the beautiful and ornate domed octagonal ceiling. I perceived then that I was standing at the base of the realisation in stone, wood, and the air itself of the Cosmic Tree, Yggdrasil itself, the liana joining heaven and earth, the object of the most ancient of sacred visions and religious transports, the very lifeline between the skies that beckon forever above and the suffering and fallen ground we tread upon. If I could have asked for something more to befall me at that moment it would have been the music of the ine to accompany that vision, perhaps Bach’s great third Brandenburg Concerto, although I would have settled for the British national anthem, God Save the Queen. That lobby is most certainly not the untrustworthy, corrupt and damnable site of power, dominance and oppression, but the very place where the practical redemption of a great people is continually undertaken, governed by the transcendent and necessary principle of the unalienable right to express the Logos as conscience, soul and rationality itself dictate. That lobby, enshrined in that Palace — that cardinal Castle of the Word — has been a very light unto the world, concretised and embodied there simultaneously in stone, tradition and living action. It is the very place where the sovereign voice of the people meets the voice of its representatives, to be carried forth into its eventual incarnation into the body of laws we separately and jointly accept, adopt and act out. We are all carriers of the temptation to resentment and the desire to compel and force those who disagree with our presumptions that poses an eternal threat to the integrity of our souls and our societies. We are all possessed by the attributes of the Auschwitz capo — the Gulag trusty: the willingness to turn away and to consciously deceive, and the capacity to delight in oppression and cruelty. We are each and all of us tainted by the blood that soaks our soil.But the people of Great Britain have granted the world a gift whose power stands in permanent opposition to our most appalling proclivities as iniduals and societies. That gift is the political expression of the sanctification of the word — freedom in speech, imagination and thought: freedom to engage in the very process that builds and rebuilds habitable order itself from the chaos that eternally surrounds us. And that freedom is expressed in many ways, small and great, in the British Isles: in the wit of its people, in the effectiveness of its institutions, in the beauty of its art and literature, in the political and psychological presumptions that guide private discourse and public conception and action. And that is most particularly why I love Great Britain. And that is why, people of that realm (and not only of that realm), you should love her too, despite her sins, with your eyes lifted upward, your hope to the future, and the word of truth and faith on your tongues.I love your country.More from NewsCovid latest news: Having coronavirus in past six months leaves you \u0026#39relatively well protected\u0026#39 from omicronFull list of Tory rebels who opposed No 10\u0026#39s Covid pass planCovid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you as omicron cases riseCovid Plan B: How it will affect your Christmas plansReading fire: Man arrested on suspicion of murder and arson as \u0026#39number of people unaccounted for\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron less severe covid delta variant two vaccine jabs give","story":"Britain\u0027s omicron wave may be no worse than a flu pandemic, an expert has said, as the first major study into the new variant suggests it is less severe than delta.The first real-world study looking at 78,000 omicron cases in South Africa found the risk of hospitalisation is 29 per cent lower compared with the Wuhan strain, and 23 per cent lower than delta, with vaccines holding up well.Far fewer people have also needed intensive care from omicron, with just five per cent of cases admitted to ICU compared to 22 per cent of delta patients, the study shows.Professor Robert Dingwall, a government Covid adviser, from Nottingham Trent University, said it was clear from the South African data that panic was unjustified. Speaking in a personal capacity, Prof Dingwall said: “The omicron situation seems to be increasingly absurd. There is obviously a lot of snobbery about South African science and medicine but their top people are as good as any you would find in a more universally developed country.“They clearly don’t feel that the elite panic over here is justified, even allowing for the demographic differences in vulnerability – which are probably more than cancelled by the higher vaccination rate. My gut feeling is that omicron is very much like the sort of flu pandemic we planned for – a lot of sickness absence from work in a short period, which will create difficulties for public services and economic activity, but not of such a severity as to be a big problem for the NHS and the funeral business.”He offered his assessment as it emerged the Liberal Democrats leader, Labour shadow chancellor, Labour shadow transport secretary and Labour shadow education secretary have all tested positive for the virus.Daily reported cases rose to 59,610, an increase of 12.1 per cent in the past week. However, the number of tests carried out has risen 12.4 per cent in the same period, and the percentage of people testing positive is relatively stable at around 10 per cent. The data from South Africa, which was compiled by Discovery Health, its largest private health insurer, and the South Africa Medical Research Council (SAMRC), found that although there were high numbers of breakthrough infections in people who had been vaccinated, cases appeared to be less severe, and this was backed up by anecdotal evidence from doctors on the ground.They found that effectiveness against infection dropped from 80 per cent to 33 per cent but offered 70 per cent protection against hospital admissions, and this was maintained across age groups and chronic conditions. At the time of the study there had been no deaths.Professor Glenda Geray, of SAMRC, said: “It’s very heartening to see these results and release that vaccine effectiveness is still greater than 50 per cent. So it’s encouraging and again – the booster strategy may also mitigate the reduction in vaccine effectiveness.“I think it’s too early for us to make that call but we can say that prior infection and vaccination are affecting the reduction of admission and serious illness. And we’re seeing a shorter duration in hospitalisation.“People who have been vaccinated are staying in hospital just 2.4 days.”The study also showed that the odds of reinfection were lower than during delta, suggesting that people who had a delta infection may be better protected.The researchers said that although excess natural deaths had increased in South Africa in recent weeks, they were still significantly lower than during previous waves. Ryan Noach, chief executive of Discovery Health, said: “You can see clearly that in omicron, the adult population has a 29 per cent lower risk of admission.If you look at the proportion of patients admitted to high care in ICU for severe illness, across the first three waves, the proportion of patients in high care and ICU collectively goes up to 35 per cent, whereas in this omicron period, it is only about 13 per cent.“The data is correlating with the anecdotal feedback.

However, the dean’s supporters claim that this loophole is being “exploited” in a bid to remove him.The mental incapacitation clause was added in a redraft of the college\u0027s statute in 2011, but a bylaw dating from August 2021 enabled other members of the governing body - not just the dean - to initiate action on medical grounds.One supporter, who is close to the case and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “Everyone in Oxford knows what this is about. A few people on the Christ Church governing body are determined to get rid of their dean at any cost.“They are frustrated because the Charity Commission is not prepared to let them spend vast amounts on a trumped-up tribunal. So now they are trying to declare that he is mad. I can assure you that Martyn Percy is not mad.“Anyone who has been to one of his recent lectures or read his recent book will know that he has one of the sharpest minds in academia.”The college has admitted that to date it has spent more than £1million in legal and PR costs in its 2019 attempt to oust the dean. However, the final figure is expected to be far higher.According to the summons document, Prof Lindsay Judson, the senior ex-censor and philosophy tutor, has “considered the matter very carefully and having taken legal and medical advice”, has concluded that “the dean’s condition or any mental or physical quality affecting him is such as substantially to interfere with the performance of his duties”.As a result, he is “obliged to consider the removal of the dean” in accordance with college statutes, and that “the dean’s removal on medical grounds should be considered and therefore that the case should be forwarded to a medical board”.Prof Judson, who signed off the summons, has been involved in previous proceedings regarding the dean. However, the document states that the professor “does not believe that he has a conflict of interest” in any part of the process.It also sets out that a special meeting of the governing body will be convened to consider the matter regarding the dean, and that one of its members - who “shall have some experience of the mental or physical incapacity apparently affecting” him - will be nominated to sit on a board.The governing body will also get to decide upon the two medically-qualified people to act as chairmen of the board.In contrast, the dean will only be allowed to nominate one person to sit on this board to decide whether or not he is mentally incapacitated. However, if he fails to nominate someone “reasonably expeditiously”, Prof Judson will nominate someone for him.The second ongoing tribunal is the latest effort to force out the dean, and follows an alleged incident of sexual harassment in Christ Church Cathedral in October.Thames Valley Police said it had conducted a thorough investigation into the matter at the time, adding: Our investigation has now concluded and the matter has been filed pending further information coming to light.However, the college set up its own internal probe into the incident and is now preparing to use it as the basis to remove him from his post.Allies of the dean claimed it is certainly not a safeguarding issue but part of a long-running persecution of him by other senior dons which has become a vendetta .When approached for comment, a spokesperson for the college said that there were “serious inaccuracies” in the claims. However, they refused to clarify what the inaccuracies were.The spokesperson added: “You will understand that we have a duty of care to the dean as we do with all staff and students at Christ Church, and so we are unable to make any comment on what is a sensitive HR matter.”More from NewsCovid latest news: Having coronavirus in past six months leaves you \u0026#39relatively well protected\u0026#39 from omicronFull list of Tory rebels who opposed No 10\u0026#39s Covid pass planCovid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you as omicron cases riseCovid Plan B: How it will affect your Christmas plansReading fire: Man arrested on suspicion of murder and arson as \u0026#39number of people unaccounted for\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbcs younger journalists do not understand impartiality former","story":"Younger journalists do not understand impartiality and confuse it with “social justice”, former BBC editors have warned.A generation that has grown up with social media believes that being impartial and saying what they think is right are the same things.Giving evidence to a House of Lords committee, Roger Mosey, the former head of BBC Television News, said: “Some younger journalists don’t understand it in the way it was classically imbued into BBC journalists over the years.”Richard Sambrook, former head of newsgathering at the corporation, is now a professor of journalism and said his students don’t see impartiality in the same way that older generations do.“I talked to students about impartiality… and they may say, ‘Well, fairness is about social justice.’ You have to try to reframe the argument. With identity politics, they have a very different concept of what is right,” he said.“We’re in a culture of calling things out. They are a generation who do not see it in quite the same way.”Sarah Sands, the former editor of Radio 4’s Today programme, said the BBC’s culture of turning news presenters into celebrities could be a threat to impartiality.She told the committee: The BBC is built on this fault line between public service news and entertainment - both valid, but there is a conflict as the BBC makes different demands on its presenters to be warmer, more accessible, to reveal more of themselves.“You have to be slightly careful of that line, and that’s when it gets into things like social media, because the point of social media is to win personal popularity and that starts to distort the way you behave.”She praised Lyse Doucet, the BBC’s chief international correspondent, as an example of a journalist who has spent a career reporting from the world’s troublespots.But she said the corporation placed more importance on news presenters who can branch out into entertainment.“To me, reporting is the noblest of all journalistic trades and I was always sorry that there was this hierarchy that a reporter is good, a presenter is better, and a presenter who could get onto Strictly is the tops.“That seems to be a pity because, actually, I think there is something rather marvellous about that sober, factual reporting,” Sands said.BBC journalists who have appeared on Strictly include Dan Walker, recently voted out of this year’s series, and Naga Munchetty, who appeared in the 2016 show.More from NewsCovid latest news: Having coronavirus in past six months leaves you \u0026#39relatively well protected\u0026#39 from omicronCovid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you as omicron cases riseCovid Plan B: How it will affect your Christmas plansReading fire: Man arrested on suspicion of murder and arson as \u0026#39number of people unaccounted for\u0026#39\u0026#39More than 300\u0026#39 trapped in Hong Kong skyscraper after fireMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"closing schools would carry heavy political price","story":"Consequently, there was strong public support for quite radical “catch-up” policies from the Department for Education – for example, to extend the school day and to provide free hours for students with academic tutors.Furthermore, polling we conducted in February 2021 on mental health revealed a similar picture of deep parental and public concern. Nearly a third of parents of children under-18 said they were worried about their children’s mental health – and parents said they were badly struggling managing home schooling and their working lives. Home schooling mostly fell upon mothers, with women reporting much greater stress levels than men.For parents across the country, the relief of children going back to the classroom was extreme. Parents saw their children revert to their happy selves and the burden of home schooling was lifted they will be desperate to avoid a return to those terrible weeks.Second, the economy has deteriorated. Home schooling destroys productivity and, for many, especially the self-employed, wipes out their earnings. Since schools were last closed, the Government has announced higher taxes, and bills have risen amid new inflationary pressures. Home schooling children was stressful enough a year ago this time, many parents are going to be wondering how they will make ends meet while logging on to Zoom lessons.Third, we are in a post-vaccination environment. A year ago, people bought the need for school closures to some extent because nobody had been vaccinated – and the prospect of new vaccines gave everyone hope that these closures would be a temporary one-off. This time, most of the country has been vaccinated but we seem to be heading back to square one. People will be wondering whether this is going to be an annual occurrence there will be a great deal more weariness among parents and the public.More from NewsCovid latest news: Having coronavirus in past six months leaves you \u0026#39relatively well protected\u0026#39 from omicronFull list of Tory rebels who opposed No 10\u0026#39s Covid pass planCovid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you as omicron cases riseCovid Plan B: How it will affect your Christmas plansReading fire: Man arrested on suspicion of murder and arson as \u0026#39number of people unaccounted for\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wednesday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"In the end, the rebellion was more devastating than had been predicted.

Led by Keir Starmer, Labour looked like an alternative government in the making as they voted to save the Covid Plan B safety measures, even as Johnson’s reign crumbles. Two years after securing an -seat majority, the writing’s clearly on the wall for Johnson. His looming demise will make him more desperate than ever to cling on North Shropshire, a Tory citadel, in tomorrow’s by-election. Britain’s tragedy is to have in Downing Street during a cataclysmic pandemic, with a new virus mutation rampant, the worst Prime Minister this side of the Second World War.

Evenbooster jabs are found to be effective against Omicron, they projected a wave of infection which could lead to a peak of more than , daily hospital admissions.MPs are due to vote on Plan B restrictions in the Commons later, with Boris Johnson facing a major Tory revolt over plans for Covid passports for nightclubs and large events. It comes after Mr Johnson warned his Cabinet “a huge spike of Omicron was coming” and said a model claiming , people got infected with the iant yesterday was “valid”. Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty also reportedly told the Cabinet that pubs, shops and restaurants could be forced to shut in January due to staff shortages caused by Omicron. Dr Hopkins was grilled about the need for restrictions by the Commons Science and Technology Committee. Asked by Tory Committee chair Greg Clark on the exit strategy from Covid curbs, she said: This is our fourth time going into something like this.The waves last a period of time and the more the restrictions are effective, then the smaller the peak, and therefore you can reduce andle to normal. She said boosting the population was likely to reduce hospitalisations - and limit the strain on the NHS.Asked when restrictions could be lted based on the modelling so far, she said: So I think thatthe modelling that the London School has done [is right], I would expect that there is going to be needing some level of restrictions in place for the next four to eight weeks.” It came as Downing Street today refused again to rule out bringing in new restrictions before Christmas. Whitehall officials have reportedly been drawing up tighter curbs for England - that could include limiting pubs and restaurants to outdoor dining. They could even be forced to shut their doors entirelyit means people can see their families at Christmas. The PM’s spokesman insisted Plan B measures - which stop short of restrictions on pubs - “were balanced and proportionate”. But he refused to rule out further restrictions, calling them speculation and hypothetical”, and saying only that there weren’t “plans” to bring them in.  Asked about reports furlough could be brought backpubs have to shut, he replied: “I’m not going to get into hypotheticals - no plans.” And he refused to rule out bringing in restrictions while MPs are on their Christmas break. The spokesman said: “What we are saying is we want to introduce the measures as set out in Plan B, which will help reduce transmission whilst we get more boosters in arms, which is the biggest single action we can take. “As I’ve said on a number of occasions, we need to learn more about this iant on things like severity before we decide what,any, action is required in the future.” He added: “Obviously we will always want to ensure Parliament will have its say, should there be any requirements to make changes. “In extremis, as the public would expect, we have the ability in the interests of public health to make changes.” Askedchanges could be made while MPs are on recess he replied: “It would depend on the circumstances.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It shows  people crowded together - in blatant breach of lockdown rules - in a medium-sized room in the party’s Westminster HQ.Some of the group are shown wearing paper hats while one is sporting a House of Commons Christmas jumper.The event, organised by top Tory Shaun Bailey ’s mayoral campaign, took place on December  last year when London was in Tier .After he was approached by the Mirror tonight, Mr Bailey dramatically quit as chair of the London Assembly’s police and crime committee.  The image also shows several guests - including billionaire Tory donor Nick Candy - raising glasses of wine while a catered buffet features prominently. One of the revellers was a senior figure on Boris Johnsonaposs leadership election campaign. It emerged last week that Tory staff danced and drank wine late into the night and revellers damaged a door at what was described as a “raucous” event. At the time, the capital was in Tier  restrictions which banned any social mixing between households indoors.The party took place the day before the No  festive quiz, where Boris Johnson was pictured as quizmaster, and four days ahead of the Downing Street Christmas bash.Hours before the party then health secretary Matt Hancock announced that the capital would move into tougher Tier  restrictions. Tory insiders suggested tonight that party chairman Oliver Dowden was appalled by the photograph of the festive event. The Conservatives have said that “formal disciplinary action” had been taken against four CCHQ staff seconded to the campaign. A spokesman said: “Senior CCHQ staff became aware of an unauthorised social gathering in the basement of [CCHQ] organised by the Bailey campaign on the evening of th December. “Formal disciplinary action was taken against the four CCHQ staff who were seconded to the Bailey campaign.” Scotland Yard has until now refused to investigate the Christmas gatherings citing a lack of evidence.  Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “This is damning new evidence of a party, with a buffet, drinks, Christmas attire and absolutely no social distancing held at Conservative Party HQ.“Shaun Bailey is an elected official that is clearly breaking Covid regulations in this photo and encouraging the same of his staff. “Whilst everyone  was making sacrices to keep their community safe, the chair of the Police and Crime committee in the Greater London Authority was partying. “His position as chair was untenable and he knew that.” Mr Bailey, who does not drink alcohol, is said to have left the party early in the evening, shortly after the picture was taken. A Shaun Bailey campaign spokesperson said: “On the evening of  December , at the end of the working day, the campaign hosted a post-work event to thank campaign staff for their efforts over the course of they year. “This was a serious error of judgement and we fully accept that gathering like this as that time was wrong and apologise unreservedly”. A spokesperson for Mr Candy said: “Nick Candy attended the office of the Shaun Bailey campaign for an end of year review on  December .He gave a short thank you speech to the team and spent some time with Shaun Bailey to discuss campaign matters before leaving shortly afterwards.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyGreater London AuthorityShaun BaileyBoris JohnsonCrimePoliticsCoronavirusDowning Street Christmas PartyTory Government\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Caresaid the -minute wait time is likely to cause more harm than it averts. It said: The Chief Medical Officersof the UK and lead Deputy Chief Medical Officersfor vaccines have considered whether, in the light of the very considerable need to speed up vaccination and boosting in response to Omicron iant, the -minute wait for some mRNA Covid- vaccines should be suspended.  Their view, having considered the views of the Covid- Vaccine Benefit-Risk Expert Working Group , NHS planners and others is that with the low rates of anaphylaxis, in the context of the considerable need for people to be boosted or vaccinated, the -minute wait after a vaccination with mRNA vaccine will cause more harm than it can avert because it will signicantly reduce the number of people who can be vaccinated over a short period of time.The -minute wait should therefore be suspended for first, second and homologous or heterologous boost vaccinations with mRNA vaccine given the current situation, with this operationalised in line with the needs in each of the four nations.  It comes as Boris Johnson accepted a shock model suggesting , people were infected with Omicron yesterday and warned ministers a huge spike is coming. There have been long queues at walk-in vaccine centres as people rush to get their booster jabs before Christmas, while there have also been virtual queues as people try to access the booking system via the NHS website. The DHSC statement added: The CMOs recognise that this will lead to a marginal increase in risk for a very small number of people, but substantially fewer than would be harmed by a slower vaccine rollout in the current public health emergency leading to some citizens not getting boosted or vaccinated prior to exposure to Omicron.This includes a consideration that any prior vaccination and particularly boosting is likely to lessen the likelihood of severe disease arising from Omicron iant infection.  The Prime Minister held a virtual Cabinet meeting for the first time in months in light of the increasing number of Covid cases. Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty told ministers to expect a signicant increase in hospitalisations as cases rise, but it was too early to say how severe Omicron was, No said. Prof Whitty warned people could have to be turned away from hospitals by mid-January as a Covid wave engulfs hospital staff.  The UK Health Security Agencyhas estimated that the new iant was infecting , people a day as of yesterday. The shock figure is much higher than the recorded cases, which officials say is due to the speed at which the strain spreads and the delay in cases being picked up in official tests. Itaposs understood the , figure is only the mid range of modelling - so it could be even higher. With cases doubling every two to three days, it could theoretically lead to a million infections a day by next week.

No double meaning to Secret Santa this time, then.However, in one important way, this festive season is so far considerably worse than last, because back then we pretty much knew where we stood. It was going to be terrible – the end.This year, the present no one wanted: a massive heap of uncertainty. Oh Omicron, you shouldn’t have.It’s yet another twist on the Corona-coaster. Today is December ... crunch time. If you get infected from now on, your -day isolation will mean no Christmas for you. And perhaps a ripple effect of scrambled plans for othersyou are were meant to be hosting. So what to do  Or rather, what not to  Because while there will be some who no longer pay attention to a word that comes out of the Prime Minister’s mouth regarding restrictions, I believe they will be the minority. We can all see where they’re coming from, relate to their fury, but the reason I wear a mask is not because Boris Johnson told me to. It’s because it’s clearly necessary. One of the jigsaw pieces that will mean this is over faster, and we can start to put ourselves back together again. Most people want to do – will do – the right thing. The problem at the moment is that it’s very dficult to know what that is.Should we be going to our office Christmas parties while we’re working from home  Attending football matches, and other big, potentially superspreading sporting events like the World Darts Championship at Alexandra Palace  Popping round to the neighbours for mince pies  Having drinks with friends  Going to carol services, or even our kids’ nativity plays  In fact, should we be sending our children to school at all, seeing as there are outbreaks in most of them now  Omicron’s timing is perfect for messing our lives up as much as possible – close enough to Christmas to put an enormous question mark of doom over it, but not so early that the experts working round the clock know enough to make a final judgement. Make no mistake – we are very much on our own here. We’re going to have to work out the rules for ourselves. These rules will, presumably, y between us, just as our approaches to Covid have throughout the pandemic, from one extreme to another the cautious to the caution-to-the-wind-ers, and everyone  on the spectrum in-between. Now you have to hope your thinking matches up with anyone you were planning to see, and also try not to worry about the implications of mixing with people whose strategies have opposed yours up until now. Will you only spend Christmas with people who’ve had their booster  Insist on aclause that it must have been two weeks ago, so it’s kicked in  Make negative tests a condition of entry Maybe you’re tempted to admit defeat and cancel the whole thing, focus on having a great one next year instead… just like we did last year.The bitter reality is that we desperately need this Christmas to be exactly what it now cannot be – simple, peaceful, normal .Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineBoris JohnsonOmicron iantChristmasChristmas DayChristmas partyTory Government\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said ministers wanted people to be sensible but to enjoy their Christmas.Plan B measures - which were approved last night despite a massive Tory revolt - should last through to the New Year, he said.But he said Parliament could be recalledfurther Covid restrictions are needed over the Christmas recess. It comes as one of the Governmentaposs experts advisers warned that Covid hospital admissions could reach , a day - and there was a very real possibility of hospitals being overwhelmed.  SPI-M expert Professor Graham Medley said Omicron infections were increasing quite dramatically and were already likely at January levels.Shock modelling suggested that infections were running at , infections a day, which is understood to have been raised at Cabinet yesterday by Health Secretary Sajid Javid.Itaposs understood the figure is only the mid range of modelling - so it could be even higher. Privately, officials have not ruled out further restrictions to deal with the iant. Mr Shapps insisted that people should be able to enjoy the festive season - but then made it clear that restrictions could still be looming. We want people to be able to enjoy Christmas this year. We are certainly in a better position than we were this time last year. We want people to be sensible but to enjoy their Christmas, he told Sky News. I think that, with some confidence, that we can say that people are going to be able to enjoy their Christmas get-together with their friends and families with only what has already been . But he later said that Parliament will be recalledfurther Covid restrictions are required during the Christmas recess.We have got in place now the measures that we believe will see us through to the new year, Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast.If we did need to do anything , Parliament would be recalled too in order to vote on doing that, so it wonapost just be an automated thing. We want people to be able enjoy Christmas this year. We are definitely in a better position than we were last year. But Prof Medley, an expert in infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said Covid infections are now at the level seen at the start of the year and are set to go beyond that in the coming months. He told the Today programme: The numbers of infections with Omicron is increasing and has been increasing quite dramatically. Weaposre probably now at the level that we have been in the past, back in January, and it does look as though itaposs going to continue beyond that and go over it. He said people were inidually at lower risk due to mass vaccination and greater immunity but the risk to the population were greaterpeople end up in hospital in large numbers. Prof Medley added:think it is a very real possibility thatthe numbers of infections increasing continues in the way that it has done and it spills out into older age groups than we could see the number of people being omitted to hospital getting very large and certainly going over the thousand, maybe up to , a day.

Thomas Kielinger, , is explaining why he thinks many Europeans regret Brexit. “It’s about the UK’s soft power,” says the Polish-born German who lives in London. “The language, pop culture, music, history, Shakespeare. That’s the predominant reason why Germans are so unhappy about Brexit, because they love Britain sometimes more than Brexiteers love Britain.” To join, see mirror europetalks  Entrepreneur and Brexiteer Saadia Baber, , of High Wycombe, Bucks, disagrees. “Just because I’m not in the EU, I am still part of Europe. We should be proud of the common human values we have.” The chat, hosted by the Goethe Institut in London, was screened to thousands of people across  countries. We discussed topics such as homelessness, EU migrants, sovereignty, empty shelves, flag-waving, imperialism and busking. Fortunately, nobody stormed off the seat and sent us all flying. And towards the end, even vehemently opposed Brexiteers and Remainers found a little common ground.“A lot of us have described ourselves as patriotic and loving our country,” said -year-old Labour councillor Jon-Conor Lyons, from Manchester.“I certainly want to believe in our country and I love Britain. I identy as a Manc, a Briton and a European.” View the full -minute video of the conversation on Vimeo Gosia Cabaj said the UK leaving the EU might have benefited Europe in one way, as it convinced many of her fellow Poles to stay in. Thomas said: “Now you are out of the EU, you only have yourself to blamethings don’t succeed.” Ada Pratt, a retired nursing sister from Rochdale who voted Leave, concluded with: “I think in general, everyone should stop blaming everybody  and talk to one another.” Ada, Jon-Conor, Saadia and Gosia were joined on Seat # by academic Ananya Jahanara Kabir, , Cambridge student Jovan Nepaul, , hotel worker Gisella Sobarasua, , from Nottingham, The New European journalist John Kampfner, and Express political editor David Maddox.  The debate was hosted by the Mirror and the Goethe Institut’s Katharina von Ruckteschell-Katte and screened in a live broadcast from Warsaw, Madrid, Berlin and London to celebrate this year’s Europe Talks. Over the last few weeks, , people, including , from the UK have been matched with people from dferent European countries for a videocall chat. Here are some of the people who met, and how they got on. Michael Bailey and Joan Willson When Brexiteer grandma Joan Willson met Michael Bailey - a former British citizen now living in Austria - the conversation quickly turned to Covid jabs and migration. Speaking at home in Camarthen, west Wales, Joan, , says: “You’re in the luckier spot in Austria – here in Wales, it is a total, utter disaster. We can’t see a doctor and I had a nightmare to get my booster.” Michael, , a translator, says: “I got my two jabs within five weeks of each other and I was literally able to walk in to get my booster.” He asks: “Would it worry youI said I am an immigrant in Austria ”  Joan, who lived in South Africa with her late husband, says: “I have no problem with that, we migrated to South Africa for a better le. We voted for the Conservatives because they had a promise that they would control immigration, but they haven’t. We don’t have jobs for our young people.” Michael says he “begs to dfer” and has helped an Afghan man who “has been through hell”. Angela Gash and Semra Gyokche When Angela Gash, , met Semra Gyokche, , an accountant living in Kardzhali, Bulgaria, she was pleased by Semra’s liberal attitudes. Accountant Angela, from Highbury, North London, said: “The general feeling we have been given about Eastern Europeans is that they can be homophobic and racist.  “I was so happy to see your responses.” Semra, who has gay friends, says, “Everyone is entitled to express themselves as they wish.” Angela went on: “% of us do want to be part of Europe. When we found out we were leaving Europe, I cried.” Semra agrees, adding. “When I came to the UK for a holiday, a lady said to us, ‘we don’t want the Romanians and Bulgarians here.” “I am so sorry you experienced that,” says Angela. Rich O’Mara and Maybritt Langewand Lockdown, the environment and languages were talking points when Rich O’Mara, , chatted to German student Maybritt Langewand, . Living in Wilmslow, Cheshire, with his we and kids, pilot Rich has been to Germany about  times but has struggled to learn the native tongue. He is due to make his first flight in two years and Madrid-based Maybritt has also been hit by the lockdown. The multi-linguist reveals: “University continued online but my mum suffered because we live off tourism. “I worry about our environment”. Rich says: “To be able to fly across Europe for £ is just wrong. There should be a minimum price that reflects its carbon cost.” Maybritt adds: “If you just raise the price, fewer people will use it, but you just exclude people who can’t pay.” Maria Hearl and Sevda Pumova Retired headteacher and vicar Maria Hearl has had pen pals since she was a teenager and jumped at the chance to update the tradition. When she joined a videocall with Sevda Pumova, an accountant, from Pleven, Bulgaria, their conversation came easily. Now they plan to keep in touch with fortnightly Zoom calls. Maria, who lives with her husband in Tiverton, Devon, loves travelling and when she reveals she’s visited Bulgaria, Sevda is impressed. The keen linguist says: “I’ve stayed not very far from where she lives and I’ve got a few phrases in Bulgarian. “The day we left Europe was the worst day of my le.” Sevda, , adds: “I love talking to Maria, she is very opinionated on most things. On most of it we found we have the same position.” Eddy Canfor-Dumas and Sigrid Korner Le after Brexit was the major topic of conversation when Brit Eddy Canfor-Duman got together with Sigrid Korner, , a university lecturer from Frankfurt, Germany, “There is a growing regret, people were lied to,” Eddy says. “There were two Leave campaigns. Farage and co, he appealed to a xenophobic, Little Britain. Then there was the libertarian side that talked about democracy and trade deals.” The -year-old writer from near Watford, adds: “There’s going to be huge buyers’ remorse.” “We were disappointed,” says Sigrid. “We were hoping until the last moment you would remain.” How both countries welcome migrants is another discussion with Sigrid feeling it’s positive although the “German reserve” means the people don’t mingle and stay in their own communities. Eddy adds: “My experience of Germany has been that it’s a much more tolerant society than Britain.” The pair agree to stay in touch.

Martin Gilbert hit out after travelling on the packed service after his Avanti train from Rugby to Liverpool Lime Street had been cancelled.The -year-old shared footage of the service after having to catch a West Midlands train and change at Crewe, the Liverpool Echo reports.Retired train driver Martin was shocked when he boarded the connection as it was extremely crowded, and many passengers were not wearing masks - despite new restrictions coming in. The video shows that the carriage was full, with all of the seats taken and passengers standing in the aisles. Many people can be seen not wearing a face covering, which are now mandatory on public transport unless people are exempt. West Midlands Trains bosses have described the images of people without masks as disappointing. Martin told the Echo the service from Crewe was very busy due to the Liverpool FC match at Anfield against Aston Villa on Saturday and due to cancellations. He claims despite the train being full, it still stopped at every station from Crewe to Lime Street and people still tried squeezing on the train, with many not wearing masks. Martin said: It was like a Japanese rush hour train where you had to push people on and they were still stopping at all the stations going to Liverpool and people were trying to get on, it was unbelievable. People couldnapost get on and they were squeezing to get on the train and people werenapost wearing masks thataposs the thing. The retired train driver said the journey was so uncomfortable due to it being full and many people not adhering to face covering rules.  He added: Weaposre in an age of covid where we are trying to self distance and it was so uncomfortable. It was like a covid express train and people were still trying to get on the train, even at the next station at Acton Bridge and further along the line. Face masks had already been made compulsory in environments such as shops and public transport on November .On Friday, December , Boris Johnson made this a requirement in more venues.The UK Covid- threat level also increased to Level  due to the spread of the Omicron covid iant. This means transmission of covid is high or rising exponentially. In an address to the nation on Sunday night, the Prime Minister urged everyone eligible to get boosted now, as the Omicron strain of the virus spreads in the UK. He claimed everybody aged  and over will have the chance to get their booster before the New Year, bringing the previous target of boosting all adults by the end of January forward by an entire month. Speaking on Sunday night, he also urged people to not make the mistake of thinking Omicron canapost hurt you. The PM added: At this point our scientists cannot sayit is any less severe, and eventhat were true a wave of Omicron... could lead to many deaths. A spokesperson for West Midlands Trains said: “Face coverings are once again, mandatory on all public transport, unless you have an exemption. It is disappointing when those who can choose not to wear a face covering which serves to protect everyone on the train.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Public transportCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When you get older, your scribbles as a child hold a lot of sentimentality - and one doting dad found the perfect way to preserve them. James Dickinson, , decided to have the drawings inked onto his leg - in order to immortalise it forever. He visited the tattoo studio Northside Tattooz, in Newcastle Upon Tyne armed with a carefully chosen selection of drawings - and artist Kara Chambers artfully brought it to le. He chose a drawing of Ariel, from The Little Mermaid, drawn by niece Evelyn, seven, followed by a pic of The Incredible Hulk, done by Nephew Oliver, five, and Lord Voldermort, of Harry Potter fame, by his own son Ashlan, seven.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Tattoo artist James, who runs Tattoos at Pins and Needles, Newcastle, said: “There were three children who did the drawings. The Little Mermaid one was done by my niece a few years ago which I’ve been saying all that time I wanted to get tattooed. “My nephew did the Hulk one and my son did the Voldemort one this year because he wanted to put one of his drawings up in my tattoo booth amongst my drawings for the customers so they could see it. It just seemed a better idea than getting names they are s**t hot little drawings they’ve done, and I thought that theyaposd make for a badass tattoo. “I felt really good at the sitting. Me and Kara are friends and I trusted her completely to put her artistic spin onto the drawings the kids have done. She is an insanely talented artist, and I gave her free rein to do what she wanted with the background. “I couldn’t have got a better person to do it I knew she would smash out the park, but she went way beyond that. “People’s reactions are between utter disbelief and can’t believe she translated it that well into a tattoo. Kara got the colours so bang on and made it look like the true kidsapos drawings came to le on my leg. “All the kids love it. They don’t fully understand that it’s permanent at their age. They just see it as I’ve got a drawing they’ve done on my leg. “When they’re older they’ll fully grasp it, taking in the meaning behind it more I’m sure.” Proud artist Kara, , from Newbiggan, who works at Northside Tattooz, added: “I was absolutely chuffed with the tattoo when it was finished. James sat amazingly well for the size we ended up going for, especially inside the knee area. “I was of course tired and hungry and fancied a beer at the end, but was so privileged he picked me and trusted me so much with something so sentimental. I was dying of the pressure inside, but have to play it cool.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Harry PotterTattoos\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Almost all of us will be tucking into a selection box of choccies this festive season, and while every family have their favourite brand, the big four remain the same - Heroes, Quality Street, Roses, and Celebrations. But for those of us old enough to remember the ious chocolates that used to be in each of the selections, chomping on the newer line-ups just doesn’t feel the same. Whether it’s the white chocolate Dream bars that used to be in Heroes boxes, the coffee cremes from Roses, or my personal favourite, the Galaxy truffles that were removed from Celebrations – we all have that one flavour we just can’t get our hands on anymore. Surrey Live has compiled a list of all  flavours of chocolate that have been removed from the big four selection boxes over the years – but which one will you be missing the most this Christmas Quality Street Tins of Quality Street have been around since , and with an impressive -year history, it’s unsurprising the chocolates included in the box have changed.

The Omicron iant today becoming the dominant iant in London, and the government has introduced a raft of new measures in an attempt to curb the spread of the iant, including introducing daily testing for everyone who has come into contact with a positive case.The first UK cases of Omicron were only confirmed on November  and the speed of its spread has alarmed ministers and prompted a dramatic acceleration of the booster jab programme. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror  The UK Health Security Agency has previously projected that Omicron could become the dominant iant across the country by the middle of the month. So far one person is confirmed to have died from the Omicron iant - but their age or vaccination status isnapost known.The ZOE Covid app, which logs submissions from millions of users across the UK, has begun to hint at the iantaposs ability to evade vaccine-induced antibodies, the Express reports.Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London, who heads up the ZOE Covid study app, explained the symptoms being reported in those double or triple jabbed. A regular ZOE user entertained a th birthday party gathering with  guests, he told Good Morning Britain. All of them had taken lateral flow tests prior to the gathering. On Sunday they were informed that one of the guests - who happened to be a teacher - had tested positive and the following week  out of  had fallen ill in some way.  They were subsequently informed by NHS test and trace that it was Omicron or probable Omicron and they were waiting to get the genetic sequencing confirmations. According to the professor, the symptoms they reported were pretty mild.Quite a few of them had nausea, slight temperature, sore throats and headaches, he said.Although nobody was bad enough to need a doctor or go to hospital, all had been double and triple vaccinated, added Prof Spector. The fact that none of the cases required medical assistance indicates that the vaccines clearly reduced the severity of the illness, he noted. It now appears the current wave will result in a far higher peak amid warnings that Omicron cases could reach as high as one million a day. NHS England have scrapped the -minute wait for patients after theyaposve have their Pfizer Covid jabbed to speed up the booster programme.They have done away with the quarter-of-an-hour sit-down so more doses can be administered.  The isolation rules have also changed, with those who have come into contact with a positive case expected to do a daily lateral flow test. But todayaposs stats arrive after it emerged no PCR Covid test slots are left in areas of England today.Hertfordshire, Suffolk, the Isle of Wight, Bristol, and Mendip currently have no PCR tests - the gold standard of coronavirus tests - available to the general public at walk-in and drive-in test sites.The governments booking site previously said there are none available at every region in England while some slots are still available at sites in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The site has since been updated with most areas having slots available again.Meanwhile, a decision on whether to vaccinate children as young as five could come in the next  days, the head of the UKaposs vaccine advisory group has said.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The bathroom of the Hardysapos three-bedroom house has been locked off since the start of November, when waves of poo and sewer waste started bursting up through the toilet into their property. In addition to the sewage, the home is infested with rodents that gnaw through their kitchen cupboards and also poo everywhere. Concerned dad Sam, , says his young children, aged between one and nine, are becoming chronically ill with sickness and diarrhoea. He is also anxious about his -week pregnant partner Rachel, and the health of his unborn seventh child. Mum Rachel says the family havenapost been able to shower or bathe for six weeks. She said the council promised a fix on Friday, but that nothing was resolved and my kids have to without a wash even longer. The council has since said it has visited the property and it was awaiting confirmation the drain had been unblocked. Rachel told The Sun : They just donapost care about us, they see us as scum, but we are desperate.My kids deserve better and shouldnapost have to live like this, and Sam and I constantly feel stressed and depressed. With no other options, the couple have had to fill up a small bath, which is designed for babies, with a kettle in order to wash the kids and themselves. For four hours yesterday, they plunged their bare hands into the drain to unblock it, because a maintenance worker failed to do so, they claim. When itaposs time to wash in the tiny makesht bath, Rachel lays blankets on the kitchen floor, but says the family shouldnapost have to do so in the modern age. A nine-year-old should not be washing in a baby bath. This is , not , she adds. Sam claims the council are refusing to help the family, and heaposs had enough of dealing with them.Sam, from Southsea in Portsmouth, Hampshire, said: My kids shouldnapost have to live like this.The sewage is squirting out from the downstairs toilet all over the floor. Every time we use the shower or flush the toilet upstairs, the toilet downstairs will start filling up and sewage will start spewing over and coming out of dferent pipes. Sam says there is an outdoor drain thataposs also blocked and leaking sewage. On top of having to constantly clear the home and garden of fecal matter and toilet roll, the home is also infested with mice. Every single night the couple wake up to find the mice have plundered the kitchen, and nibbled through the cupboards and shelves. Sam claims the council hasnapost lted a finger to help despite the issue continuing for nearly two months. He believes itaposs because he owes the council £, which heaposs steadily repaying, after a benefit change. And he claims the council have told him that they will help once he repays his outstanding debt. The couple got social services, their midwe, and the kidaposs school to write to the council, but they havenapost done anything except asking for their money.  The horric living conditions have left the couple suffering with depression and anxiety as they feel trapped and hopeless. They claim the kids, aged one, three, four, five, six and nine, are visiting the doctors often with conditions they link to the situation. In a desperate attempt to find out whataposs wrong with them, they even phone  because we were so worried. But  told them itaposs unlikely it will be the mice and sewage. A spokesperson for Portsmouth City Council told The Mirror: Council officers attended the property on Wednesday last week and an order was raised for a drain to be unblocked on Friday.  We are waiting for confirmation that the drain was unblocked. We will also be helping the tenants clear the front and rear gardens, treat for mice and carry out any other repairs that are required. In a separate statement shared to The Sun, the council said they are not withholding any services from the family and have made several visits to the home. They claimed to have taken appropriate action, and that they werenapost notied about sewage at the property. The council added that a housing officer will be in touch with tenants and visit to investigate the situation.

The teenager was the first to make a referral on January , , and told The Mirror: “I was worried the way Star changed after Frankie met Savannah. She just changed.“Frankie would leave her in a baby walker on the carpet all day. She was still giving her baby milk at  months old.  “I telephoned social services, and I was with Frankie and Star when social services rang her to tell her they were coming to see her in an hour. I thought it was a bit stupid, as it was like ringing a criminal and telling them they are going to come round and arrest them in an hour. “Frankie spent the whole hour cleaning and tidying the house, we were at her mum Yvonne’s and getting Star all nicely sorted, covering up bruises. “In the end it was two police officers that arrived, not social workers. I was holding Star and they spoke to Frankie. I think social services tried to see Frankie again but she was not at home. “I later got a telephone call from social services telling me they are closing the case because Star is ‘safe in the hands of her mother. “I honestly feel quite gutted about the jury’s verdict on Frankie, I thought she should have been found guilty of manslaughter. I’m happy that Star has got some justice and really happy Savannah was found guilty of murder. But social services should have done more.” Hollie said she felt “really angry” and that “social services need to step up more” adding: “I’m just really gutted because I think changes really need to be made becausethey took my referral seriously, potentially Star wouldn’t be gone.” In February Frankie and Brockhill split and Star went to live with her great grandparents until the end of April because her mum was ‘struggling’. On May th, Frankie’s grandmother Anita Smith referred her granddaughter to social services after another relative told her Brockhill had been ‘slam choking’ Star. Together with her partner David Fawcett, the great grandmother looked after Star for ten weeks when Frankie couldn’t cope. Frankie managed to persuade them her grandmother’s report was ‘malicious’ because she was in a same-sex relationship with a ‘gypsy’. She then banned her grandmother from seeing Star and social services closed the case without informing Anita. In June Alicia Szepler, Smith’s sister and Star’s aunt, sends photographs of bruises to the police and speaks to officers. On June st, Star’s student father, Jordan Hobson, also made a referral to social services after he was sent a photo of his daughter’s bruised face. Police again visited their home and saw the markings on the baby’s head. This was the third referral.  Police, along with a social services representative, took Frankie and Star to Bradford Royal Infirmary that day, but she was seen by a doctor with only four months’ experience in child safely who saw the injuries in isolation and accepted the excuses that the toddler had bumped into a coffee table knob and hurt her leg playing with a puppy. On June rd Rachel Whiteley, a friend of Frankie’s mother, made a social services referral after observing her behaviour at a family barbecue. But  days later social services closed the case. On September nd, Frank Smith, Star’s paternal great-grandfather, made a social services referral after seeing a video of bruises on the infant’s face. Social services visited Frankie but were told she was in Scotland. On an unannounced visit next day, when Frankie was present with Brockhill, social workers observed the flat was clean, tidy and warm. They found a faint bruise to Star’s cheek and a bruise on her right shin. Star was unsteady on her feet and walked into a sofa while social services were present. Frankie said Star had fallen down the stairs. Social services closed the case on September th after the social worker concluded the referral was malicious.  Although the final referral was closed on th September, social services were still in contact with Frankie Smith right up until the day of Star’s death. Smith was due to meet the social worker on September nd, the day Star was murdered, but the meeting was put off for three days. The social worker sent a text to Smith to say: “Thanks for letting me know, we will do Friday at .am.”  Robbie Moore, Tory MP for Keighley and Ilkley, has called for the resignation of Susan Hinchclfe and the council’s chief executive Kersten England in the light of the Star Hobson case. He said: “Bradford Council bosses should hang their heads in shame. I have no confidence children’s services will ever be fit for purpose under its current leadership. “I am afraid it is my view that Council Leader Susan Hinchclfe and Chief Executive Kersten England must resign.” Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON MurderSocial servicesSocial workersCrimeDomestic violenceStar HobsonChild abuse\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Riley Gregersen, nine, was a typical young boy who loved playing football with his friends, but alarm bells began to be rung when he began to struggle with with his writing. Teachers attributed it to mental health problems, but when his terried parents took him to doctors they suggested it could be down to stress or even a trapped nerve. Within weeks, his arm began to shake uncontrollably meaning he couldnapost even feed himself. Got a story  Email webnew@mirror  Blood tests didnapost show anything concerning, but Riley was rushed to hospital after suffering a seizure during an after school club. His parents Gemma and Scott were given the devastating news that their son had an aggressive brain tumour called glioblastoma multorme . Due to where the tumour was, surgeons could only remove around % and the surgery was highly dangerous. His family raised funds for treatment in Germany but tragically the cancer spread to his spine and he was admitted to a hospice where he died on August . Now facing her first Christmas without Riley, the family have bravely spoken out in a bid to warn parents to be aware of the symptoms of brain tumours in children.  Gemma, , from Stourbridge, West Mids., said: Riley loved everything about Christmas and I have so many special memories to cherish. Every year he would sit with the Smyths Toys catalogue and tell me everything he wanted. He loved to pick out presents and write cards for his friends too he was such a kind and generous boy. Iaposll never forget the huge smile on his face when I would take his photo in front of our Christmas tree, it was the best thing ever. Riley always wanted to help people. After he died, so many people told me about how caring he was. Rileyaposs health initially went down hill just before Christmas  when he struggled to hold his pen at school and Gemma took him to their GP. Gemma, who is no longer with Scott, said: They said his symptoms were stress-related, or possibly a trapped nerve. We were sent away and told to come back in a few weeksapos time for a blood test,he was no better, which we did. Rileyaposs teachers also noticed his tremor was causing him to struggle to write and they contacted Gemma to say they were worried about his mental health.  Gemma, an admin assistant, added: I assured them that Riley had a happy home le and no reason to be feeling anxious or stressed. When the results from the blood tests came back, they didnapost reveal anything of concern, so Riley was referred for an aposurgentapos MRI scan but the appointment didnapost come through before he suffered the seizure on  January. Rileyaposs prognosis remained stark, so Gemma and Scott began researching alternative treatment options overseas. They found a private clinic in Germany which made peptide vaccines which could extend Rileyaposs le at a cost of £,. Despite a fundraising drive, Riley became too ill and in May doctors delivered the heartbreaking news that the cancer had spread. Gemma said: Things had been going so well when, in May, Riley started complaining of numbness in his legs and he had balance issues.  He was having problems going to the toilet, even though he was drinking a lot. I called for an ambulance and they took us into Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital. They did another MRI scan and when got the results, my world fell apart.The tumour had spread and four new tumours had appeared on his spine. There was very little they could do.Riley had more palliative radiotherapy but after that, there were no other treatments available. The German clinic sent Rileyaposs vaccines to the UK, as he was unable to travel, but Gemma couldnapost find anyone in the country willing to administer the vaccine because it was not certied by the NHS.She said: It was completely shattering. At .pm on  August, my precious boy died in my arms. Even though I knew it was coming, it was an absolute shock and just so hard to comprehend.One thing I am pleased to do this Christmas is to share our story to help raise awareness, in the hope that I can help to make a dference, in Rileyaposs name.Brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of  than any other cancer in the UK.

Specialists treating the woman at Addenbrookeaposs Hospital in Cambridge, had told a judge that le-support treatment should end, despite her familyaposs insistence she should be given more time. The patient, described only as AH in court papers, has not been publicly named to protect her privacy. Mrs Justice Theis has now ruled that le-support treatment can end, and that the woman can be allowed to die, after reconsidering arguments.  Last week, she examined up-to-date evidence at a hearing in the Court of Protection, where issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions are considered, over two days in London. Another judge had originally considered the case at a hearing in the Court of Protection in August. Mr Justice Hayden also concluded that le-support treatment should end and ruled that the woman should be allowed to die. The womanaposs adult children challenged his ruling in the Court of Appeal. Appeal judges upheld their challenge and said the case should be reheard - Mrs Justice Theis then oversaw a second Court of Protection trial.  Relatives told Mrs Justice Theis that in the past four months they had seen a bubblier person and someone who was more alert and aware.But specialists treating her said she had deteriorated since August.The news comes as the UK faces a new challenge in dealing with the Omicron iant, and as new rules for testing come into force. Anyone who has come into contact with a Covid- case must now use a lateral flow test for seven days instead of isolating - although they are not available on the government website. The government insisted on Monday that there was no shortage of kits as aposample suppliesapos exist it shops. Yet on Tuesday morning a new message on the gov.uk website said ,  and  did not have access to any more tests - as well as none being available for home deliveries. Boris Johnson reiterated that home test kits were available at pharmacies when he was challenged over the message on the website.He said: They can get those tests, we do have a ready supply of lateral flow tests. If you canapost get one online for any reason, then there are ample supplies in the shops. But what I think,I may say so, what that also shows is that people are doing the sensible thing, and getting tests as well.On Monday, the UK Health Security Agency said that due to exceptionally high demand, ordering lateral flow tests on gov.uk has been temporarily suspended to fulfil existing orders. It also was revealed today that there are no PCR Covid test slots left available anywhere across England.The government website says there are no PCR tests - the gold standard of coronavirus tests - available to the general public at walk-in and drive-in test sites across the country.The booking site said there are none available at every region in England while some slots are still available at sites in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. PCR test kits which are posted to peopleaposs homes, usually arriving the following day, are available, the website claims. The public are being advised to try again laterthey cannot get a test. Tests will not be available through helplines, the website added.

The mum had nodded to doctors to give consent to deliver Hope after medics told her they might have to deliver the baby early, although Laura said she has no recollection of this whatsoever,Manchester Evening News reports .I opened my eyes to see Hope on the bed with me, but I couldnapost move any part of my body, the -year-old said. All I could do was shake and nod my head. Laura, a teaching assistant, arrived at hospital struggling to breathe after being diagnosed with Covid at the beginning of the school summer holidays. Her condition deteriorated so much that she was sedated for an emergency C-section at  weeks and then put into a coma. It was only when Laura finally came round at the end of September - much to the relief of family and friends - that she realised her precious girl had arrived. Lauraaposs partner John Leece has been taking Hope for daily visits to see her mum in Trafford General, where sheaposs been undergoing intensive rehabilitation, including learning how to walk again. But after finally being allowed toto her home in Tyldesley, Wigan, sheaposs now been reunited with her family, including three-year-old son William and step-children Josh and Lexi. Family and friends, including her parents Lynn and Bill, were there to greet her as she arrived on Monday morning to a house decorated with balloons and aposwelcome homeapos posters. Iaposm so pleased to be home, said Laura, who had gestational diabetes throughout her pregnancy. The physiotherapist brought me home and John was there waiting for me with the kids. William was so excited he was shouting aposmummy, mummyapos and trying to get in the car.Itaposs been nearly five months since Laura was last at home, before she was initially treated at the Royal Bolton and later transferred to Wythenshawe Hospital, where she spent  days of her coma on an ECMO machine - the highest level of le support. John, , said he had aposevery faithapos that sheaposd have the strength to pull through. Iaposm ecstatic to have her back after all this time, he said. Itaposs been tough but weaposve had people helping us out and theyaposre all good kids so thataposs made it easier. The worst day was when they rang and said they needed to do an emergency C-section and then after that they said they needed to get her on one of the ECMO machines or  she could die. She met all the criteria, it was just a case of waiting to seethey had a bed. Once she was there we knew she was in the best place and I had every faith sheaposd pull through because sheaposd been fit and well before it. He added: I always had an inkling she would be coming home, just because of the person she is. She had her kids to come home for and a lot to fight for. After coming round from her coma, having had tracheostomy and feeding tubes fitted, it was two weeks before Laura was even able to speak and sheaposs since had to learn how to do the most basic things all over again. The muscles in her legs had deteriorated over the weeks and it was only at the beginning of December when she managed to walk again - firstly making her way down the hospital corridor with a frame and then holding the hand of her three-year-old son William. Lauraaposs physiotherapy will now continue at home and sheaposs been given ious support aids to help her around the house. For now sheaposll have a bed downstairs, but sheaposs already been tackling the stairs herself. I said to John when I got home that I just wanted to try them, she said. I did manage to get to the top but when I got there I needed to sit down and I needed help getting back up. Itaposll take some time but Iaposll get there. After a takeaway pizza night to celebrate her homecoming, the family are now looking forward to having a happy settled Christmas at home. Laura hopes toto her job at Tyldesley Primary School in September, when son William will also be starting there. And sheaposs been inundated with messages of support from parents and staff who canapost wait to have her back.

With many people in festive spirits they have been heading out to parties and drinks with friends before new restrictions are introduced in an attempt to slow the spread of the Omicron iant. In Portsmouth hundreds of people flocked to a themed night at the Astoria nightclub. People could be seen dressed up in their Christmas gear with plenty of Father Christmases and some snowmen on show. And it was not just Tuesday night as last weekend thousands were out in towns and cities for festive fun.  Little regard was taken for the highly contagious new Covid iant which is forcing the new rules from Wednesday. People will need to show that they have had two vaccine doses or a negative test in order to go into nightclubs and some other venues. The government has said that lateral flow tests should be used by people entering “high-risk settings like crowded places.  Nightclub owners have hit out at the new restrictions saying that a lack of rapid COVID- tests will make enforcement a big challenge.Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his Plan B measures to tackle the spread of the Omicron iant.The UK has registered almost , cases of Omicron, with  people hospitalised and one person dying after contracting the iant.  New rules were passed in Parliament on Tuesday though  members of Johnsonaposs own party voted against them. Kate Fuller, who owns the Electric Ballroom nightclub in Camden in north London said the lack of available rapid testing is a problem for her. Since the announcement of the restrictions, our business just took a massive downturn, she said.  Thereaposs no testing in a lot of the pharmacies. If you canapost get the tests, itaposs going to be really hard for people to come. I think for our security and everything, implementing these is just going to be, you know, a big challenge. The new rules will apply to unseated indoor events with  people or more, unseated outdoor events with over , people and events with more than , attendees.  Clara Cullen, venue support manager at charity Music Venue Trust, which supports around  music venues in the country, said there had been an increase in cancellations with income falling by % in the past week.

But what do they like to watch  Well, from the Duchess of Cambridge to Prince Harry and the Queen, we reveal some of their favourite shows...Downton Abbey Period drama Downton Abbey attracted millions of fans during its six seasons - and one of those is reportedly the Queen. According to the , Her Majesty is a huge fan of the show, even though she loves to point out any of its historical inaccuracies.Brian Hoey, the author of At Home With The Queen, told the publication about a previous conversation with a member of staff at Buckingham Palace. He said: “We were talking about Trooping the Colour and how the Queen always noticesanything is not quite right, such as one young officer she spotted wearing his medals in the wrong order not long ago. “Apparently she is exactly the same when she is watching the television. She loves watching Downton Abbey and pointing out things they have got wrong, partly because she is familiar with Highclere Castle, where it is filmed. She used to stay there as a guest of the Carnarvon family. Game of Thrones During an appearance on BBC Radio , Prince William and Kate revealed they are massive fans of box sets - and one of their favourite shows is Game of Thrones. And while on a trip to Germany, the couple met Tom Wlaschiha, who plays Jaqen H’ghar in the series, who claims they tried to press him for spoilers. He said: They said they really liked Game of Thrones and have watched every series. They wanted spoilers but I said I couldnapost tell them. Iaposm surprised they have time to watch such a long running series. Strictly Come Dancing  Strictly Come Dancing is a Saturday staple on the winter nights leading up to Christmas.And the hit BBC show can count on at least three royals fans - including Kate.At an event with presenter Claudia Winkleman and judge Shirley Ballas, William revealed: I have watched the show [Strictly] a couple of times.Catherine is a huge fan and my mother-in-law loves it.Meanwhile, the other two royal devotees of the show are Sophie Wessex and Lady Louise Windsor. They were spotted in the Strictly ballroom during the live shows in , cheering on then contestants including Faye Tozer and Stacey Dooley.According to Strictly host Tess Daly, Louise and Sophieaposs trip to watch the show was all part of a special birthday treat for Louise for her th birthday.Speaking to Hello!, Tess explained: It was lovely to have them there, we are very fortunate we have a few fans in the royal household… They did absolutely [get a backstage tour].Lady Louise was celebrating turning  and she said it was a treat to come and visit the show. Sheaposs a big fan, herself and her mother. They enjoyed all the action from the front row and they had a great night. It was great to welcome them. Line of Duty Police drama Line of Duty had fans gripped to the screen during its sixth series earlier this year.And of them was said to be the Queen herself, who became an avid watcher during lockdown at Windsor Castle. Her Majesty is said to have chatted about the ins and outs of AC-aposs mission to eradicate aposbent coppersapos with master of the household Vice-Admiral Sir Tony Johnstone-Burt, The Sunday Times reported.A royal source told The Sunday Times: “The Queen was very into Line of Duty and enjoyed discussing the plotlines with Tony.” Meanwhile, another royal fan is Sophie Wessex, who said she guessed who the elusive aposHapos was before it was revealed on screen. In an interview with Radio  Live, he said: I was really disappointed in myself for having guessed it. Because I was, yes... I kept on thinking ‘It can’t be, it can’t be him but it’s got to be. There isn’t any other choice. There is no-one  that it could be’. Jeopardy  Since leaving the UK for the United States, it seems Prince Harry has developed a love of a long-running American gameshow - Jeopardy.During a chat with James Corden on the Late, Late Show, Harry revealed that the show is part of his nightly routine with Meghan Markle. He revealed that after putting son Archie to bed, Meg might cook a meal, might order a takeaway, go upstairs, sit in bed, turn the TV on, watch some Jeopardy, maybe a little bit of Netflix.Fireman SamFireman Sam has been a kids classic TV show for more than  years - and one avid watcher was Prince George.His dad William revealed in  that George loved the show and remarked: Fireman Sam has taken an awful lot of interest.

All of us work full-time and give up our free time so when you add onto that on top of sorting out the mess and the pressures we all have at this time of year it was annoying.  Weaposve never had anything like this happen before, thataposs why we had to have a serious meeting about health and safety and volunteers being put at risk. One of the volunteers was there with her six-year-old child and the child unfortunately also ended up with a bit of egg on them.Following the incident, Okehampton Round Table published a post on Facebook to find out the identity of the culprits.James said: Quite a few people named the boys who were involved and we put out a post asking the parents to call us stating the Santa runs would be stopped until we received assurance it would not be repeated. We are very grateful for the support we received from the community, the neighbourhood policing team who rang us up and also the parents of the children involved who were embarrassed and quite annoyed with their children. But in the spirit of Christmas what we have decided to do is ask the children to apologise to Santa and the Roundtable volunteers, which they have done, and they offered to clean the sleigh. We had already done it, but they have put right their actions and they have been taught every action has a consequence and that a few minutes of fun for them can really ruin a community event. Although we had the support of the police we have dealt with it ourselves and have not gone down that avenue, again in the spirit of Christmas. As we were able to establish it was a one-off we are carrying on as usual so no children have missed out on seeing Santa. He added: Hopefully everyone is back on the good list again! The Okehampton Round Table Santa Sleigh raises vital money for local community projects such as buying Christmas presents for children whose families use its food bank, creating a sensory garden at Okehampton College and erecting a willow arch at St James Primary School.

Natasha Mead and partner Ben Sala took their daughter Ella to see a doctor after they noticed a strange white spot in her eye in photos they had taken. The couple, from Hull, also noticed something was not right with Ella when she was around six months old as she struggled to eat despite being advanced in many other ways. They initially explained away the odd signs but decided to take Ella to the doctor in June this year. The tot was quickly diagnosed with retinoblastoma - a rare childhood cancer that affects roughly  children in the UK per year. Around  per cent of cases are diagnosed in the first year of le. Ella’s condition is even rarer because, sadly, she has tumours behind both eyes which only happens in a third of cases.Natasha told Hull Live : “Ella is completely blind in one eye and has severe sight loss in the other.“She has just finished six cycles of chemotherapy. She got very sick and needed blood transfusions. She also suffered respiratory problems.” Natasha is speaking out in a bid to warn other parents not to take any chancesthey notice something isn’t right. She said: “Ella is our first child so we didn’t know what might be unusual or not. My partner noticed Ella was a bit bog-eyed. “She was also quite advanced but we noticed she was struggling using a spoon. I had to go back to work early because of the pandemic so we sent Ella to nursery and staff there also noticed she was struggling to eat. “We initially put it all down to her just being a baby but we were advised to get her checked out. “Doctors immediately recognised something was not right and she was seen by a specialist and diagnosed with retinoblastoma. “Ella went to see a specialist in Birmingham and she has to go there every month for check-ups.” Retinoblastoma occurs when nerve cells in the retina develop genetic mutations. These mutations cause the cells to continue growing and multiplying when healthy cells would die. This accumulating mass of cells forms a tumour. At diagnosis both of Ella’s retinas had completely detached, leaving her blind in her left eye with little vision remaining in her right. Natasha says early diagnosis can be crucial. “There is a phrase ‘know the glow’ which highlights the fact the white spot on eyeschildren in photos can be a sign of cancer,” she said. “Phone cameras don’t really use flashes but it is still important to know. “Since her diagnosis we have come across photos taken when she was roughly six months old and the glow is there in her eyes for all to see. “Itaposs such a horrible feeling knowing these photos have existed but we didnapost know sheaposs has been fighting this awful disease for so long. “I just feel other parents need to be aware and not to be embarrassed about seeking help. If it turns out to be nothing no one will laugh at you.” While Ella, now  months, has finished her first cycle of chemo, she will need further treatment. “She may need further chemo in smaller doses while she also has laser treatment and cryotherapy which liquies the tumour cells,” Natasha explained. “The tumours cannot be removed because they are too close to the retina.” Ella has had several MRI scans to make sure that the retinoblastoma has not invaded her optic nerves or spread from her eyes to other parts of her body. Retinoblastoma tends to affect very young children but it has le-long effects. Natasha said: “Ella’s tumours have shrunken massively thanks to the chemotherapy but she is still unfortunately not cancer-free. “The cancer is due to a faulty gene which can be hereditary but both me and Ben have been tested and we don’t have it. It seems she has just been really unfortunate, bless her. “Eventhe treatment works there is a chance it couldaround the age of seven. It also means she is susceptible to other cancers. “She will need to get check-ups and an MRI every year. The medical staff hope Ella can go on to lead a full le. “If it had been just one eye then they would probably remove it but at the moment they are treating both eyes. “The priority is to save Ella’s le, then to save her eyes and then her sightpossible. “Thankfully, this is one of the most survivable cancers but it causes a lot of damage.” Natasha has praised her daughter for the way she has taken everything in her stride. “Ella is amazing,” she said. “She has just got on with it all. “She is such a happy child and most of the time you would not know there was anything wrong with her. “Ella is just so outgoing and willing to get stuck in. “I was worried when she was diagnosed and started treatment, Ella would lose her happiness. “She has been very sick at times after treatment but she always bounces back.“The chemo has made her immunosuppressed. Every month she has caught the common cold which has made her spike a fever which means she has ended up at Hull Royal Infirmary for a few days per month.“The chemo drugs have also made her go off foods. So she had a NG tube inserted up her nose and down her throat so we can manually drip milk into her.” Natasha admits it has been very tough watching her daughter looks so vulnerable and poorly. “Seeing her become so ill every month and watching the side effects of the chemotherapy take hold of her tiny body has been a horrendous time for our family,” she said. “The damage the Retinoblastoma has caused to her eyes has been heartbreaking. “But she remains a happy little girl. The only thing is she has port in her chest, a kind of catheter, which allows for the chemo drugs to be administered into the main artery. It’s also used for routine and emergency blood samples to be taken. “But this has made her wary about strangers and anyone lting her top. Natasha admits it has not been easy for her and Ben but the sacrices are necessary. “For the first few months it was heartbreaking but you just have to get on with it,” she said. “It has been a very gruelling time as we have a number of appointments to attend and monthly trips to Birmingham. It has taken up a lot of our energy but it is worth itit can help Ella. “Apart from Ella’s initial appointment in Birmingham, due to Covid restrictions, me and her dad have not been able to attend them together with her. “Itaposs been a struggle having to manage the amount of information we are given alone, especially the hard news. “Her first birthday was spent in Leeds General Infirmary having a lumbar puncture and spinal tap - used to be certain the cancer has not spread into her bone marrow. Natasha hopes Ella will be able to live a full and happy le in due course evenher sight is severely impaired.

It makes me happy to talk about it.”  Josh, from Wakefield, West Yorks, says this by writing slowly on his iPad. His words are then spoken by a talker device. Josh’s ­disabilities and learning dficulties include severe epilepsy and a neurological condition that is undiagnosed which impacts his muscles. It means he can communicate very little verbally and must be fed through a tube into his stomach. His mobility is also impacted, and he relies on wheelchairs, walking frames and sticks.  A team at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London are trying to find an official diagnosis and ­explanation for his condition.Mum Joanne Kendall contacted Make-A-Wish UK, which is being supported by this year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal, at a time when Josh’s health was particularly bad.Because his wishes were meeting Santa and flying on a plane, the charity arranged for the trip to Disneyland Paris for him and his younger siblings Charles, Nicole and Danielle.

But for some children the festive season will be very dferent. Across the country there are more than , young people who are critically ill. Many will be spending what should be a special time of the year in hospital. Others will have to have treatment, scans or blood tests. With your help we can give them a Christmas that they will always remember. This year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal is raising funds for Make-A-Wish UK that helps seriously ill young people make their dreams come true.It could be they want to meet their hero or heroine or feed an animal at the zoo or travel to see Santa in Lapland. The money raised could help Joshua, six, who has severe epilepsy, achieve his wish of a bedroom makeover or Summer, also six, who has acute leukaemia and dreams of a bouncy castle. Each year Make-A-Wish helps hundreds of critically ill children achieve their letime’s ambition. But to make a wish come true takes an army of volunteers, supporters and donors. That’s why every penny you donate could make a dference. Granting a wish can transform a child’s le. It gives them something to look forward to. For others it provides a special memory which makes the treatment they need more bearable.It can also help their parents who, despite doing everything they can for their sick child, feel it is not enough. Jason Suckley, Make-A-Wish UK chief executive, said: “I met the family of a boy who was recovering from brain surgery. “His grandmother told me how dficult it had been for her to watch her daughter struggle with the challenges of her son’s condition.But while they were enjoying his wish together, her daughter turned to her and said, ‘There is still magic in this world isn’t there mum ’ . “That’s just one instance that illustrates how the power of a wish lies in sharing positive memories with loved ones. “Every donation from Mirror readers will help us create those memories – bringing joy to ill children and their families during the darkest of times.” Josh has since thrived, achieving GCSEs and his bronze Duke of Edinburgh award. He is now at college learning vocational and le skills. Josh is involved in STARboard, Make-A-Wish UK’s youth ­advisory group. He attends remotely using iRobot and his talker device. Josh said: “I like to help more children have a wish.” Joanne added: “In the pandemic he spent a year and a half in his room because he is vulnerable. Joining STARboard, he could meet other young people. He’s even chaired two meetings.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The Walt Disney CompanyGreat Ormond Street HospitalFather ChristmasLearning dficultiesTheme parksDisneyland ParisMirror Christmas appealXmas Appeal \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mark Goodram, , and Jon-Ross Watson, , made national news in  after hitting the jackpot from the £ scratch card.However, Camelot, the lottery operator, refused to hand over the winnings when officials learned the debit cad used to buy the scratch card did not belong to either of the men. The pair were accused of buying five scratchcards, including the jackpot winner, without the consent of the credit cardholder.The lottery louts both denied three counts of fraud but changed their pleas to guilty as their trial at Bolton Crown Court was due to start.  The penniless pair had travelled to London from Bolton in April  to go begging, with Goodram having written a strangeraposs debit card details on his hand. He keyed in the numbers at Waitrose in Clapham, South London when buying lottery scratch cards and went on a bender in the capital. They shared pictures of themselves boozing over four days in celebration of winning the prize, but their joy was short-lived.  However, Camelot grew suspicious when Goodram phoned to collect the money but told them that he did not have a bank account where they could pay his winnings, despite using debit card details to buy the winning card. Recorder Sarah Johnston sentenced Goodram to  months in prison and Watson to  months. She told the pair today: You must have thought all your Christmases had come at once. Your offending is rooted in greed and a total lack of respect for the property of others.

Forecasters are predicting that the chances are not high for a white Christmas despite freezing temperatures coming from north easterly winds. As the country recovers from snow and gales from Storms Arwen and Barra, the mild temperatures have continued over the past few days after it reached a balmy C last weekend. But the temperatures are expected to drop over Christmas with “dry air and fog”.Jim Dale, of British Weather Services told the Express : “The main two factors in the short term will be dry weather and fog. At times the fog will be dense and will sit in valleys. “In the short to medium period there will be lots of fog. There is no storm potential this side of Christmas.” Netweather charts show most of the country will have sub zero temperatures on Christmas Day while it could drop to -C in the west and the north west of England as well as Scotland. The main hazard will be ice on roads, this side of Christmas,” said Mr Dale. Christmas day will be pseudo-white, a heavy frost on the ground, in bookies language this is the favourite forecast. He continued: It will be a pseudo white Christmas. This means frost instead of snow. It will certainly be cold enough for snow, but there will be less moisture in the air to form snow. The weather will become progressively colder as we move towards Christmas.”  The mercury is set to drop further from December  when the UK could be hit by a snow bomb. If a storm’s central pressure deepens by millibars in  hours, it will earn the title weather bomb which coinciding with snow could drive an eruption of winter downpours. Netweather.tv states: “Confidence is lower for this period but there is a greater chance of colder weather heading in from the east at some point during this period as highest pressure transfers further north, most likely towards Scandinavia. Weather maps by WXCharts shows rain hitting the south west of England on December  with mm set to fall in an hour while in the North West it will fall as snow with cm expected an hour and more overnight.  By midnight December , up to cm of snow an hour is expected to have fallen across much of the north west and south of Scotland, as well as in Southampton and Cardf. Mr Dale said: After Christmas, there is a northeasterly cold air coming. It will get properly cold after Christmas with the possibility of a white New Year. The potential for snow will be high after Christmas. There is a cold pool over Europe and we could be left open to this polar air over the New Year. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Some sunshine in northern Scotland, north Wales, and parts of northern and eastern England. Many other areas cloudy some rain across west and south Scotland, Northern Ireland and Cumbria, and patchy drizzle in the south. Mild. Windy in the north. Tonight: Rain pushing northeastwards across western and northern parts of Scotland. Still a little drizzle possible in the south. Some cloud breaks in between, which may lead to some fog patches. Thursday: Any fog in central and eastern England may be slow to clear. Some sunshine possible, mainly parts of northeastern UK. Still damp in the far north. Elsewhere cloudy but dry. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Mostly dry but rather cloudy. A few sunny intervals, while clear spells by night could allow patchy fog. Winds mostly light but temperatures trending downwards, with patchy night frost possible.

Hope Kedziorski, who is just -months-old, was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer called myelodysplasia in October last year.Since then the brave toddler has endured a series of bone marrow ops and received blood transfusions and chemotherapy. The youngster also contracted sepsis.But as she sat at home beneath the fairy lights, wearing her bright red festive jumper alongside her cuddly toy reindeer, her proud mum Kirstie Wilkie, , said: “This Christmas is going to be extra special.”  Together with Hope’s dad Tomasz Kedziorski, , she spent months at her daughter’s hospital bedside. She said: “This summer has been beyond tough as we have watched our little girl battle this cruel disease. “But despite being poorly, Hope took it in her stride and she was still happy all of the time.” The couple had been alerted by a rash on their baby daughter’s neck. Kirstie said: “The rash was on her neck for four weeks until she underwent further blood tests which set off alarm bells as her platelets were low. “She had a bone marrow biopsy which revealed she had blood cancer.” But because of her tender age chemotherapy could not start immediately. “The side effects of chemotherapy can be le-threatening and for babies so young this risk is even higher which is why we had to wait until April.  “We spent every day by her side in the hospital and we went home for a week here and there. “The scariest moment was when she had sepsis as her oxygen levels dramatically dropped. “The whole summer was terrying but Hope continued to amaze us. “She had a total of six bone marrow biopsies and three central lines fitted and removed. The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news. We recognise the news agenda can sometimes feel overwhelmingly negative.And while itaposs our job to keep you informed and hold those in power to account, we are making a commitment to also report more hopeful news.

And now the family from South Queensferry, Scotland, are looking forward to a fabulous Christmas. Kirsty, an HR advisor, added: “Last Christmas was tainted because we knew it wasn’t long until she was going to start treatment. “We were apprehensive and scared in case we were going to lose our little girl to cancer or the side effects of chemotherapy. “We are in a much better place this year. She has beaten her cancer and we have a nice future to look forward to.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mirror More HopefulHospitalsCancerBabies\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

One person wrote: “I would actually drop dead right then and thereI saw this.” While another said: “Ma’am a for sale sign would be in my front yard right then and there.” And a third scared commenter posted: “Time to just move and leave everything behind.” But others thought the furry creatures were “cute”, with several joking they were just trying to help fix the machine.

Harry Styles recently charged £ for a crew neck jumper on the front that simply just says ‘pleasing’ on the front - the name of his new skincare and nail nish business. Fans had the option to buy the jumper on pre-salethey had previously ordered someone from the newly founded brand, but even then the website still crashed and people were struggling to buy one. I was one of these people in the queue to get the jumper, I was just finishing my college lesson when they went on sale and immediately it was a mad rush to buy it. There is a need to have it and to be one of those first fans wearing the jumper that has been spoken about so much on Twitter, it’s almost asthe hype is worth the money. Personally, I must have spent thousands over the years on a range of One Directionmerchandise ranging from a Louis Tomlinson cardboard cut out to a Harry Styles watermelon-shaped water bottle inspired by his song Watermelon Sugar.  As the price of merchandise is so expensive, I used to ask for it along with concert tickets for my birthday or Christmas presents. But now as I have a job, I buy it myself and because I have no bills or rent to pay, it allows me to just go and purchase the merchandise - sometimes without even thinking about it. When it was One Direction’s -year anniversary, I even made a cake to celebrate . As I’m now  it’s not like I’m still seven, the age I became a fan, I think the reason I’m still this much of a fan is because I enjoy the music and the band as a whole and that’s why I still collect the merchandise - no matter the cost. Whilst some artists have ‘cheaper’ merch, Billie Eillish’s merchandise would be considered a bit too pricey in my opinion - she charges around £ for a hoodie and £ for a pair of limited edition rhinestone jogging bottoms. There are other options to buying the over-priced merchandise though, small businesses on Etsy make alternative versions of merchandise and within five minutes of a Google search you can find copies of almost every artists’ merch.  While some people prefer to buy the ‘unofficial’ merch because it is simply a cheaper option, others prefer to buy their merchandise to support the artist. Erin Memmott, a Taylor Swt fan said: “I buy Taylor’s merch to support her career and art, especially during the pandemic as she’s released four albums.  “Particularly for Folklore and Evermore which were made entirely in isolation, she released them with no thought of profits - she just wanted to provide some escapism for her fans. “I think it’s really cool to wear a shirt with your favourite lyrics on and know that you’re giving back to the artist who puts so much thought and care into their music. “I also obviously love the designs and enjoy expanding my collection.” And as many people including myself are willing to pay the expensive price of merchandise for their favourite artists, it seems like the price will keep going up.

She explained: I have the sort of name that has several common shortened versions - think Samantha Sammy Sam. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here And my entire le, people have insisted on being too familiar and shortening it against my wishes. I only ever introduce myself as ‘Samantha’, sign off all my emails as Samantha, and insist on it when people ask what I prefer. I think Sammy is too young-sounding for me, and growing up I knew another Sam who was a real piece of work, so I hate being called by that name. But much to her disappointment, her fellow workers always shorten her name - despite her repeatedly correcting them. I’ve only won the battle with one person, who took the hint after I started calling him Jonathan instead of his preferred Jon, she added. He askedhe was in trouble since only his mother calls him Jonathan, and I told him that I thought we were playing a game of getting each other’s names wrong… He now calls me the right name, so success! But things turned sour recently after she fell out with a manger who insists on calling her aposSamapos despite her obvious attempts to correct him. So she came up with a simple way to get back at him - but it has landed her in hot water. The woman wrote: His name is Richard, so I’ve been casually calling him Dick all week. It’s a valid shortened version of his name. And when he’s objected, I’ve reminded him that I’m Samantha and not Sam. I had such high hopes for progress… but instead I’ve earned myself a meeting with HR.Asking for advice on what to do next, lots of Redditors advised her to stick to her guns. One commented: Be factual and concise with your story to HR. Ask why itaposs OK for him to shorten your name, but you canapost shorten his. Take all emotions out of it. My guess is heaposs spun this to where youaposre calling him A dick, and not just calling him Dick. Another wrote: If you drop in the words: ‘toxic workspace’ ‘calling me inappropriate names in a manner calculated to annoy’ and ‘hostile work environment’ while you explain your point of view, I predict you will have a more favourable outcome. But others disagreed, with one adding: I have a similar problem with people shortening my name but I would never be dumb enough to call a manager in my company “Dick” no matterit is a legitimate nickname from way back when. Choosing an insult-related version of his name was deliberately provocative. You know exactly what you called him, as your half-hearted defence of ‘it’s a valid shortened version of his name’ proves. Protesting a bit too much there, commented one person.

Conflict, economic collapse, the worst drought in  years and Covid have brought the nation to the brink of disaster, the Disasters’ Emergency Committee said. DEC members fear some children have already died and the lives of a million under-fives are in jeopardy as winter bites. Parts of Afghanistan can drop to -C. More than  million people – % of the population – are short of food, said DEC members. They include Cafod, the International Rescue Committee, British Red Cross and Save the Children. Hospitals are already low on supplies to treat malnourished mothers and children, the DEC said. Chief exec Saleh Saeed added: “The situation in Afghanistan is now beyond horric. A million children are at risk of dying this winter. “Our members are on the ground and already helping but we urgently need to scale this work up. “People are starving – eight million are on the brink of famine. “We’re urging people to donate to help families feed their children.” The DEC appeal will be broadcast across TV today. Government ministers have agreed to match public donations up to £million. The DEC said just £ is enough to feed a family for a week.

The pair entered their big day on a huge circular swing with fireworks, but something holding the podium snapped and twisted it so they were chucked to the floor.The couple plunged ft from the metal cage to the floor where their shocked guests looked up in horror.Thankfully they only sustained minor injuries and could carry on with the ceremony  minutes later in Raipur, Chhattisgar, on Monday.Event managers Joe, who organised the ceremony, apologised for the blunder.  An employee said the accident took place during the coupleaposs Sangeet ceremony, a night of celebration where guests and family are invited to dance and sing a few days before the wedding itself. The employee blamed the botched entrance on technical issues. He added: No one suffered injuries in the incident. The bride and the groom are safe.” The company will make sure similar incidents donapost happen again, he added.  The video was widely shared on social media, where users likened the overkill entrance to a circus show. One said: “I donapost know why show off needs nowadays in marriages. Nowadays Marriages should be done under supervision of stunt masters... doctors...” Another added: “Empathise with the couple, but on a serious note whataposs the need of that acrobatic stuff.” One US bride had a similarly disastrous wedding day, when she fainted on her groom before her bridal gown was defecated on by a baby nephew - all while she was vomiting.Hollee Lynnea-Kolenda Darnell, , who is from the US city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, got hitched recently to new hubby, Jackson, at a ceremony in Florida.Though the day started well, a sudden bout of sickness caused her to swoon into her concerned hubbyaposs arms during their vows.Her worried sweetheart can be heard asking whether she is okay as she comes back around. Hollee - dressed in a flowing, white bridal gown - shakes her head and stumbles over to the edge of the gazebo, and vomits over the side.

Eitan Shaken, , miraculously survived more than  hours after injuring himself on the Ojo del Albina glacier near Ushuaia in Southern Argentina. He was found suffering from hypothermia and was rescued when he managed to use his mobile phone to tell of his accident and a local rescuer saw it and raised the alarm, according to local reports.Eitan shared the video, recorded minutes after the accident and in which he asks rescuers to contact his mother on Instagram. His caption read: Those who know me know that I donapost like to philosophize on social networks but this time, unfortunately, I have no choice but to write a little more. Last Wednesday I went for a walk in Ushuaia and fell about  metres. I waited for rescue for a day, disconnected, without taking food or water and also with my pelvis and elbow broken. When they found me I was on the verge of death from hypothermia.  Eitan was taken to hospital, where he was treated for fractures to his pelvis and one of his arms. He said: I donapost understand how I didnapost die. Video online shows him having apparently given up hope at being rescued, with his face bloodied, recording a video in which he asks rescuers in English to contact his mother. Eitan said: When they found me I was on the verge of death from hypothermia.  Other footage shared online shows him being put in a helicopter on a stretcher. Firefighter Federico De La Torre said Eitan was lucky because at the time of the accident, the day was very beautul and the night was not cold compared to how it usually is. Eitan thanked his rescuers on social media and praised the medical personnel who are still treating him at the Ushuaia Regional Hospital. Eitan said: I left Israel when I finished my military service. There I decided to go around the world, particularly South America. In fact, my dream was to visit Antarctica and Ushuaia, from where I had read a lot of books. But a few days after arriving in Argentina I suffered the accident that I thought would end everything. He added: Itaposs always fun to rediscover how good the human race is. Iaposm not proud of what happened to me, but Iaposm glad it ended up that way. After I got sick with cancer a few years ago, dealing with death up close for the second time in my le is not an easy thing. Take care of yourself and be responsible. A piece of advice for all travellers: Fly on your trip, but try not to fly off your trip. The film  Hours is about adventurer Aron Ralston who becomes trapped when a boulder falls on his arm. Over five days, he makes the agonising decision to cut his arm off to free himself.

I can understand that this must be absolutely hellish.“In the short term we need to do something immediately about trying to discourage people from parking in inappropriate places and I’m more than happy to take that forward to the community action teamwith the police.“I think in the medium term we need to be trying to encourage people, when there are peak times, to not park there but to park down in the town.”Also at this week’s meeting was Emma Guy from Enduro World Series , who formerly worked as project coordinator for the Tweed Valley Tourism Bid..removeShe said: “I’m well aware of this issue and some of us [from Tweed Valley Tourism Bid] did try and tackle it on the ground about a year and a half ago with putting signs up near the Cauld.“So around the event at the beginning of October we had shuttles so people wouldn’t park in these hotspots, we cordoned off areas, we spoke to the golf club and we had marshals in place to police any bad behaviour, so tat worked quite well.“Our kind of feeling is that this is an ongoing problem and it does need solutions, there needs to be some kind of visitor infrastructure investment and certainly in my role with the Tourism Bid we were pushing really hard for that.“From an EWS point of view, with regard to events, we worked quite hard to manage that problem because we know how disruptive and how unpleasant that can be.“In my role with EWS we would support and put our weight behind any proposals to the council to SOSEto try and alleviate this.”Tweeddale East councillor Shona Haslam, of the Conservatives, added: “In terms of the long term [solution] obviously we’ve got £ million coming into mountain biking infrastructure into Innerleithen and £ million for a town the size of Innerleithen is pretty signicant.“So, we’ve got the Mountain Biking Innovation Centre that is moving forward in the background, obviously there’s a lot of commercial stuff in there that we’re not allowed to talk about, and there is the bike park as well. There is going to be signicant parking and infrastructure and resources.”"},{"url":null,"title":"peebles-pupils-recognised-prize-giving-ceremony","story":"PEEBLES High recently celebrated its annual prize-giving event. Here, members of the school’s higher journalism class interview some of the winners and those involved on the day...Headteacher’s messageThis year we celebrate our amazing young people and their astounding achievements in their studies through the medium of the printed press. Is it the same as enjoying the embarrassment of your granny cheering from the front row  Or as rewarding as seeing the pride on the faces of family members as you collect your certicate on stage with a smile and a handshake  Of course not. Nothing about school le post-fire post during COVID seems as rewarding or real as it once did but, be in no doubt, the young people celebrated here today are every bit as worthy of celebration and congratulations as their predecessors and perhaps even more so given all they have had to overcome and deal with to win the prizes we celebrate in this article.Perhaps you can take heart that this year’s Peebles High School prize giving offers something more permanent than fleeting moments of adulation and applause. It offers an article than can be cherished for years to come as a reminder of how our young people triumphed against the odds. Who knows, perhaps in years to come one of this year’s prize winners will be a granny or grandpa waving this copy of the Peeblesshire in the front row shouting, “I won that same prize in – prizes really meant something in my day.” Perhaps that is a bit fancul but, as your head teacher, I want to thank each and every one of you for succeeding in tough times and bringing such pride and honour to our school. Well done.And well done too to our higher journalism class and their teacher, Ms Ness, for the hard work that brings you this celebration of our fantastic young people. I also extend a special thanks to Jacqueline Wilson, the recently retired headteacher of Kingsland Primary for being our special guest in school awarding the certicates and trophies in preparation for this most unusual of prize giving events..removeCampbell Wilson, PHS rectorSpecial guestSquadron leader Stewart Campbell“As a former Peebles High School pupil, I’m delighted to have been asked to support the school’s annual prize giving. It’s important that not only the winners of these awards are praised but all Peebles High School pupils who have had to deal with their own challenges throughout the year.“I have incredibly fond memories of my time at the school, particularly with the PE department who went above and beyond to help me start on my career path. I urge all of the pupils to enjoy their time at the school, reach out for help and support when it is needed, and never stop chasing their dreams.“Congratulations to all the award winners, your hard work and dedication has been rightly recognised. I wish you all the very best for your next challenges and hope they give you joy along the way.”A former pupil of Peebles High School, Stewart joined the RAF as a pilot after completing a bachelor of education in physical education at the University of Edinburgh.

The winner of the Maigret Cup this year is Thomas Neville. Thomas has won this award through his success studying Spanish and French at Higher level. The class was fortunate enough to interview Thomas regarding the award and asked him how he felt to have won this. He said: “I’m really impressed with myself, obviously the award for overall linguist is really prestigious, and I’m really chuffed with myself as there is obviously a lot of languages at this school so to have won the best overall award for languages is something that I’m really proud of.”By Harry NessAmy Brown: Outstanding Musical ContributionOn November  the class interviewed former Peebles High School student Amy Brown to discuss her achievement of the Outstanding Musical Contribution Award. This is presented in recognition of the huge commitment made to the extra curricular le of the school and is awarded to a pupil who have been a source of inspiration to their fellow musicians throughout their time at Peebles. She was delighted to have won, even though she only took music for enjoyment and went on to express her disappointment at not being able to perform fully last year. She graciously stated that she was glad pupils are “able to get back to that now and other people are enjoying it”. While Amy is not pursuing music further , she explained that “it’s not something I want to stop doing… It was probably one of my favourite subjects, probably the one I was most relaxed aboutthat makes sense. It was always a nice environment to be in and I think that helped me enjoy it a lot more”. Amy then admitted at the risk of sounding “cliché”, that the music department concerts were the highlight of her years at the school. At the end of the interview, she imparted some very wise advice for younger years. She said: “Have more confidence in yourself, don’t care as much about what other people think.”By Madeleine HubertChristopher O’Hare: George OB Thomson Memorial CupThis award was created by professor George Thompson, who taught in the English department at Peebles High School. He devoted large parts of his research to the study of pupils with additional needs and was always adamant that they should be integrated into the “le and work of the whole school”. The council of Tweeddale wanted to celebrate the late professor George Thompson by awarding this memorial quaich to the most creative and enterprising entry from pupils with additional needs for a project devised by the school in conjunction with the society. When the class interviewed Christopher he said he felt “brilliant and honoured” to receive this award. He told us that one teacher that improved Christopher’s school le was Mr Travis, from the technology department. Christopher described him as a “funny guy” and “nice person”, who he says is happy to help whenever. He added that design and manufacture was his favourite subject as it enabled him to unleash his creativity. Not only is Christopher creative, but funny too, and when asked what his act in a school talent show would be he replied: “I like to make people laugh and feel happy”. Finally, Christopher was asked what he wishes to do in the future. Filled with energy, he stated that he would like to join the army. The skills and qualities which Christopher has shown in order to gain this award will help him achieve his future plans. The school wishes Christopher all the best, and know he will do well in the world which anxiously awaits his talent, kindness and phenomenal humour.By Keeley RippinBen Rorison: George OB Thomson Memorial Cup, and Balfour Medal This year’s worthy prize winner of the Balfour Medal and the George OB Thomson cup is Ben Rorison. Both prizes are awarded to an inidual with a positive presence and creative outlook within their community and school le. This was an area in which Ben excelled. When asked how he felt about receiving both awards Ben stated that he was “shocked and delighted to have been picked”. Ben also mentioned that his favourite subject was music and that he wanted to pursue this by becoming a music teacher for those with additional needs. When asked what his favourite memory was at Peebles High, Ben said is was helping first year pupils and helping around the school as a prefect, just showing how deserving of this prize Ben is. The positive impact that Ben had on the school will stay with those students he helped and the teachers he worked with. The school has no doubt that Ben will continue to be a role model and inspiration to all who are fortunate enough to work with him.By Olivia ThornburrowAbbie Sorrell: Geoffrey Simpson Award for Head PrefectOne winner of the Geoffrey Simpson award is ex-head girl Abbie Sorrell. The class’ first question regarded the important issue of who her favourite teacher was. She replied: “I don’t really do favourites, butI had to choose it would be Lesley Johnson. Chemistry used to be one of my weaker subjects , however I learned to love it and always looked forward to her classes”. However, she may have been won over in another way as she finishes her reply with “cake days were always a firm favourite of mine too”.Abbie was asked what her favourite memory of Peebles High School was and she responded enthusiastically “the German exchange trip”. She added: “I went as a member of the choir and loved meeting like-minded people and embracing a dferent culture. Not to mention the infamous Loch Lomond song which was always a favourite of mine.”When asked about her future plans, Abbie replied: “Wow, thinking about the future seems so daunting, however I hope that my uni degree will allow me to work in a hospital environment where I can help people. I also love the idea of travel and going on adventures to make some memories.”The class asked Abbie to reflect on and offer advice to her first year self, and she responded with “the list is long… the main thing I’d say is not to be so hard on myself and to accept that set backs are important for learning just as much as success”. Carrying on the theme of advice Abbie was asked what she would say to this year’s head team and she told them to “embrace everything because the year will be over before you know it. Therefore, just make the most of every opportunity and most of all enjoy yourself and have fun working with your peers”.By Rosie DykesEuan Macrae: Geoffrey Simpson Award for Head PrefectEuan Macrae was awarded the prestigious Geoffrey Simpson Award for his efforts as head boy. Euan had to show certain skills such as leadership and teamwork in order to effectively guide the school. In an interview with Euan, who is now studying Medicine at University, he highlighted how the school fire and COVID had affected his work ethic during his final few years in school, and how this has impacted the lives of not only himself but also his year group going into exams and beyond. He explained that “we’d never sat proper higher exams which would have set us up for the bigger exams that we were going to have to sit further down the line so the damage from that is probably still lasting”. The class asked Euan who his hero was, he very honestly answered with his grandfather, saying that he had always looked up to him due to his intelligence and bravery. When asked who his favourite teacher was at school, Euan passionately discussed how Miss Dunlop, who taught history, influenced his high school experience as “she had the entire class focused on what she was saying and she never even had to raise her voice. I soon realised that learning could be actually so much fun as well as informative”.By Louise RussellRachel McManus: Tweed Reads PrizeCampbell Hunter was a much-loved member of the Peebles community. He made fantastic contributions to the Tweed Reads organisation and thrived under the leadership role. He was kind, compassionate and showed a real love of encouraging the younger generations to explore and enjoy reading. Campbell worked tirelessly alongside the other members of Tweed Reads and valued the importance of learning, community and service. Campbell was such an important part of the community, and his astounding contribution to Tweed Reads only proved how far he was set to go outside of school.The Tweed Reads prize is named after Campbell Hunter, not just to honour his memory but to honour everything he stood for and his contributions to the Tweed Reads club. The prize is awarded to the few who epitomise Campbell’s wonderful leadership qualities and share his values of learning and community. The Campbell Hunter prize for  goes to Rachel McManus who consistently worked creatively within the confines of COVID regulations and was always relentlessly positive.When the class asked Rachel about the prize itself and how she felt to have won it, she described Campbell as “a huge part of Tweed Reads in his last few years of high school and had a real passion for helping young children in the community develop their reading skills and form a love for reading”. Rachel says she feels “honoured to have won the Campbell Hunter prize through Tweed Reads” and she hopes to continue her involvement with the organisation in coming years.When asked in an interview how the fire and pandemic affected her work ethic within school she replied it had “a massive impact on students”. She then went on to congratulate the school saying it has “worked hard to ensure that pupils were still able to have a good amount of teaching with being online and there was always support available should anyone have needed it”. Rachel closed her answer by admitting that “it was hard to concentrate on work at home, so you really had to push yourself to stay motivated and keep on top of the workload”.Rachel was asked how she felt the award carried on Campbell’s legacy. She responded saying that it demonstrates all of the commitment he put into Tweed Reads and his caring nature over his home community.She added: “In my sixth year of high school I heard many stories of Campbell from Tweed Reads leaders who had worked alongside him. They always said how much commitment he had to the charity and how much he cared about truly representing the ethos of the charity so therefore I feel that the Campbell Hunter prize is a true legacy of all the hard work and dedication that he put into the charity.”By Rosie Dykes"},{"url":null,"title":"laws-implications-e-scooters","story":"POLICE in the Scottish Borders are warning anyone planning to purchase an e-scooter this Christmas to make sure they know the laws and implications beforehand.Using an e-scooter in a public place in Scotland is illegal.This includes roads, pavements, parks, town centres and promenades.

year, opting instead to spend the £ it would cost to dress a living Christmas tree next winter – “like every other town in East Lothian” – leaving the town without a tree this year.However, following a backlash by locals criticising the group’s failure to light up the town, the community group confirmed that a temporary tree would indeed be installed at Coronation Gardens later this week.Historically, a Christmas tree has been displayed at the war memorial however, due to ongoing refurbishment at Civic Square, the space cannot be decorated this year.Additionally, permanent lights – which the community council arranged to have installed on two trees in the town – have suffered delays due to Storm Arwen, but the group “remains hopeful this will be resolved soon”.An online statement by the group said: “The community council has become aware of a series of provocative posts on other local social media pages about the town’s Christmas lights.“The current community council was only formed in October, following public elections in September.“The previous committee took the decision in  not to pay out the usual £ for a temporary Christmas tree and put that money towards a living Christmas tree and towards permanently dressing with lights some mature living deciduous trees in the town.“The cost for tree-dressing is in the region of £, per tree.“Two trees were dressed for us by independent contractors in late autumn but are still awaiting connection to nearby lampposts by East Lothian Council electricians.“This is work the previous CC executive team valiantly attempted to have put in place for several months prior to their departure and the new CC executive team are still chasing for completion.”Following a review of the  lights for lampposts – currently stored away – a member discovered that many were in an unsuitable condition for display.The lights cost the team more than £, when purchased several years ago.Additionally, brackets and sockets to hang the lights are missing from lampposts.The statement added: “A decision was taken to trust that East Lothian Council would be good to its word for the - Christmas season and connect up the two new trees, allowing us to invest this money in dressing more permanent deciduous trees next year.”Fiona O’Donnell, ward councillor, said: “I am pleased that there will be some Christmas lights in Prestonpans this year.“I know that the community were keen to see this happen after such a dficult year.“Going forward, I want to work with the community council to explore how we make sure that there will be Christmas lights in future years.“We can learn from the example of the gala committee, who work all year round to make the Prestonpans Gala a real highlight of the year.“The exchanges on social media have been helpfulin explaining what is involved and how other communities arrange for lights in their area.“I think there is an understanding that having Christmas lights in the town will need volunteers fromthe local community.“Panners always step up when their community needs them and I am confident that we can work together to build on what we have this year and make it even better in future years.”The community council added: “It’s worth remembering that the members are unpaid volunteers.“Like those iniduals posting nonsense, we have jobs, lives, hobbies, family and other things to be getting on with too.“Like everyone who lives in the town, young or old, recent arrival or th-generation Panner, we all want to create a beautul, peaceful and happy town for us all to live, work and grow old in.”A number of Facebook users responded to the statement, with one stating: “Folk are going to voice their opinions as there has been no communication to inform the community that this decision was made.”Another said: “It’s a sad state of affairs when other community councils can organise to have lovely Xmas lights on lampposts but Prestonpans and Port Seton can’t.”Another said: “Why has it taken for comments made on other media pages for you to put up a statement  When were you going to let the town know we were not getting the Christmas lights

The free exhibition, due to open late summer , will explore the legacy of Sir William Burrell as a man and collector and his motivations to establish an internationally renowned museum for the people of Glasgow and beyond.Professor Frances Fowle, Senior Trustee, Sir William Burrell Trust, said: \"We are delighted to acquire this profoundly moving bronze by Camille Claudel for the Burrell Collection. This outstanding artist, although underrepresented in this country, was an important role model for women sculptors at the turn of the twentieth century. The sculpture will perfectly complement the museum’s important holding of works by Auguste Rodin, with whom Claudels career was so closely aligned.”Read more: Glasgows riverside: greatest untapped development opportunity in Western EuropeClaudel became a sculptor at a time when it was very dficult for women to do so. The École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where artists would usually attend to become a sculptor, did not accept women at the time. Undeterred, Claudel studied at the nearby Académie Colarossi.The blossoming artist was introduced to Rodin when she was -years-old. Two years later she began working in his studio. Soon, Claudel and Rodin became involved, and their lives, as well as their work, became inextricably linked.L’Implorante was created around the same time her relationship with Rodin was coming to an end, and he ed to his long-term partner, Rose Beuret. It shows a naked, young woman kneeling on rocky ground, reaching forward with both arms, asattempting to grasp something or holding something invisible. Her face has a child-like expression, her lips are parted asshe is about to say something, and her eyebrows are furrowed, expressing sadness.The kneeling figure was first modelled as part of a larger, three-figure group, L’Âge Mûrin -, which depicts a middle-aged man being led away from the youthful figure shown in L’Implorante. This group sculpture is commonly acknowledged to depict a regretful Rodin being stolen away from the young Claudel by an aged Beuret.The reproduction rights for L’Implorante were acquired from Claudel by the publicist and editor Eugène Blot around . He arranged for the sculpture to be cast in two sizes: cm and .cm. It is believed only five of the larger size were produced, plus around  of the smaller versions. Today four of these are held in the collections of the Musée Rodin in France, Albert-Andre Museum in France, Fondation Pierre Gianadda in Switzerland and the politan Museum of Art in New York.The Burrell Collection’s European bronze sculptures centre around  works by Rodin, a grouping second only in size to the VA in the UK including the well-known and much-loved sculpture The Thinker.When Sir William was actively collecting Claudel would not have been considered an important artist. Although not obvious at the time, he purchased a work with very close connections to Claudel. The Rodin sculpture Brother and Sister borrows directly from a pre-existing work by Camille Claudel. It is sometimes even regarded as a collaboration between the two artists. This will also be on show when the refurbished museum reopens in March .Councillor David McDonald, Chair of Glasgow Le, said: “We are elated to acquire this piece by Camille Claudel and indebted to the Burrell Trustees, National Fund for Acquisitions, Art Fund, Henry Moore Foundation for their support in helping us secure this internationally important sculpture for The Burrell Collection.“Glasgow Le is proud to actively collect work by women artists and announcing acquisitions is a source of huge excitement, especially when it is the first of its kind in the UK. Until now Glasgow did not have a sculpture by Claudel. This piece bolsters the collection and connects well with other works that will be on show, most notably by Rodin.“We are certain it will be a draw for visitors, and it demonstrates the Burrell is not a static collection, but one that embraces change and responds to the world around it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"carnoustie-site-new-landmark-bank-scheme","story":"The development came as what is described as a \"landmark agreement\" was today reached between banks and cash providers to share services, ensuring long-term cash availability across the UK.The new hope for high-street banking, funded by the banking industry has come in the form of brand new multiple-banks-in-one hub hosted by the Post Office.Among the banks supporting the move is Edinburgh-based TSB that has either shut or is shutting over  bank branches across the UK over two year with Scotland the hardest hit.It is understood £m has been made available immediately, which could support  hubs across the UK - but with more money expected to be pumped as more are required.The collaboration, achieved through the Access to Cash Action Group , marks the beginning of what the body described as a \"long-term commitment\" to ensuring widespread cash and banking access for communities where services are limited.It comes after a successful shared banking hubs pilot in Cambuslang, Glasgow and Rochford, Essex as part of the Community Access to Cash Pilot programme.The Herald understands that Carnoustie is to be the first to benefit from the roll out of the bank hubs.A wave of TSB branch closures last year left Carnoustie without a single bank in the town.In October it emerged the Post Office said it would look at all options to keep a branch open on Carnoustie High Street - amidst concerns that the present services at a Spar store were to disappear early next year.Dundee-based operator CJ Langs lease on the shop expires in January.The Carnoustie branch was one of  TSB bank branches due to be axed in Scotland as part of an announcement made by Edinburgh-based TSB in January. It meant a cut of around  jobs despite appeals to save branches in remote and most deprived areas of Scotland.Last month TSB announced it was axing a further  bank branches next year, including nine in Scotland, putting  jobs in a new wave of cuts.The new bank hubs have emerged as it emerged that Scotland has seen more branches shut down in the past six years than have remain opened.A new analysis produced exclusively for the Herald on Sunday by the consumer organisation Which  has revealed that %of the  bank branches that existed in Scotland in  will have shut by early next year.The consumer organisation Which  has been urging banks to prove they can take effective action to stop people losing access to cash and valued bank services without adequate alternatives being ready to put in place - or pause their branch closure plans until the government legislates to protect cash.It comes as cash use has been in decline in recent years – a trend accelerated and exacerbated by the pandemic – with current use % below pre-Covid levels.But millions of people across the UK still use cash daily.Recent research from the Financial Conduct Authority found that, during the pandemic, % of UK adults have struggled to cope without access to bank branches and ATMs, while % suffered as more businesses stopped or encouraged customers to use contactless or digital payments.FCA research suggests that five million people remain dependent on cash.In January, research showed that over m Scots were refused payment with notes and coins during the pandemic, threatening the viability of the cash network.The CAG say that banks and consumer groups alike recognise the need to ensure that consumers and small businesses who need cash can continue to withdraw and deposit it.Under the new model, any community that faces the closure of a core cash service, such as a bank branch or ATM, will have its needs independently assessed by the overseers of the UKs main cash machine network, LINK - as CAG’s dedicated, coordinating body - for a suitable solution to be provided.LINK says it will commission services to meet the cash needs of the community as a whole – not just the customers or members of one bank or building society.Communities will also be able to request a review of their community’s needs from the summer of .LINK says it has already assessed most communities where closures have taken place over the past year.As a result it is pushing ahead with new services in , with announcements of further services to come in early .The banking hubs will be launched alongside a cashback without purchase scheme which is being rolled out to some  shops across Scotland by the end of the year in a bid to retain the publics right to access hard cash.The solution means consumers can make a cash withdrawal of up to £ and check their balance without needing to make a purchase Natalie Ceeney, chairman of CAG and the Community Access to Cash Pilots said: “I’m delighted that the industry is today committing to ensuring that the cash needs of consumers and small businesses up and down the UK will continue to be met.\"We know that demand for cash is declining, but we also know that it continues to play a vital part in the lives of at least  million people in the UK – including some of the most vulnerable in society.\"The community pilots have shown that there are many dferent ways to meet people’s cash needs. Informed by this experience, I’m confident that the new plan will lay the foundations for a positive future for cash access across the UK.”Data provided by LINK revealed that the number of ATMs dropped from , in November, , to , in September last year. There were  free-to-use cash machines across Scotland while , charged - meaning that in one in four of the nations ATMs you had to pay to get your money out.Caroline Abrahams charity director of Age UK said: \"This is arguably the most promising development weve yet seen in ensuring that older people can continue to access cash, which so many of them rely on as an essential part of their everyday lives. Its been great to be part of the Cash Action Group and we look forward to seeing the principles agreed by the Group translate into action across the country, and really starting to make a positive dference for many older people.\"Banks have signed up to the new approach and will contribute to funding from  onwards. But it was not immediately clear how much money was being committed and how many bank hubs were being rolled out.Those taking part include Barclays Bank UK plc, Danske Bank, HSBC UK Bank plc, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide Building Society, NatWest Group plc, Santander UK plc and TSB Bank plc.David Postings, chief executive of banking trade body UK Finance said: “The banking and finance industry is committed to maintaining access to cash for people who need it, when they need it.\"UK Finance is delighted to have played a key role in the work, which has led to today’s announcement of a collective commitment to meet the needs of both personal and business customers who rely on cash.\"With demand for cash projected to continue to decline, the way access to cash is provided will have to continue to evolve. This new approach, with an independent co-ordinating body at its heart, means that we now have a joined-up response to meeting communities’ cash needs well into the future.”John Howells, chief executive of LINK added: “Our relationship with cash is changing but the UK is not ready to be a cashless society and free access to cash remains vital for many consumers and communities. LINK is therefore delighted to take on such a key role working with the banks to ensure that the cash needs of communities continue to be met.”SNP MP Ronnie Cowan said - \"It is good the hear that Link and the major high street banks are working together to find constructive solutions when it has been identied that a bank closure would result in the loss of the last free to access ATM in the immediate area.\"Without a bank then we must consider the provision of an ATM either through a Post Office or other outlet andappropriate then a bank hub as per those already piloted must be considered.\""},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

It would almost be better to have a regulation and a furlough scheme.#Sharing doubts over what number of people and what premises they attended actually constituted a #party#, he added: #Given that it#s best according to the authorities to avoid party situations then from a business point of view, we need support.#We need some clarity followed by some support.#The BID chairman#s comments came as leaders of all four UK nations are set to meet to discuss the rising levels of the new Omicron iant of COVID-. Earlier this afternoon, Ms Sturgeon warned that “dficult decisions” might have to be made in “days to come” amid this “surge”. Aware of the potential economic and social impact that further pandemic restrictions might have, she said that a lot would depend onfinancial aid could be agreed with the UK treasury.In the wake of this announcement and in the anticipation of further developments in the coming days, both Orkney Islands Counciland NHS Orkney have said they are prepared to respond to any new or righter restrictions which may be announced.Asked to respond to the First Minister#s announcement, an OIC spokeswoman said:  #The council is continually assessing its response to the pandemic and holds fortnightly incident management team meetings.#It was highlighted in this morning#s meeting that more announcements were likely to be coming from the First Minister.#Now that these announcements have been made this afternoon, they will be considered by officers, including our Safety  Resilience team and where necessary urgent matters will be escalated to the Incident Management Team or Senior Management Team as required, to ensure that that the council continues to support the response to the pandemic quickly and effectively.#The situation is of course fast moving and members of the public should expect further updates in due course —  but meantime we urge all to take very regular lateral flow device tests and to follow the guidance in respect to hand hygiene, face coverings and social distancing.#In a joint statement, NHS Orkney#s chief executive Michael Dickson and director of public health Louise Wilson explained that the guidance around parties has already been in force within their staff since November.They said: #The rapidly changing national picture is to be expected as we begin to understand the Omicron iant.#The guidance issued last night by Public Health Scotland regarding deferring Christmas parties was already in place here at NHS Orkney, we asked all our staff to show caution around Christmas events and to consider alternatives to reduce risk in early November.#Additionally, we have reminded all staff to work from home wherever possible and of course we are all continuing with our regular lateral flow tests and have all mitigations in place.#As the First Minister stated “our best form of defence is vaccinations”, we’d encourage anyone who is yet to be vaccinated to get in touch with ourselves, you can do this by calling   . We are well underway with our vaccination boosters and aim to have all booster vaccines administered by the middle of January with all appointment letters out before Christmas.#From tomorrowall household contacts of confirmed cases, Omicron or not, need to isolate for  days regardless of vaccination status or a negative PCR result. Non-household contacts can end isolation after receiving a negative PCR resultdouble vaccinated and have no symptoms.#These changes to isolation for household contacts of COVID- will have an impact across the community, and NHS Orkney has robust business continuity plans to help us deliver our key services.

With three Tests coming up after this one, he will be ready to play his part in the rest of the series.”Chris Woakes was quiet in the previous Test but his superior batting and a strong showing with the pink ball at this ground four years ago, he looks to have made the cut. That means the final decision on matchday could come down to Stuart Broad versus Jack Leach again, the same poser England faced last week in Brisbane.Their decision to go with the spinner’s iety on that occasion proved isive, not least when he was clubbed for  runs in  overs, and Broad will be desperate to pick up his th cap this time.Everyone around the Australia camp – from local boy Travis Head, to pitch curator Damian Hough – has talked up the virtues of slow bowlers at the Adelaide Oval, but the temptation to reunite the Anderson-Broad axis could prove too compelling.“Jimmy and Stuart have prepped well leading into this Test. They worked hard at Brisbane and have been in good rhythm in the sessions we have had in Adelaide,” said Root.“To have two of our most experienced pairing ready to go for Adelaide, that is a real boost for us especially with the pink ball in play and the match under lights.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1639498324284.jpg--covid_19___tue_14th_december_figures.jpg?1639498324000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211214newscovid 19 tue 14th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Credit: Peter MorrisonDecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWhile it may seem a dramatic move by the Education Minister to call an end to the body which was initially formed to regulate the teaching professions in Northern Ireland, that the council will cease going forward will not come as a surprise.In the end, the Department had given the council numerous chances to put its house in order, but had simply run out of patience.Read MoreFailings: Schools north and south ‘suffering from a chronic lack of investment’Established in  by the EducationOrder, the premise seemed simple enough. Establish a register of teachers in Northern Ireland, oversee the regulation of the profession by providing advice on training, career development and performance management of teachers and oversee the standard of conduct, all to be funded by teacher subscriptions.It was to be run by professionals, for professionals, but in recent years has been anything but professional. Riddled with dys and bullying, leaving it unable to operate effectively, its chief executive himself told Stormont’s Education Committee in March that he was fearful in the short term over the Council’s ability to operate effectively.That month Education Minister Peter Weir set up a review after Chief Executive Sam Gallaher, who had been in the post since , painted a bleak picture of the Council he inherited, admitting that, in his opinion, some of the  members were only there to bring the organisation down.They have succeeded, but were helped as the body’s powers have been undermined by signicant gaps in legislation. It could only become involved in cases of gross misconduct and had no say on any other disciplinary matters which remained the remit of schools.Built to govern, but not given the remit to do so.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Thirteen members have resigned since . Allegations of bullying have been re, along with an inability to take decisions. In March, Mr Gallaher was unable to say there is no risk to children over the inability to adequately discipline teachers.There had been “a level of harassment” he admitted.But the complaints and allegations kept on coming, the infighting becoming an embarrassment to the profession and something more akin to the primary school playground.Twice the organisation was placed in special measures by the Department of Education, but having to oversee the body that was supposed to oversee became intolerable. The only thing members could agree on was that it just wasn’t working.Issues were compounded in August when it emerged the Council had fallen well behind in the registration of newly qualied teachers — almost  were left waiting for approval.In October Mr Gallaher wrote to the organisation’s council to inform them he would be standing down from his position in April .Broken beyond repair, the only sensible action was to rip it up and start again, but what replaces the Council must have the legal ability to govern, remove teachers who should not be teaching and give the profession the dignity it needs.Related topicsDepartment of HealthPeter WeirMore On Department of Health PremiumDUP’s Jim Wells taking packed lunch to Stormont after canteen ‘ban’ under Covid rulesCancellations and drop in trade leading to a ‘catastrophic impact# on hospitality sector, warns industry chiefWhat happens next : Potential threat of Omicron means jabs are as important as everSwann praises ‘herculean efforts’ amid plans to roll-out Covid booster jab to younger age groupsNew Lodge people denied easy access to walk-in testing: SFMost ReadNI Assembly backs mandatory Covid certication laws – How did your MLA vote Loyalist graffiti claiming ‘war is needed’ appears in Newtownards£k PPE pack sold by NI sweets firm to NHS fetches £ in auctionI saw death: Belfast newborn lay grey and ‘leless’ as mum waited for ambulance that never arrivedHow, when and where to get your Covid- booster jab in Northern Ireland this weekTop VideosPlayVideo: Funeral for -year-old Aaron Webb killed in Glenavy crash PlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!PlayBoris Johnson sets accelerated new year booster target in face of Omicron ‘tidal wave’Latest EducationAvoid last year’s chaos and act now, union tells Education Minister McIlveen over Omicron fearsFailings: Schools north and south ‘suffering from a chronic lack of investment’Northern Ireland’s General Teaching Council to be dissolved immediately due to ‘systemic failures’I fear for my friends under Taliban, says Tyrone man behind teacher training for Afghan girlsLevelling up: A plan that could help transform NI so that everyone could reap benefitsLatestVon der Leyen: Omicron will be dominant Covid iant in EU by mid-JanuaryJames Anderson keen to create good memories at AdelaideSupreme Court to rule on investigation into ‘hooded men’ caseStar Hobson social workers were duped, says babysitter as killer is sentencedMan arrested after one dead and others ‘unaccounted for’ in Reading fire,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I don’t expect a whip-round. It’s not the end of the world.“I never frequented the bar anyway, so it’s not a loss to me.”The Assembly Commission confirmed it had issued guidance to MLAs and that the requirements also applied to events held in the building.Following a Stormont debate yesterday that ided MLAs, the controversial regulations were passed by  votes to , with the DUP voting against.People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll abstained.People wishing to access nightclubs, pubs, restaurants and other licensed premises will need to provide proof of vaccination, a negative lateral flow test result or evidence of previous Covid infection. The scheme was introduced late last month with a two-week grace period to allow businesses to adjust to the requirements.South Down MLA Mr Wells said he took multiple Covid tests every week, using both lateral flow and PCR options.“I’m getting my PCR test [today]. I’m probably one of the most tested people in Northern Ireland,” he added yesterday.“If I produce evidence of that, that would entitle me to visit the Members’ Dining Room on Thursday or Friday.“I hadn’t that, so I couldn’t go then. I can’t use any of the catering in the building.“I was told that from December , this would be enforced at Stormont.”Mr Wells is still able to access other parts of the building, including the

rules.“Members and passholders are required by law to comply fully with the regulations and to assist Assembly Commission staff and contractors in their operation,” it added.It also said provisions were already in place for people who can show proof of medical exemption from vaccinations or participation in a clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine.Covid certication rules apply for entry to all large indoor and outdoor events, including concerts and sports.The outcome of yesterday’s debate, which overran from the previous evening, prompted Health Minister Robin Swann to plead for a unied message from the Executive and wider Assembly.“I would ask for those who seek ision over this issue to look to what we can achieve when we pull together rather than looking for further ision,” he said.“We tackle Covid as a united society in Northern Ireland, doing everything that we can and everything that we know works.”He also referred to comments made earlier this week by DUP First Minister Paul Givan, who warned that a “storming is coming” with the expected spread of the Omicron iant across Northern Ireland.“You are better preparing for a storm when it is not raining, rather than waiting until you are up to your knees in water,” Mr Swann told MLAs.“That is what these regulations, as part of a wider package, intend to do.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\"

That becomes a job, but there’s no compensation, and that person is not doing something to bring in revenue — it’s just a cost,” he argued.“That’s a shameful and embarrassing U-turn that reminds me of the grand prix on Sunday, although to arbitrarily change the rules at the last minute there did create something very exciting.”The Department of Health said: “The regulations were amended on Thursday afternoon, and the guidance was uploaded with revised language on Friday morning.“Hospitality sector representatives were briefed on the changes on Friday morning.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSimon Hamilton being congratulated by former DUP leader Peter Robinson on his appointment as Stormont Finance Minister in  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSimon Hamilton being congratulated by former DUP leader Peter Robinson on his appointment as Stormont Finance Minister in Traders are also worried about the prospect of further restrictions in the new year.Festive joy is in short supply, Mr Hamilton added.“Usually at this time of year you’re looking to a new year, to turn the page and be full of hope, and I just think a lot of businesses in those customer-facing sectors are coming into  and genuinely not knowing what they’re going to face, and that makes it dficult to plan... confidence is ebbing.“There is a great degree of worry out there. They’re worried, they’re weary and they’re wary about what the future might hold. They’ve been through a heck of a lot and it’s been a roller-coaster ride for them and many of them are finding it very, very dficult.”He says speculation about future restrictions from ministers and advisers can have an immediate impact on the mood in the city centre, leading to cancellations.Mr Hamilton doesn’t refer specically to Chief Medical Officer Michael McBride, who last month said restrictions in “certain environments and sectors” may be considered in the run-up to the festive season.He said: “There’s a lot of what I would consider to be damaging speculation around what may or may not come in.“The Executive must take decisions on the basis of what evidence it has, and it hasn’t been hugely helpful that there’s been a wide amount of speculation about what may be required now or in the future.“That has definitely impacted on trade and has definitely impacted on business confidence, and I don’t think sometimes there’s an appreciation of how weary business owners are and their staff whenever they hear that we may go through another period of restrictions.“It contrasts with the mood coming into the summer and early autumn when there were still dficulties, but there was a sense of optimism.“Unless there is a signicant amount of additional support coming from the Treasury, I don’t think the Executive has the capacity to properly compensate businesses.“This is a very careful balancing act for the Executive to take and I don’t think that they have the freedom to go much further in terms of what they are doing.“It would be grossly unfairthey were to go much furtherwithout compensating business for the inevitable damage to trading it would do.”He says the £m Shop Local scheme has been a welcome boost to the city centre and that the Chamber had championed the idea over a long period.But he acknowledges it has had some flaws, including its continued rollout over Christmas when much retail spending would have been taking place anyway.“I think that’s something we’re always looking for, things to be absolutely bang-on perfect,” he said.“But I think with the scale of the scheme it was always going to pose some dficulties in its implementation, and I do think those dficulties have in the grand scheme been quite small in the overall numbers.”The Chamber doesn’t yet know the level of cancellations of Christmas parties at Belfast venues over the last few weeks since the new Omicron iant was discovered and the prospects of new restrictions were raised.“Any conversation with hospitality, leisure or events tells me that it’s quite painful at the minute. At a time we thought we were moving to a better space, it’s unfortunately very reminiscent of some of the other periods, like this time last year or other times in the pandemic, where we’ve had very dficult conversations with people who are wondering what the heck they’re going to do,” he added.Askedhe regrets being away from the challenges of running a Stormont department during Covid-, he jokes: “Do you watch the news  I do, I read your newspaper and others, and I don’t miss it and I’m glad I am where I am.“I don’t look at anybody who is doing some of the jobs that I used to do and have anything other than a huge degree of admiration for them. I was in dferent challenging posts in dferent periods and there’s always perpetual crisis in Stormont of one kind or another.“It is incredibly dficult to govern in this place and I can only imagine how much more dficult it is to do it at the moment. I look at them and wish them well. I wish them luck or whatever, but I am only glad I am not one of them.”He says ato politics, perhaps even for a dferent party, isn’t on the cards.“It sounds like I’m not closing the door or ruling anything out, but one thing that le has taught me, and I’m old enough now to start making mental notes about lessons, you never rule anything out as you don’t know where le is going to go,” he said.“But that is a phase of my le that I feel is done. To say I thoroughly enjoyed it suggests that I enjoyed every single second, but I really did enjoy that period. It was an immense privilege to serve in those three departments — but I don’t see that as something I would want to do again.”Most ReadNI Assembly backs mandatory Covid certication laws – How did your MLA vote Loyalist graffiti claiming ‘war is needed’ appears in Newtownards£k PPE pack sold by NI sweets firm to NHS fetches £ in auctionI saw death: Belfast newborn lay grey and ‘leless’ as mum waited for ambulance that never arrivedHow, when and where to get your Covid- booster jab in Northern Ireland this weekTop VideosPlayVideo: Funeral for -year-old Aaron Webb killed in Glenavy crash PlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!PlayBoris Johnson sets accelerated new year booster target in face of Omicron ‘tidal wave’Latest CoronavirusDUP’s Jim Wells taking packed lunch to Stormont after canteen ‘ban’ under Covid rulesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageNI Assembly backs mandatory Covid certication laws – How did your MLA vote Avoid last year’s chaos and act now, union tells Education Minister McIlveen over Omicron fearsCancellations and drop in trade leading to a ‘catastrophic impact# on hospitality sector, warns industry chiefLatestLove Island’s Amy Hart makes plea for theatres to remain openBoris Johnson to face MPs following massive revolt against Covid plansLondon Underground drivers to strike at weekend in Night Tube disputeEnergy firms face stress tests to bolster supplier resilience under Ofgem plansVon der Leyen: Omicron will be dominant Covid iant in EU by mid-January,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The DUP was opposed and voted against it following the Stormont debate.During Monday’s sitting, the party’s Jim Wells said “what I’m going to say is going to be controversial”.He told the assembly that as far as he was aware he was only one of two members who was not vaccinated.“It does not make me someone who should be discriminated against, or shunned in public.”The South Down MLA repeated his objections to taking the current vaccines on offer in NI.Mr Wells said he was not anti-vaccine but would want to be at the door of the vaccine clinic the day that there is a vaccine I can take as he expressed personal concerns about those on offer in the UK.His party colleague DUP MLA Paul Frew said bringing in vaccine passports amounted to “coercion and discrimination”.Here’s how each MLA voted:Dr Steve Aiken AYEMr Andy Allen AYEMr Jim Allister NOMs Caoimhe Archibald AYEMs Kellie Armstrong AYEMs Clare Bailey AYEMrs Rosemary Barton AYEMr Doug Beattie MC AYEMr Roy Beggs AYEMr John Blair AYEMr Cathal Boylan AYEMr Maurice Bradley NOMs Paula Bradley NOMs Sinéad Bradley AYEMs Paula Bradshaw AYEMs Nicola Brogan AYEMr Keith Buchanan NOMr Thomas Buchanan NOMr Jonathan Buckley NOMs Joanne Bunting NOMr Robbie Butler AYEMrs Pam Cameron NOMr Gerry Carroll ABSTAINEDMr Pat Catney AYEMr Alan Chambers AYEMr Trevor Clarke NOMr Pádraig Delargy AYEMr Stewart Dickson AYEMs Linda Dillon AYEMrs Diane Dodds NOMs Jemma Dolan AYEMr Stephen Dunne NOMr Mark Durkan AYEMr Alex Easton NOMs Sinéad Ennis AYEMrs Deborah Erskine NOMs Ciara Ferguson AYEMs Órlaithí Flynn AYEMr Paul Frew NOMr Colm Gildernew AYEMs Deirdre Hargey AYEMr Harry Harvey NOMr David Hilditch NOMr William Humphrey NOMs Cara Hunter AYEMr William Irwin NOMr Declan Kearney AYEMrs Dolores Kelly AYEMr Gerry Kelly AYEMs Liz Kimmins AYEMrs Naomi Long AYEMr Trevor Lunn AYEMr Chris Lyttle AYEMr Declan McAleer AYEMr Daniel McCrossan AYEMr Patsy McGlone AYEMr Colin McGrath AYEMr Philip McGuigan AYEMr Maolíosa McHugh AYEMs Sinead McLaughlin AYEMr Justin McNulty AYEMs Nichola Mallon AYEMr Andrew Muir AYEMs Áine Murphy AYEMr Conor Murphy AYEMr Mike Nesbitt AYEMr Robin Newton NOMs Carál Ní Chuilín AYEMr John O#Dowd AYEMrs Michelle O#Neill AYEMr Matthew O#Toole AYEMiss Aisling Reilly AYEMr George Robinson NOMs Emma Rogan AYEMr Pat Sheehan AYEMs Emma Sheerin AYEMr Christopher Stalford NOMr John Stewart AYEMr Mervyn Storey NOMs Claire Sugden AYEMr Robin Swann AYEMr Peter Weir NOMr Jim Wells NOMiss Rachel Woods AYEMost ReadNI Assembly backs mandatory Covid certication laws – How did your MLA vote Loyalist graffiti claiming ‘war is needed’ appears in Newtownards£k PPE pack sold by NI sweets firm to NHS fetches £ in auctionI saw death: Belfast newborn lay grey and ‘leless’ as mum waited for ambulance that never arrivedHow, when and where to get your Covid- booster jab in Northern Ireland this weekTop VideosPlayVideo: Funeral for -year-old Aaron Webb killed in Glenavy crash PlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest CoronavirusDUP’s Jim Wells taking packed lunch to Stormont after canteen ‘ban’ under Covid rulesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageAvoid last year’s chaos and act now, union tells Education Minister McIlveen over Omicron fearsCancellations and drop in trade leading to a ‘catastrophic impact# on hospitality sector, warns industry chiefSwann rails at First Minister for U-turn on Covid passportsLatestLondon Underground drivers to strike at weekend in Night Tube disputeEnergy firms face stress tests to bolster supplier resilience under Ofgem plansVon der Leyen: Omicron will be dominant Covid iant in EU by mid-JanuaryJames Anderson keen to create good memories at AdelaideSupreme Court to rule on investigation into ‘hooded men’ case,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby.

For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Now, more than  years on, Marie-Claire revisited the project to see how Irish identity has changed. The book contains the personal reflections of  contributors from a iety of sectors, backgrounds and viewpoints on their identity and what it means to them to ‘be Irish, The contributions come from the ranks of the famous and not so famous, people at the centre of things and people at the margins, people who live in Ireland and those who live abroad, the Irish and not-Irish-but-interested. Contributors include Lisa McGee, playwright and writer of Derry GirlsDr Teresa Lambe, co-inventor of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine General Martin Dempsey, former chair- person of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the US Mervyn Gibson, Grand Secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Merlin Holland, Oscar Wilde’s only grandchild well-known broad- caster Eamonn HolmesNorthern Irish jockeyAP McCoy singer- songwriter Ryan McMullan Irish Olympian, Sonia O’Sullivan and many more. Speaking on the book and her decision to edit it now, Marie-Claire said: “Having both lived and travelled outside Ireland, I became aware of how strong the sense of identity was amongst the Irish. I was also conscious that change was sweeping across the Island of Ireland and I was curious to discover just how robust or fluid Irish identity was during this time of profound change.” “Above all, the reflections in the book show that there are many ways of being Irish. We can be Irish by birth, Irish by ancestry, Irish by geography, Irish and British, Irish by accident, Northern Irish, Irish by necessity, Irish and European, Irish by association, Irish by culture, Irish and American and Irish by choice. “The collection is a tribute to the honesty of the contributors, and I would like to record how much I appreciate their commitment. “It started as a passion project for me, a topic I was genuinely curious. “Themore I spoke with the dferent contributors and read their stories, the more I was convinced of the books signicance as a snapshot of Irish identity today. It was a real privilege to work on it, and a welcome distraction during lockdown.” She concluded: “Becoming a parent has made me think about what this book will look like for my own two children in  years time, and that was a big motivator for me.” The contributors were encouraged to be as open and honest as possible with the intention of the book being completely inclusive and non-judgmental. All were asked the same questions: What does Irish identity mean to you personally  Why do  million people worldwide embrace their Irish heritage  Are we navel-gazing  Or are there real changes in attitude taking place in Ireland and among the Irish worldwide  Published by Lfey Press,Being Irish:  views on Irish Identity, is availablefrom local independent bookshop Little Acorn Book Store on Foyle Street as well as all major bookstores and online.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Bookings will open December  as the large centre opens due to growing concerns over the Omricon iant. You can still receive vaccinations from your GP and local pharmacists. People will be encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Visit the Western Trustwebsite as of December  for updates on booking info:westerntrust.hscni.net western-trust-covid--information-updates covid--vaccination-programme  Alternatively you can book at a local participating chemist or pharmacy for first, second or booster vaccines. The Western Trust has issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. The Trust stated in a post: “The Chief Medical Officers have agreed that the COVID- Booster Programme should be accelerated to help deal with the Omicron Variant. We are therefore once again asking for your help and are calling all those staff who previously worked in our vaccination programme back to assist over the next three weeks. This includes Vaccinators, Administrators and Support Services staff. Our Chief Executive and Corporate Management Team have agreed that staff will be released back to support the vaccine programme, unless there are exceptional circumstances. We appreciate how important leave is and we will try to protect any leave already booked, but would appreciate any flexibility that staff may be able to give. The announcement comes as SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney, encouraged people across Derry to get their Covid- booster vaccine. Councillor Tierney said: “I would encourage everyone who is eligible to get their Covid- booster vaccine as soon as possible to protect themselves and those around them. With the renewed threat the Omicron iant is posing to our society, we need to do everything we can to increase our defences to the virus. I would also urge anyone yet to receive their first and second doses to take this opportunity to get vaccinated. “There will be a number of places throughout the Western Trust area where people can get their booster vaccine, including the Foyle Arena and Omagh Leisure Complex from Wednesday. Booster vaccinations can also be provided by your GP and local community pharmacy. People are being encouraged to book their appointment from Wednesday, but limited walk-ins will also be available. “Following the current Covid- guidelines, including getting vaccinated, using Covid certication, practising social distancing and washing our hands is the most effective way of keeping each other safe and preventing the need for further restrictions. Nobody wants to see another lockdown, particularly so close to Christmas, and we all need to pull together, get vaccinated and help each other through this dficult period.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Bookings will open December  as the large centre opens due to growing concerns over the Omricon iant. You can still receive vaccinations from your GP and local pharmacists. People will be encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Visit the Western Trustwebsite as of December  for updates on booking info:westerntrust.hscni.net western-trust-covid--information-updates covid--vaccination-programme  Alternatively you can book at a local participating chemist or pharmacy for first, second or booster vaccines. The Western Trust has issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. The Trust stated in a post: “The Chief Medical Officers have agreed that the COVID- Booster Programme should be accelerated to help deal with the Omicron Variant. We are therefore once again asking for your help and are calling all those staff who previously worked in our vaccination programme back to assist over the next three weeks. This includes Vaccinators, Administrators and Support Services staff. Our Chief Executive and Corporate Management Team have agreed that staff will be released back to support the vaccine programme, unless there are exceptional circumstances. We appreciate how important leave is and we will try to protect any leave already booked, but would appreciate any flexibility that staff may be able to give. The announcement comes as SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney, encouraged people across Derry to get their Covid- booster vaccine. Councillor Tierney said: “I would encourage everyone who is eligible to get their Covid- booster vaccine as soon as possible to protect themselves and those around them. With the renewed threat the Omicron iant is posing to our society, we need to do everything we can to increase our defences to the virus. I would also urge anyone yet to receive their first and second doses to take this opportunity to get vaccinated. “There will be a number of places throughout the Western Trust area where people can get their booster vaccine, including the Foyle Arena and Omagh Leisure Complex from Wednesday. Booster vaccinations can also be provided by your GP and local community pharmacy. People are being encouraged to book their appointment from Wednesday, but limited walk-ins will also be available. “Following the current Covid- guidelines, including getting vaccinated, using Covid certication, practising social distancing and washing our hands is the most effective way of keeping each other safe and preventing the need for further restrictions. Nobody wants to see another lockdown, particularly so close to Christmas, and we all need to pull together, get vaccinated and help each other through this dficult period.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Paacutedraig Delargy said: “We need to see major investment to improve rails services and connections in the North West of this island. “Linking up all rail services on an all-island basis presents huge opportunities to grow the economy and create jobs, particularly along the Western Corridor linking Derry to Sligo and Galway and delivering a faster train service to the capital in Dublin. “This would help unlock Derry’s potential, promote regional equality and connect us to the rest of this island with major benefits for workers and commuters. “Alongside this, delivering first-class public transport and investing in our rail lines can help tackle the climate emergency and reduce carbon emissions. That should be the focus of transport ministers, North and South. I would encourage people to take part in the consultation. The deadline to take part in this consultation is Friday, January .

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The SDLP published their energy costs action plan last week and Mr Durkan called for a payment of up to pound, to be extended to all households in receipt of Universal Credit. The payment would help families top up their gas cards and fill their oil tanks so that they would be able to heat their homes over the winter without worrying about how to pay for it. Mr Durkan said: “Given the steep rise in energy bills over the last few months there are families across the North struggling to heat their homes this winter. “In the absence of any action from the Joint First Ministers or Minister Hargey to mitigate the situation the SDLP has produced a number of proposals in our energy costs action plan to try and help people through this very dficult period. “While energy bills are increasing by hundreds of pounds a year, Universal Credit claimants, who are already struggling to get by, have seen their payments cruelly cut by pound a week by the Tory government and waved through by Sinn Feacutein. “These people were barely able to cover their bills before the recent price hikes and I cannot see how they will able to meet these massive costs. “In an attempt to help the people who really need it I’m calling for the winter fuel payment, a modest payment of up to pound, to be extended to all households in receipt of Universal Credit. “This money will allow families to top up their gas cards and fill their oil tanks to get them through this winter, then we can focus on tackling the long-term issues around fuel poverty. “I’m also calling on the Department for Communities to work with the Department for Health to explore how families with children with disabilities can be supported to cope with rising energy costs. “It’s disgraceful that we are already in the grip of winter and no plan has been forthcoming to help low income families deal with these mounting issues. “I will continue lobbying Minister Hargey and doing all I can to secure immediate support for the people who need it most.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

As part of his tour, the Mayor visited businesses in the heart of the city centre, including the Craft Village and in the Waterside. He also visited businesses in the outskirts of town at Maydown and in Eglinton and later in the week spent time with traders in Strabane. This past  months have been an extremely challenging time for local businesses, and Derry City  Strabane District Council is keen to inspire confidence among the public by encouraging them to shop local.

Cllr Harkin said the city of Derry should be proud of the workers for standing firm and stated that industrial action could easily have been avoided by the two employers. And Cllr Harkin expressed his hopes that both employers can learn from this dispute and move on and not to victimise employees who are UNITE trade union members for the action they were forced to take. He said: “We commend Derry dockers for staying strong and winning their demands following strike action. They should be proud of what they achieved. Everyone in the city should be proud of the dockers victory. “By staying united and braving freezing weather on the picket line, UNITE members at Burke Shipping Services and Foyle Port made gains on pay parity and a wage increase. “This was a strike that should never have been necessary. The demands made by workers were very modest but employer intransigence gave them no option but to take action. “The attempt to portray workers negatively by employers raises serious questions about public accountability when Council support is sought to become a Free Port. “It also raises questions about Derry City and Strabane Councillors having paid positions as part of the Foyle Port Commission. “People Before Profit activists were on the picket line everyday of the strike and we successfully put forward a motion winning the Council to take a clear-cut position in support of the strike and trade union demands. “We will be demanding the Council make clear there should be no victimisation of workers and the trade union following the end of the dispute. “Dockers and other workers have been told throughout the pandemic that they play a critical role as key, frontline and essential workers. “Trade unions are now demanding this is translated into improved wages and conditions for workers across all sectors. “That employers and the Stormont Executive arent automatically backing these demands points up the problem of an economy catering to elites where the gap between the least well-off and those at the top has skyrocketed. “Workers across Derry, across the North and across Ireland should take confidence and example from the resilience of Foyle Port dockers. “This is what will need to happenwe are to ensure health workers, Council workers, Education support workers and all others begin to be treated with dignity, respect and more economic equality. “No one should be told they should wait for better days - this is the time to use solidarity and action to challenge poverty pay.” UNITE General Secretary, Sharon Graham, added: “This is a tremendous win for our members. “Having endured freezing cold and driving rain on long days on picket lines, the workers stood ready to escalate their strike action but their determination led to both employers making offers which met their demands in full. “This is a good news story for workers everywhere in Northern Ireland and shows that there is a power in our union. “It confirms yet again that when our members fight in unity for their jobs, pay and conditions they can win.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain. Kevin travelled to Istanbul last month to meet a specialist and will require surgery within a matter of months, which will cost in the region of pound,.

On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

Photo by Piaras Oacute Miacutedheach SportsfileReporter: Chris McNulty Dec   addthis, Georgie Kelly has informed Bohemians that he will be making his exit from the League of Ireland. googletag.cmd.push Kelly, who scored  goals in all competition in , is courting plenty of interest from abroad. The Tooban native was named as the PFAI Player of the Year and will make a move out of the League of Ireland for . Clubs in England and Scotland are chasing Kelly’s signature, but there has been contact from other counties that have piqued his interest. Derry City were keen on Kelly, whose time in the League of Ireland began in the Candystripes before he moved to UCD. but the payer will not be staying on home soil. Central to Kelly’s decision regarding his next destination will be the ability to complete a Masters in Renewable Energy and Environmental Finance, which he is undertaking with the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School. He recently told Donegal Live: “I don’t really know what’ll happen next year. It’ll depend on options, being honest. “I wouldn’t jump at the chance to play in League Two or in Scotland, just to get that move. A lot of players are itching to get away and get the feel of that level. I would be a bit more hesitant because I have the Masters to finish. “For others, it’s their le and it matters more to them. It depends on what comes up for me and what opportunities are there for me.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Clubs in England and Scotland are chasing Kelly’s signature, but there has been contact from other counties that have piqued his interest. Derry City were keen on Kelly, whose time in the League of Ireland began in the Candystripes before he moved to UCD. but the payer will not be staying on home soil.

He recently told Donegal Live: “I don’t really know what’ll happen next year. It’ll depend on options, being honest. “I wouldn’t jump at the chance to play in League Two or in Scotland, just to get that move. A lot of players are itching to get away and get the feel of that level. I would be a bit more hesitant because I have the Masters to finish. “For others, it’s their le and it matters more to them. It depends on what comes up for me and what opportunities are there for me.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Inpho Photography.Reporter: Daragh Ó Conchúir Dec Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, All-Ireland senior camogie semi-final Slaughtneil - googletag.cmd.push Oulart-the-Ballagh- First-half goals from Wexford legends Uacutena Leacy and Ursual Jacob and eight points from play by the Kehoe twins, Shelley and Stacey, ended Slaughtneil’s bid for a fth consecutive AIB All-Ireland senior club camogie final appearance, as  champions Oulart-The Ballagh held the former three-in-a-row victors at arm’sin the second half to prevail at Donaghmore Ashbourne by - to -. Oulart have another giant to slay in next Saturday’s decider at Nowlan Park as titleholders Sarsfields lie in wait following their - to - victory over Drom  Inch yesterday. On this evidence, they look more than capable of doing so, their wealth of experience and scoring power capable of accounting for any outfit on a going day, with apart from the aforementioned, the likes of skipper and another ex-Model County hero Mary Leacy, Ciara Storey, Anais Curran and Aideen Brennan all involved. A ruthless first-half showing with the wind laid the groundwork for the victors, as it forced their Derry opponents to discard their tried and trusted system of restriction. This meant that even as they had the elements in the second half, more gaps existed than they would normally allow and they were capitalised upon by Oulart. Given the final margin, the opening nine minutes were hugely signicant, at the end of which the red and blacks led by - to -. After Shauna Sinnott pointed almost from the throw-in, Stacey Kehoe and Jacob slotted a pair apiece before Uacutena Leacy planted just the latest in a career of major goals, making no mistake after Shelley Kehoe drew the cover with a run through the middle. Former Offaly star Tina Bradley, who gave birth to her first child earlier this year, slotted a couple of minors for Slaughtneill as they steadied the ship and added a third after winning a free from which Louise Dougan converted to leave it - to - at the first water break.

Cliodhna Niacute Mhianaacutein reduced the margin to a goal but catastrophe struck when following Shelley Kehoe’s point, Jacob’s free from m was deflected unfortunately by Dougan beyond Jolene Bradley to put seven between them once more. That margin had grown to ten by the interval and the Robert Emmets never looked like reeling it in from - to -. They tried valiantly, as you would expect however, Therese Mallon goaling in the first minute of the second half after a block by Ceacuteat McEldowney of Katie Gallagher’s attempted clearance. Orla McNeill followed quickly with a point but the Oulart riposte was notable, Uacutena Leacy, Shauna Sinnott and Shelley Kehoe firing the last three points of the third quarter to make it - to -. They only had to avoid a collapse from that juncture and with such experience in their ranks, that was never going to happen. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis. Council officials have agreed to replace surface safety tiles at our play parks and I hope this programme will continue to be rolled out, he said.Cllr Sharvin said that following the recent workshop, council officers are to compile a report which will be discussed by councillors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"District’s battering from Storm Barra  ","story":"DOWN District was pummelled by Storm Barra yesterday with gale force winds and driving rain coinciding with a spring high tide to wreak havoc.Thunder and lightning was added into the heady weather mix with the storm conditions bringing down a number of trees along the coastline.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed.

However, the Magpies led by four on referee Niall Cullenrsquos short whistle.Ramor came out after the break and pressed high, and were rewarded with three scores in the first five minutes.Kilcoo didnrsquot panic and upped the ante immediately with two Paul Devlin frees settling things. Jerome Johnston and Eugene Branagan kept the scoreboard ticking and on the th minute the brilliant Ceilum Doherty found the net after great approach play by Dylan Ward.From here to the end, Kilcoo kept playing with that high tempo and the game was put beyond the Virginia men with six minutes remaining when man of the match Jerome Johnston found the net once again.Both sides emptied their benches as the game petered out, as the Down men came away with an impressive win.Mickey Moran and his management team will take great heart from many aspects of their teamrsquos performance and will know only too well it will take this and morethey are to win against the Derry champions and reach back-to-back Ulster finals.Kilcoo assistant manager Conleith Gilligan expressed mixed emotions as the local side look ahead to the semi-final stage.ldquoThere was definitely some nice passages of play and, look, we were able to play the game at our own pace and as the competition goes on that wonrsquot be allowed to happen, he said.ldquoOnce we got our legs moving, up to the first water-break we did very well. It was just that second quarter where we were on top but we didnrsquot take enough chances that would have put the game to bed and we allowed Ramor to live in the game right up to half-time.He added: ldquoWe didnrsquot need to be the best in the country tonight, we just needed to be better than Ramor and I think we were.Kilcoo: N Kane, N Branagan, R McEvoy , A Branagan, M Rooney, Anthony Morgan , E Branagan , D Ward , Aaron Morgan, C Doherty , J Johnston , S Johnston , C Laverty, R Johnston, P Devlin .Subs used: A Branagan, T Fettes, M Hynes, C Rooney and J Clarke.Ramor United: L Brady D Bartley, B OrsquoConnell, E Somerville A OrsquoConnell, Jack Brady, M Magee, L Caffrey, E Maguire B Smith, S Cadden, C MaguireJames Brady , A Cole, S McEvoy .Subs used: G Mannion, K Maguire, P McNamee , J Bradley and L Lynch.Referee: Niall Cullen ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"New £65m Lidl supermarket in Carryduff gets green light  ","story":"THE green light has been given for the multi-million pound regeneration of the Carryduff shopping centre which could create  new jobs.The ambitious plan designed to transform the Church Road site mdash which includes a new pound.m Lidl store mdash was approved by Lisburn and Castlereagh Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Monday.Lidl submitted its new store planning application earlier this year and hopes to open the , square metre facility, creating  new jobs and parking spaces for  vehicles, by the middle of next year.In addition to the Lidl store, an additional , square metres of floorspace is available for other retailers at the expansive centre site.The new store opening is a major part of the shopping centrersquos regeneration, which has lain derelict for more than four years, with the planning application proposing the demolition of the existing buildings and the erection of three retail units, cafe, bookmakers, drive through cafe, landscaping and associated site works.Parking provision for disabled drivers is included in the development proposal alongside dedicated spaces for parents and children. Four dedicated spaces for electrical vehicles are also included.Itrsquos understood that in addition to the  jobs in the new Lidl store, a further  will be created across the other proposed retail units, with  jobs created during construction and development.Council planners are recommending to members that the application be approved with  conditions including its full construction within a five-year period.In papers submitted ahead of Mondayrsquos planning meeting, planners said they were recommending approval as the proposed retail use is considered to comply with the local development plan.They say that when the buildings are constructed, they will not adversely impact on the character of the area or have a detrimental impact on the amenity of existing residents in properties adjoining the site.ldquoAppropriate provision is made to meet the needs of cyclists and adequate facilities are made for shower and changing facilities as required for such a major employment-generating development, the papers point out.A spokesperson for Lidl said the poundm store would reflect the retailerrsquos concept design, boasting a sales floor, a shopping environment withspacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms and baby-changing facilities, as well as a bakery offering and staff facilities.ldquoOur ambitious plans to complement the site with additional retail and leisure units represent an investment of more than pound million into the area and the support of more than  jobs, he said.ldquoWersquore proud to be part of the centrersquos signicant regeneration and bring a new future of growth to the locality whilst honouring the sitersquos historical connections to the community.The spokesman added: ldquoWe hope to receive planning permission for the site and look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store early next year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.Carryduff shopping centre was a prime retail destination for many years, but since the closure of its flagship Supervalu store in , it struggled to attract an anchor tenant that would drive its growth.The formal planning application by Lidl follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in February which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community.Lidl acquired the . acre Carryduff shopping centre site in August last year as part of the retailerrsquos plans to expand its store presence across the region to more than  stores by the end of the decade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Newcastle harbour development plans  ","story":"THE redevelopment of the former generator house at Newcastle harbour has the potential to act as a catalyst to secure additional investment.Thatrsquos the assertion of Mournes councillor Willie Clarke whose comment came after Monday eveningrsquos annual meeting of the Newcastle Harbour Heritage Association.He congratulated the grouprsquos chairman Campbell Miller and the committee members on the ldquofantastic positive contribution they have made in improving the harbour over the past year.Cllr Clarke said the two main items discussed at the annual meeting included the refurbishment of the former generator house as a community hub and the provision of a new boarding pontoon that would allow disabled people to board vessels, something which he said is long overdue.The business case for the new floating pontoon recently passed through Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.Cllr Clarke explained the vision for the generator house includes the provision of showers, toilets, and changing facilities for water-based recreation, alongside a meeting room for the community and harbour users.He said the business case was submitted to the local authority and approved through the so-called community transfer process.ldquoIt is essential that this building is refurbished for the local community which will be a catalyst in the development of the harbour, suggested Cllr Clarke.ldquoIn addition, it offers an excellent opportunity for the local council and the harbour community to develop a partnership to create a community hub for the area.

McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

Jimmyrsquos  is scheduled to take place on Sunday, March , and it is anticipated that interest will be high especially given that the Seeley Cup sold out well in advance.The Joe Seeley offers a flat and fast course starting on the Ormeau Embankment in Belfast with two and a bit laps through the Ormeau Park.For those watching or racing it was a sharp cold day, but miraculously the heavy rain and high winds that preceded the .pm start died down just in time to let the runners have a fair crack at a good performance.At the pointy end there were small clusters of runners who made a break early on in the first lap and then a lead group of five formed as they headed out for the second lap. The huddle of five then broke apart in the last K as they hurtled towards the finish line in break neck speed.Overall winner Owen Everardonly edged for glory in the last two strides as right to the mat it was not clear who would breach the tape first.His time of . was two seconds ahead of Matthew Neill , who was one second ahead of third-placed Eskander Turki . The top  competitors were all sub  minutes for K, which is fast by any means.East Down ACrsquos Neil McCartan, who prefers shorter distances and would choose track over road running, finished in a commendable ..

Good work by all three.Cross-countryThe Robinson brothers, Oliver and Alex, ended off their  cross-country season with a trip to the Uneven Age Group All Irelands Cross Country in Gowran, Kilkenny, on Sunday.The sun shone all day but the temperature stayed low with the ground remaining icy in parts. Alex had gained his Ulster U- team place by coming sixth at the Ulster  NI race in Donegal a few weeks previously, so he had set his expectations high.His race was ,m around a very twisty course through long grass, all of which made it more technical than previous races.The start of any cross-country race is hectic with lots of jostling and this was no exception.Alex was pulled back when the gun went off and then had to contend with some fallers so he never really got into his stride.He was disappointed to place th out of a field of  runners, but deserves huge credit for his commitment over the last few months.Alexrsquos older brother, Oliver, was running for the Down team in the U- race.

In my opinion, such an appointment is crucial and could benefit the town and the business community a great deal.ldquoThe night time economy is one area that needs to be improved not only in Downpatrick but where, but rapid progress this in the current Covid climate may not be possible.ldquoHowever, there is no reason why ideas to regenerate our night time economy cannot be discussed now to lay plans for the future, he continued.Cllr Curran said every high street is dferent, with many people keen to see them become vibrant shopping hubs at the heart of local communities, explaining that the work of the Stormont task force could not be more timely.He added: ldquoAnything that can be done to increase footfall in our town centres in the future will be more than welcome.The call for evidence document is available at https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk consultations call-evidence-high-street-task-force, while responses to the call for evidence can be made to highstreet@communities-ni.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13163110.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I’m looking for opportunities to boost trade in key areas such as digital, services and agriculture, as well as discussing ways our world-class professionals, such as engineers or lawyers, can offer their services more easily in the US.Starting in Calornia, my journey takes in Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Oklahoma, with a pitstop in Belfast’s twin city, Nashville, to take in some of Tennessee’s famous country music.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Penny Mordaunt with Lori Odom, vie-president of International Business for the Nashville Area Chamber of CommerceI’m championing Northern Ireland’s top-quality goods and services and making the case for why it’s a great destination for investors looking for the next big opportunity.Northern Ireland’s trade and investment relationship with the US is already one of the strongest in the UK, with big American companies like Citi, Spirit AeroSystems and Allstate continuing to grow their presence in the area.It’s a fact that Northern Ireland has seen the largest percentage increase in employment in US-owned UK businesses outside London and the South East, rising three-fold between  and .It’s also the number one international investment location for US cybersecurity development projects.Today, there are more than  US-owned businesses in Northern Ireland employing some , people.Cognizant, a digital IT services company headquartered in New Jersey, recently announced plans to create another , jobs over the next four years, with new delivery centres in Leeds and Northern Ireland.Digital transformation consulting firm, PA Consulting is also expanding its operations in the region with a new digital centre in Belfast.US enthusiasm for Northern Ireland isn’t limited to investment, though.Last year, America snapped up goods worth £ million, or nearly % of NI’s total exports. Among the firms to have capitalised is Ulster Carpets, which has offices in America and sees the US market as pivotal to its international strategy. Of course, it’s not just goods that Northern Ireland is successfully selling to the US.Thanks to the global reach of shows like HBO’s smash hit Game of Thrones, Northern Ireland’s production landscape has enjoyed a huge boost. Paper Owl Films, based in Hollywood, says the show raised the profile of the entire Northern Ireland creative industries sector for film and TV.SixteenSouth is further testament to this the Belfast-based BAFTA-winning animation studio with over  international accolades has attracted global stars to voice characters in its shows, including Tennessee’s very own Dolly Parton.So, whilst transatlantic trade remains strong, there is always more we can do. That’s why we recently launched our ‘Made in the UK, Sold to the World’ plan to help businesses across Northern Ireland unleash their export potential and start selling their world-class products to the US and beyond.No matter what stage of their export journey they are at, businesses can access government support via the Export Support Service, a one-stop shop for exporting advice.As part of this, we’ve also launched a new UK Tradeshow Programme to help businesses across all parts of the UK attend more events and tradeshows to promote their products around the world.With the expansion of DIT’s Export Academy to SMEs in Northern Ireland and the launch of Trade and Investment Northern Ireland, there’s never been a better time for businesses in Northern Ireland to start exporting. In fact, research shows that companies that export their goods are % more productive than those that don’t. The International Trade Secretary was in Northern Ireland last month, hosting the Board of Trade in Derry Londonderry and encouraging businesses right across the region to take advantage of the support on offer. As we continue to break down more trade barriers, cut red tape and make it easier for UK companies to trade abroad, I can’t wait to see more businesses capitalising on the enormous opportunities that the US has to offer.– Penny Mordaunt is UK Minister for Trade PolicyFor more opinion on everything from Gerry Adams to the national anthem, visit this link: www.newsletter news opinion——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Clockwise from top left, David Lloyd George Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, , Winston Churchill, Robert Barton, Michael Collins, Arthur GrfithLock it up carefully”, David Lloyd George said to his mistress and secretary, Frances Stevenson, in her room at  Downing Street, as he handed her the British copy of the historic Anglo-Irish Treaty just before  am on  December .Under its terms the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, as created by Pitt the Younger  years earlier, came to an end. Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

This does not change the current restrictions in place in Wales, which currently remains at alert level zero.Dr Atherton also said that the initial peak of the omicron iant was predicted to be around January or February - but rates are rising quicker than expected.“When I first heard about omicron, I thought it would be a problem in January and February. With these transmission rates we are far more likely to see a problem running into the Christmas period and then into early January. So that is why we felt the need to raise the alert level,” he said.He also highlighted things that people in Wales can do to help minimise the spread.He said: “It is unpalatable at this time of year to say this, but we need to think about contacts we are having because we know that this virus loves to transmit from person to person and we cannot afford to have large gatherings at this time of year because it will bring community transmission that we are fearful of.”He also highlighted the importance of the boosters and having the booster when people are called for. “We are seeing quite signicant numbers of people have been contacting the NHS to say they have got an appointment for their booster but are going to delay it and asking for another appointment,” he said..removeMORE NEWS:“That implies people aren’t prioritising it and that is natural when it is Christmas time and people are thinking about other things.\"What we are now saying is you cannot think about anything more important than getting your booster because we know that the vaccine effectiveness is reduced a bit but the protection with booster shots against serious harm is still about  per cent and so the best thing, we can do for ourselves, and our loved ones is to get your booster shots when you are eligible.”Dr Atherton explained that, although the Welsh Government had set a target of offering everyone in Wales aged  and over a booster jab by the end of January, they are working through to bring this forward. He said how there has been work over the weekend to increase this rollout and this could include walk-in clinics, extra vaccination clinics and more volunteers to allow for more vaccines to be administered quicker.He also advised that the rollout will prioritise the elderly and vulnerable first and that everyone over  should have received their invitation for a booster shot. Those who have not should contact their health board. Everyone  over the age of  should wait until they are contacted.He also confirmed that those who are housebound will be able to receive their boosters and that GPs have been given more money to prioritise these. Anyone over  who has not received and invite should contact the relevant health board.Dr Atherton said that, although there are only  cases of the omicron iant in Wales, he expects community transmission is on the rise as seen across the UK and in other nations. It was confirmed this morning by health minister Eluned Morgan that one person in Wales was in hospital with the omicron iant.Dr Atherton said: “It is inevitable as community transmission rises, two weeks later there will be a rise in people needing hospital treatment and needing oxygen and ITU treatment. And two weeks later sadly, a rise in deaths.”He added that decisions around introducing more restrictions were up to the ministers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAndrew RT Davies, Senedd Member for South Wales Central, is supporting the campaign to save Bute Cottage Nursery School.The Vale of Glamorgan Council plans to merge the nursery with Evenlode Primary School – which leads campaigners to believe that the site, which has extensive outdoor areas with many teaching and learning provisions including a chicken coop, summer house, sand pit, pirate ship and another outdoor house, could close for good.Campaigners – more than , have signed a petition against the merger – also feel that the nursery will lose its name, identity and independent governance. Currently with the independent governance, children lead their own learning with support from their experienced nursery teachers.The plans would change the lowest age of pupils at Evenlode from four years old to three, and would add  part-time nursery places to the primary school. Bute Cottage would be discontinued, and staff and pupils would transfer to the primary school by September next year.Laura Windeatt, who launched the petition, said: “This proposal is the start of a slippery slope, starting with Bute Cottage losing its name and identity and ending with its closure and the loss of an environment we should all be determined to preserve.“The loss of Bute Cottage would be signicant to the Vale’s community and felt deeply by the generations of ‘Buties’ across the years, not to mention the future generations who would miss out on such an enriching and inspiring start to their education.“On paper, a single site may at first glance seem practical, especially at such a good, reputable school as Evenlode, but those who know Bute Cottage know that losing it would be a travesty. Bute Cottage is a gem in the heart of the Vale of Glamorgan — one that we should vehemently protect.”MORE NEWS:Mr Davies said: “I do not want to see the merging of Bute Cottage and Evenlode but,that were to happen, it would be even more devastating to see the Bute Lane site close.“It’s important that the Vale Council puts this issue to bed and categorically rules out closing the Bute Lane site of the Bute Cottage Nursery. The facilities at Bute Lane are superb, and perfectly facilitate the pupil-led learning that is implemented at Bute Cottage.“The staff and governors at Bute Cottage have developed a unique identity and learning experience for their pupils.“Their pupil-led learning philosophy is something that should be protected and not lost in a merger with another school with dferent values.The Vale of Glamorgan Council is currently working on going through the consultation responses ready for the full cabinet to make a decision.https:www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-bute-cottage-nursery-schoolGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said tidal energy in the Severn estuary could provide as much as seven per cent of the total energy needed across the UK.He said: “The UK government has so far refused to support a scheme due to a perceived requirement for high levels of public investment and concerns over the environmental impact on designated areas in the Severn estuary.“However, the changing landscape of the climate emergency, energy insecurity, rising costs, and rapid technological improvements indicate that many of these policy, cost and environmental barriers may no longer be as signicant. We want to find out what could be done to harness this incredible energy resource.”In October the group revealed it was setting up a new commission to explore building a barrage across the estuary, as well as exploring other options for tidal energy. A barrage had previously been looked at in depth about a decade ago but ultimately dropped as it was seen as too expensive and harmful to the environment.Regional groups such as the Western Gateway, and the more established Northern Powerhouse, are considered key in attracting huge levels of investment needed for major infrastructure projects, like improving the railways, as well as foreign direct investment..removeSpending per person on infrastructure construction is about  per cent higher in the Northern Powerhouse than across the Western Gateway region, Cllr Thomas said, without including the benefits from HS.He added: “HS represents a signicant improvement in connectivity across other parts of the country, putting the Western Gateway at risk of becoming worse off. South Wales and the west of England have not enjoyed the levels of rail enhancement investment experienced where in the UK over the past  years.“This underinvestment has led to relatively less attractive services, attracting fewer passengers, and leading to higher subsidies compared to the rest of the UK.“HS will put Cardf and south Wales at a signicant disadvantage. While the UK economy is predicted to receive a £ billion benefit from HS, south Wales’s GDP will lose an estimated £ million per year. There are similar negative impacts for the southwest of England, with Bristol losing £ million per year, and Gloucester, Bath and northeast Somerset another £ million annually.”To counter this, the Western Gateway is seeking investment for a range of railway upgrades. These include upgrading the South Wales Mainline and Great Western Mainline, running from Swansea through Cardf, Bristol and eventually leading to Heathrow and London.

Feeding, grooming, behavioural training, healthcare requirements, and an abundance of love and care are all signicant considerations before getting a pet.USPCA Chief Executive Brendan MullanUSPCA Chief Executive, Brendan Mullan, said, “For the USPCA this is unfortunately something we come up against each year, as there is a seasonal demand for young animals such as puppies or kittens. Under no circumstances should a pet be taken in on a whim or as a surprise – these decisions, rooted in impulse, are unfortunately the actions that can cause animals to sufferthey do not receive the care they need.“We encourage the public not to get a pet in haste ahead of Christmas and instead give careful consideration to what responsible pet ownership involves andthey can fulfil their pet’s needs. Pets have such a wonderful impact on our lives through love and companionship, so it’s only right that we ensure we can reciprocate that, giving them a happy and healthy le.“If, after much research, you decide a pet is the right choice for you, the USPCA is urging the public to be vigilant against illegal breeders. Unfortunately, there will be iniduals ready to take advantage of people wishing to get a pup. Illegal breeders are motivated by one thing and one thing only – greed – they have no concerns for the welfare of your potential pup.“The conditions in which these pups are raised are appalling, from overbred bitches, used and abused for profit, to the cramped and disease-ridden enclosures. No matter the temptation, please do not engage with these iniduals. The message is out there, but we now need the public to take heed – we all have a vital role to play in helping end this horric practice, otherwise it will remain a vicious cycle of cruelty and suffering.”Very often legitimate breeders will closely assess your suitability to the puppy’s requirements. The USPCA has also highlighted how illegal breeders are taking advantage of the Covid- pandemic to avoid thorough checks of pups and the environment they were reared in. To protect yourself from the callous actions of such iniduals, consider the following: Rehome a pet from the USPCA or local animal rescue instead Always see a puppy with its mother and litter Don’t buy a pet from a car boot, the back of a van or a market stall Never agree to the suggestion of a ‘helpful’ meeting point Askthe person is a registered commercial breeder,so record the number from the Local Authority Registration document Enquire about the pup’s health status including worming and parasites, inoculations etc Get veriable veterinary confirmation Obtain a proper receipt.Northern IrelandUSPCAPets  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularDrink driver apprehended in Ballyclare...NewsPortadown killer Garfield Beattie has jail sentence, for sen...NewsPolice warn over ‘morning after’...NewsPermanent memorial to highlight Carrick family’s remarkable ...NewsMissing: Police searching for four-year-old Malachi McCready...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":"red bay rnlis hazel on call for the first time this christmas ","story":"Dog found with bleeding feet as Portadown man pleads guilty of animal welfare offences   Masked men armed with a hammer break into Larne homeNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleRed Bay RNLI’s Hazel on call for the first time this ChristmasA Glasgow native, who moved to Cushendall three and a half years ago and has since joined the leboat crew at Red Bay RNLI, is preparing to drop everything this Christmasher pager sounds and there is an emergency at sea.By Una CulkinMonday, th December , : pm  \"       \"  As the charity launches its Christmas appeal, Hazel Imrie who runs a hardware store in the town, is urging people across Antrim – home to stations at Red Bay, Portrush and Larne - to help her fellow crew and the thousands of other volunteer crews carrying pagers over the festivities, to continue their lesaving work.“I joined the crew at Red Bay in February  just before Covid hit,” Hazel explained, “so unfortunately with the pandemic and restrictions, my training was disjointed, and it wasn’t until this year that I could focus on completing my assessments.“I have always had an interest in the work of the RNLI and I knew when I moved here with my partner who is from Cushendall, that I wanted to get involved because I could see how integral the service is to a coastal community. I wanted to give something back to the community that I was living in.”Red Bay RNLI crew member Hazel ImrieWith no prior maritime, sailing or boating experience, Hazel fully immersed herself into the rigorous training involved in becoming a crew member.“I have valued the support of an experienced team and I have learned so much from others. Everyone has been so welcoming, and the training has been hands on, practical and a really enjoyable experience.”Now as Hazel prepares for her pager to sound, she says there is a mixture of emotions involved ahead of her first call out: “I am excited but there is also anticipation and concern because you are going into the unknown, but I am also reassured because I know when that call does come, everyone  who turns up is experienced and will support me.”Like Hazel, thousands of volunteer crew members around Ireland and the UK, sign up to save every one from drowning – it has been the charity’s mission since .This Christmas many will leave their loved ones behind to answer the call, each time hoping to reunite another family, and see those in trouble on the water safely ed. Over the past decade, RNLI leboats have launched over , times during the festive period. But these rescues would not be possible without donations from the RNLI’s generous supporters, helping to fund the essential kit, training and equipment needed by leboat crews all year round.Hazel said: “This is my first Christmas on call and I know even over the festive period, our lesavers are ready to drop everything and rush to the aid of someone in trouble on the water.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.
