(Picture: MPS Specials)It is almost impossible to detect, but there is a camera hidden inside this cash machine.An off-duty special constable with the politan Police discovered it at an ATM in Westminster, London.The force tweeted images of the corrupt machine as a warning to people to always cover their pin number when getting cash out.The tweet said: ‘Off duty @MPSNewham Special Constable has sniffed out a covert camera recording the pin pad of this ATM in @MPSWestminster.‘This is why it is so important to #CoverYourPin when taking out cash.’The special constable just happened to spot this tiny camera on an ATM in Westminster, London (Picture: MPS Specials)According to Action Fraud, there are a number of ways fraudsters can use a cash machine to steal your card or banking details.Using a camera is a more high-tech approach to discovering someone’s PIN. Fraudsters will then look to steal your card and make a large cash withdrawal before you are able to cancel the card,Hidden cameras may be placed in the top or sides of the machine.Other ways cash machines can be targeted include by attaching a skimmer that fits over the card slot and is made to look like a normal part of the cash machine.A card trap, is slid inside the real card slot so that when you finish using the machine, your card is swallowed and won’t come out of the ATM.Fraudsters will watch and wait until you leave the area, remove the trap from the slot and take your card.If you still can’t spot the camera…The camera is hidden in a fixture attached to the ATM (Picture: MPS Specials)The fraudsters have added a front on the card slot that works as a camera. It takes a while to spot.Action Fraud has guidelines on protecting yourself against cash machine fraud, which occurs when someone’s credit or debit card information is taken by fraudsters when they use an ATM machine.Check a cash machine every time you use one. Always cover the keypad when entering your PIN and don’t make it obvious which buttons you’re pressing.Spot the signsYou find a wobbly or bulky part that doesn’t seem to belong with the machine, such as a cover over the card slot or a loose keypad.How to report itMake sure you have your card issuer’s emergency number with you."},{"url":"http://metro.co.uk/author/miranda-larbi-for-metro-co-uk/\" class=\"author url fn\" rel=\"author\"\u003eMiranda Larbi\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cspan class=\"post-date\" itemprop=\"datePublished\"\u003eTuesday 8 May 2018 3:28 pm\u003c/span\u003e\u003cmeta itemprop=\"dateModified\" content=\"2018-05-08T17:41:53+0100","title":"dont call intersectional feminist slumflower dating race self love","story":"Unless you’ve been in a social media hole for the past year, you’ll no doubt be familiar with The Slumflower.An award-winning blogger, Chidera Eggerue is one of the most outspoken women on the internet right now – encouraging women, and especially black women, to realise their worth.At just 23, she’s just about to bring out her first self-help book, What A Time To Be Alone, which is full of Igbo proverbs from her family’s homeland of Nigeria.‘When the rat follows the lizard out into the rain, it’s only the rat who gets soaked’ is one of Chidera’s favourites.‘A lizard has scaly skin but a rat has fur so it’ll be soaked for quite a while the meaning of that is that you should be careful about the kinds of influences you allow into your life,’ she tells .‘Just because someone else has responded positively or hasn’t been harmed by doing something, that doesn’t mean that’ll necessarily be the case for you. You have to allow your intuition to guide you rather than rely on other people to tell you how to be yourself.’So with that in mind, and in the wake of the Gigi Hadid skin darkening debacle last week and Kanye continuing to be…Kayne, we sat down to talk about all things race, dating and self-love.As a black woman who has dark skin, I’ve always found it fascinating to see white people darken their skin because racism exists – racism is a dislike of dark-skinned people and racism festers in the system that we operate in. For white people to darken their skin to look like the people they suppress is a very interesting way to go about  life. I used to get quite annoyed by it but now I’m just so over it – in fact, it makes me more excited to be a black woman because I don’t have to spend money on UV beds or tanning products, I just have to put on some vaseline and I’m good.I often feel like if you’re a mixed person and you’re white passing, to an extent it does make sense to use that to your own benefit but again I’ve reached a point where I’ve just given up on feeling resentment towards people who allow themselves to live a better life because they’re on an advantage. To some degree, there’s always going to be people who act in a certain way and you just have to let it go. The people who hold the power have the responsibility to change the way that they allow the system to work I can either be frustrated about and let it ruin my day or just do my own thing.It’s an act of privilege in itself to be white and say that you’re black because regardless of whether you open your mouth or not, the world is still going to treat you as a white woman. But if I as a black woman with dark skin were to start saying, “oh, I’m white, I’ve always felt like I’m white”, no one is going to take me seriously – even if I do walk around believing that I’m white, the world will still respond to me as such because everything is ultimately about the darkness of our skins.I think Kayne’s a product of his environment and that doesn’t in any way justify the way in which he thinks – it’s really really sad for him to say something like slavery is a choice. Slavery isn’t just going up to someone and making them do something for you part of slavery involved raping women – rape isn’t a choice. Part of slavery involved women having babies ripped out of their arms and fed to alligators – I don’t think that was a choice.He has said that he doesn’t read so…the internet is giving so much attention to this man baby and it’d be nice if everyone could just let him fester in his own ignorance. He’s a danger to himself and it’s harrowing to see so many people agreeing with him or doing intellectual gymnastics to see where he’s coming from. You don’t always have to work to understand why people are saying harmful things – when he says that slavery is a choice, he’s essentially enabling white people to justify the belief that black people have a victim mentality which is completely untrue. I hope he gets the help he deserves.We saw that during the women’s march – with all the pink hats and armpit hair and vaginas. White feminism prioritises the topical issues, which are still very important, like body hair, reproductive rights, employment issues, wage gap but then I don’t see us talking enough about female genital mutilation, child brides, about the fact that misogyny has a very dangerous effect in Africa and the Middle East. It’s bad here in the west but it’s way worse in Africa where girls as young as nine are being made pregnant.If you want a movement to be effective, you have to prioritise the most marginalised. For me, white feminism just prioritises whiteness and creates racist results – if feminism was for all women, then I would be seeing white people at Black Lives Matter marches because black women exist and black women are dying at the hands of the state and black women are victims of gang violence and are victims of neighbourhoods that are underfunded. I don’t see any of that support and that’s part of the reason that I don’t identify as an intersectional feminist – I just identify as a feminist because as a black woman, my feminism is already intersectional.It prioritises issues that affect black people. If you want any kind of movement or new way of thinking to work, you’ve got to start with those who are most effective. I definitely do receive a lot of friction online whenever I say anything bold, tenacious or courageous because remember that black women are supposed to be seen and not heard. And that’s evident in the way that black women are represented, especially on social media.Most of the time when we do see black women in positions of glorification, they’re oiled up and super dark-skinned and wearing African print bikinis so there’s this heavy level of fetishisation. But the moment that black woman speaks up and says, “hey, I have a right to be heard and I’m not prepared to compromise for anyone”, she gets really attacked and pressured.I’m really big on black women specifically to stop sacrificing themselves for anybody because the world views us as this grandma whose always got this emotional toolbox ready to nurse you when you’ve got it wrong again. It’s such a harmful rhetoric we have to stop seeing black women as supernatural beings.What I Rent: Christie and Dom, £1,100 for a flat in LewishamMaternity photoshoot shows off pregnant mum\u0027s floral prosthetic leg It means that no one is looking out for or protecting them. So when a black woman does speak out and does so boldly, people often respond with knee-jerk reactions. You shouldn’t be that bold, that loud about it. I refuse to be silenced by the people who live better lives because they’re standing on my back. I don’t expect every black woman to do that because no one deserves to have to spend their lives dismantling a system that they didn’t build but I feel like I’m in a position where I can deliver that message and I’m not harmed by it because I can tap out – I’d love to be that person that black women can live vicariously through until they can speak out for themselves. I have that worry every single day and it’s annoying because you have the choice to either create the standards that you deserve or settle. A lot of women don’t realise that they’re settling because they don’t think beyond what they’ve been told they deserve. That means that they feel happy in oppressive relationships without even realising that they’re oppressive because not all oppressive behaviour is physically or verbally violent. It means that the more and more that I learn how insidious and visible misogyny can be, the more put off I become and the more disappointed I become that I’m straight. As a woman who is an intelligent feminist, it’d make sense for me to be attracted to women because it’d be a less oppressive relationship. Of course, women can have internalised misogynism and lesbian or bisexual relationships aren’t necessarily better than straight ones but it feels like as a straight woman, I am on the lookout for a man who is genuinely a feminist and not a fake one. There are a lot of men out there who say all the right language but their behaviour trips them up. I feel very bored with the concept of dating. I don’t even get excited about men who are feminists anymore because being a feminist should be the bare minimum. You should be fighting for a world that is safer for me because men need feminism too – we need to create a world where fragility and vulnerability is nurtured. Men need feminism but men also need to go and do the work on themselves a lot of the time it feels like men don’t know where to start and that’s not an excuse anymore. In 2018, if you know how to type in the name of your favourite social media page, you also know how to go to Google and type simple search terms like ‘how to stop being sad’, ‘local therapists near me’. If you can afford to be buying new trainers or subscribing to your favourite football channel, then you can also afford a therapist women are not therapists and relationships are not therapy. If men want to have more fruitful relationships and if we want the world to be a better place, men have to start prioritising their own healing so that both people can come into a relationship whole. Dating after orce: How to date as a single parentWoman 33 years younger than her partner shares how to make age-gap relationships workAbsolutely – I know men like that. He started out as someone who wasn’t necessarily the most respectful of women and he reached a point where he realised that the more he kept hurting women, the more he kept hurting himself. He had to go away and do the work…he saw it as his responsibility to be the most emotionally mature man he could be for himself. There are men out there who are doing the work on themselves but you have to want better for yourself and believe you deserve better.They were fat bloggers and where they were coming from was very valid they were expressing the fact that they feel the body positivity movement has been hijacked by slimmer women. Women who are a size 10-12 who might have a bit of a podgy belly are uploading pictures of them holding it in and pushing it out and sure, they’re making a statement…but it distracts from the fact that the larger your body is, the worse you’re treated by society.Fat women still deserve to have the loudest voice in the body positive movement because they created it.Regardless of your body size, your boobs can be saggy and I acknowledge the fact that I benefit from skinny privilege and I benefit from pretty privilege.I still do need to make sure that I put that message out there but I still have a responsibility to uplift and promote the plus size women who are within my reach. If I do see a fat woman who is talking about body positivity, I have to retweet her or talk about it on my Instagram stories – something to make sure that I’m lending my voice to her because I have the benefit of people listening to me rather than the fat women who actually started the movement. That’s how you utilise privilege, by using your voice to help others. What A Time To Be Alone is available on pre-order now from Amazon and is out 26 July 2018.MORE: ‘Netflix of fitness apps’: How Fiit could actually replace your gym membership"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_10973403.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"fans cant figure kylie jenner wearing band aid met ball just weird tan lines","story":"Too cute, we repeat, too cute. But can You spot the plaster? (Picture: Invision)Kylie Jenner rocked up to the Met Ball on Monday night along with baby daddy Travis Scott.It was their first outing as parents since they welcomed baby Stormi Webster in February.And even though her outfit had literally nothing to do with the evening’s theme, Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, she was obviously working the red carpet.However, for some hilarious reason that would only happen in the world of the Kardashians, all this was shunned aside when fans noticed something interesting on Kylie’s arm.This look was everything, we have to say (Picture: Getty)She sported a black Alexander Wang gown – as well as thigh-high boots sporting the name of the designer up the leg – as well as teeny-tiny sunglasses.Was it a bandaid?Was it a tan line?No, it’s…we have NFI.Fans took to social media bascailly the second she waltzed down the red carpet and was snapped with Selena Gomez to start speculating on the cause of the interesting mark on her right arm.Some thought it was a Band-Aid that was beautifully blended in to match the exact colour of the beauty entrepreneur’s tanned skin.While other though that perhaps it was leftover ‘gunk’ of a previous plaster, which just sounds a little rank.And some thought perhaps it was the tan sticking to something – potentially said gunk – to create an outline.Who knows, maybe she just signed a deal with Band-Aid  ¯\\_(ツ)_¯We’re yet to get to the bottom of whether this indeed a plaster and what on earth Kylie was sporting it for – perhaps an immunisation?

(Picture: Alexander Crawley)Fancy having a look inside a bunch of people’s homes?But there’s a reason we’re taking you inside people’s rented houses in London, beyond wanting to see people’s cupboard organisation.The current renting situation is a nightmare. It’s tricky to know what’s a reasonable amount to pay each month, the majority of viewings you go on are dismal rooms with shoddy showers, and it’s hard to get a proper sense of what other people are getting for what they pay.So for What I Rent, we’re showing you around a different person’s rented property each week, to gradually bring us closer to a clearer picture of renting.This week we’re talking to Christie and Dom, who live in Lewisham.The couple pays £1,100 each month. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)First off: How much are you paying and what are you getting in return?We pay £1,100 between us and the flat came fully furnished – apart from the matching red kitchen stuff – we have my lovely nan to thank for those!When we were looking for places to move in we set our upper limit to £1,200 so when we found this for cheaper we were super happy.Dom used to live in a rank flatshare in Vauxhall where you came out of the shower feeling dirtier than when you went in, and he used to pay £600 for the room only. So moving here actually meant him saving money on his rent.Our place is one bedroom, one bathroom, and a big livingdiningkitchen area. We also have a little room for the washing machine and storage too.There’s a bedroom, a bathroom, and a living room and kitchen area. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)One of the only things we decided on when we were looking to move out was that we want one bedroom and definitely wouldn’t go for a studio.The thought of eating, sleeping, chilling, and doing whatever else in the same room makes me feel weird.And what about bills?I feel like we’ve never fully sat down and worked it out. I’d say probably around £100 a month?Luckily our flat is really warm so we rarely have to put the heating on.Whereabouts is the flat?Our flat is in Lewisham, down the insanely busy high street. Luckily our window looks out the back so it’s relatively quiet.It’s really handy being on the high street though because we’ve got loads of hangover-friendly food options in walking distance as well as the shopping centre and the station just a five minute walk away.Plus we live on top of a gym which I’ve just managed to rope Dom into joining under the guise of ‘when are we ever going to live on top of a 24-hour gym again?’It’s a really great location all round to be honest.The flat’s in Lewisham, which is pretty well connected. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)When we tell people we live in Lewisham everyone thinks it’s really far out but it’s actually in Zone 2.It takes 10 minutes to get to London Bridge by train and 20 minutes to Cannon Street, which was one of the first things we made sure of before we viewed the flat. Plus DLR links to Canary Wharf, Bank and Stratford.How did you find your flat?We found it on RightMove. We dedicated one Sunday afternoon at my parents to just hunting for potential flats with the view of arranging viewings for the following week. We viewed this one on the Tuesday and it was held off the market for us that evening.It was the first one we viewed but we knew we really liked it. We also knew that it was cheap for what it was and that there had been viewings before us too, so over a romantic dinner in what would be our new local spoons we decided to go for it.How long have you been there?We’ve lived here for just under a year, but have agreed that we’re going to sign the contract for another year.We have no real reason to move out. It’s a great location, it’s modern with huge windows, has great transport links.Plus we’d miss Tony the concierge if we left, he’s so friendly and always brings our parcels up to our front door for us.Christie admits the room could be a touch bigger, though. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)So you’re happy where you are, right?We’re really happy here – as I said before we have no real reason to move out.The building itself is a converted department store so has a lot of history and character behind it, despite the inside of the flat looking like every other modern flat in London.A lot of people think Lewisham is a e or a bit rough but I loved it as soon as we moved here.Lewisham itself is going under huge regeneration with new restaurants and bars popping up. Despite the regeneration there’s still a hugely multicultural feel – especially down Lewisham high street where there’s still the old school market.I reckon you can buy literally anything there – and it brings such a busy atmosphere especially on Saturday mornings.Plus there’s the Street Feast Model Market just at the other end of the high street which has some amazing food vendors and music.There are some really cool pubs too like the Fox and Firkin and Ladywell Tavern which both have really cool beer gardens and are both within walking distance.Plus if ever you get bored or want to explore somewhere near there’s New Cross, Deptford, Blackheath, Greenwich, and Peckham just down the road which are full of cool pubs, bars, and restaurants. Not to mention the amazing green spaces of Blackheath and Greenwich just 10 minutes from the hustle and bustle of Lewisham high street. It really is the best of both worlds.But having a bathtub is a nice bonus – plus a 24-hour gym in the building. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Do you feel like you have enough space?While the flat is small I think it’s definitely enough space for us.In terms of storage space it’s a little tight but I think that’s just because we have a lot of stuff.We’ve had to resort to slinging things on top of the wardrobe or down the side of the drawers in the bedroom. You don’t even want to look under the bed… there are boxes and suitcases of shoes and clothes under there too.You two are a couple, so you don’t have to put up with any housemate awkwardness. Was moving in together a big decision?We met at uni and so spent a lot of time together there. After uni we were both in London although I was living at my parents (Uxbridge, Zone 6) and working near Heathrow airport so we only saw each other at weekends.My job was only maternity cover though and I wanted to be working in London so we kind of both agreed that when I got a new job we would look for somewhere to live.It was never really up for discussion we both just kind of knew it was the next step in our relationship.We’d already been together almost three years by the time we moved in so wasn’t particularly a risky move.And as a couple, they don’t have to worry about any housemate weirdness. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)This all sounds dreamy. Is there anything not so great about where you’re living?I wouldn’t say major issues but there’s some building work going on at the moment as they’re adding two extra floors to the building. So recently we’ve been greeted with loud drilling some mornings.Apart from that we’ve never had any issues with the flat itself, our landlord, or our agent which I feel is a rarity when you rent in London.The bedroom is verging on a little too small for us, and has a weird internal window that makes the room too dingy when you want it to be light and too light when you want it to be dark.Have you considered buying a place?We’ve definitely spoke about it but I think more in the sense of a distant possibility rather than something that’s going to happen soon. With such huge deposits required and such a high cost of living in London it’s just not achievable for us to start saving for a house deposit at the moment.We’re both still relatively young (23 and 24) so we’re happy renting for now.Plus, I think there’s definitely less importance around being a homeowner these days, especially in London.When we do eventually buy a house I think it would definitely be outside of London. Not only for the price but I’m really missing having a garden to sunbathe in!Now, let’s have a proper look around Christie and Dom’s flat…(Picture: Alexander Crawley)MORE: What I Rent: Miranda and George, £1,283 for a flat in HighgateMORE: What I Rent: Mel, £615 a month for a room in Newington Green"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/07/22/4BF3E02400000578-5701277--m-101_1525729857016.jpg","title":"Fans hide delight Peter Kays Car Share returns screens","story":"Peter Kay rejoined his co-star Sian Gibson, 41, for a new episode showing the pair ad-libbing their way through an entire car journey          Fans are rejoicing Kay’s return after millions tuned in to watch the show’s debut on BBC IPlayer and with the second series attracting 10 million viewers on BBC1Yet the comedian sparked hopes of a comeback after making a surprise appearance at a recent Car Share charity screening.Fans are rejoicing Kay’s return after millions tuned in to watch the show’s debut on BBC IPlayer and with the second series attracting 10 million viewers on BBC1. One viewer tweeted: \u0027Have missed Peter Kay #CarShareUnscripted just about genius!\u0027Police break into a car to free three dogs that were left...Britons brave hour-long motorway queues as they head home...Share this articleOthers said: \u0027Great to have Car Share back on TV\u0027 and \u0027Love Car Share, miss you Peter Kay - so funny.\u0027\u0027Great to see Peter Kay back on the telly.

She has been cut open from throat to pelvis, the baby exposed in her belly.Despite knowledge of a large number of babies born at Unit 731, there are no accounts of any survivors - including children.           Unit of torture: The senior officers of Unit 731 are pictured during World War II          Chinese adults and children have been infected with an unknown illness and are being monitored by Japanese medical staff at Unit 731 Some of those at Unit 731 died in experiments testing weapons such as grenades and biological bombs. Others are said to have been buried alive or drowned. As well as the 3,000  killed  at Unit 731, tens of thousands are also thought to have died when the Japanese used what they had learned against their enemies in the war - mainly Chinese civilians.In addition to releasing plague-infected fleas, the Japanese are known to have planted typhoid fever, cholera and other diseases into the water systems in Chinese villages.

They are so close that she has been dubbed \u0027Meghan\u0027s girl Friday\u0027 - Meghan describes herself as \u0027Aunty Meg\u0027 to her three children.Jessica first came to public attention in November 2015 when she styled Sophie for Justin Trudeau\u0027s inauguration: she wore a cream wrap coat by Canadian designer Sentaler, a favourite of Meghan.\u0027She needed a few things to wear and was so busy,\u0027 Mulroney said afterwards. \u0027I was in Toronto, so I sent her some options. She wore a coat by Canadian designer Sentaler and people went crazy for it. We had created this media frenzy, like you see with anything Kate wears.\u0027But it was only after Meghan began dating Prince Harry in 2016 that Mulroney became a global name. It was in her house that the couple sought refuge when news of their relationship broke.Then, last September, as speculation of an engagement reached fever pitch, Mulroney was in a box with Meghan, her mother Doria, and Markus Anderson, for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games.Harry joined them for the final 20 minutes of the show, standing arm in arm with Meghan and planting a kiss on her check as they watched Bryan Adams sing love songs.And, when Harry and Meghan got engaged last November, Mulroney was credited with orchestrating the outfit – a white wrap coat by The Line, PAROSH green dress and Aquazzura nude pumps.She is also believed to be the brains behind Meghan\u0027s outfits for many of her official engagements and is instrumental in helping her choose her wedding dress.    The relaxed snaps are a far cry from Meghan\u0027s polished appearances with Harry, such as the Anzac Day Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey last month  The candid photos show just how close the women are as Jessica and Meghan spend time away from the spotlight on holiday  A source close to Maghan has revealed how the friendship has blossomed since their time together in Toronto.  \u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle saidThe couple had a dress rehearsal on Suits when Jessica helped her choose the Anne Barge Versailles dress from Jessica\u0027s Kleinfeld Canada bridal boutique when her Suits character Rachel Zane was supposed to marry Mike Ross - only for him to leave her at the altar.She flew to London in January to attend the first fitting and was in London in April when Meghan had her final fitting. Mulroney jetted into Heathrow for a \u0027mini hen party\u0027 and was given a sneak preview of the dress and the wedding venue.She has been so successful in helping Meghan create her \u0027effortless chic\u0027 style that Vogue, editor Edward Enninful believes she could eclipse the Duchess of Cambridge. \u0027Ms Markle is an astonishing fashion sales force, who is setting the industry alight,\u0027 he said recently.A royal source said: \u0027Jessica is Meghan\u0027s BFF (best friend forever) and has been a huge influence. Meghan\u0027s turned to her for advice on everything from the dress, the flowers, decorations in church, the wedding lunch — and even the seating plan. \u0027Although Jess lives in Toronto, the two are on the phone all the time. Meg wanted Jess at the final fitting as it\u0027ll be the most famous dress of the year and she\u0027s quite nervous about it. It all went really well and they were delighted with the result.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/12/4BF87BE700000578-5703381-image-m-12_1525779072907.jpg","title":"Cannes Film Festival no longer let critics movies red carpet","story":"    Cannes has cancelled all advance press screenings so actors and filmmakers\u0027 of bad films don\u0027t have their spirits crushed before the premiereStars would walk down the red carpet blissfully unaware that their film had been given scathing one-star reviews.That model was \u0027blown to bits\u0027 by the internet where reviews on news websites, film blogs, and social media were posted within hours, or even minutes, of the screening.Organisers insisted the first major change to the festival programme in decades was \u0027necessary\u0027 to protect the egos of stars.\u0027The underlying logic was was based on best practice blown to bits by the massive incursion of digital technologies in our professional and personal lives over the past 15 years or so,\u0027 it wrote in a letter to the press seen by The Telegraph.\u0027Basically, as soon as the film is screened, the social networks turn it into confetti-like strips of rumours.\u0027  In 2016 critics savaged The Last Face starring Charlize Theron (left) as the lowest point of actor-director Sean Penn\u0027s (right, with Theron) career          Earlier in 2012, Nicole Kidman had to walk the red carpet after a scene in The Paperboy where her character (pictured) urinates on the one played by Zac Effron made newsThe letter said the new principle was to make the gala session attended by the people who made the film the \u0027veritable first screening\u0027.\u0027When the team walks the red carpet and enters the room... the moment will be far more powerful as no one will have already seen the film,\u0027 it read.Academy of Motion Pictures expels convicted indecent...Kate Winslet urges women to cover up on the red carpet as...Share this articleNumerous Hollywood stars have been glum-faced or asked uncomfortable questions as they walked the red carpet after bad reviews at recent Cannes events.In 2016 critics savaged The Last Face starring Charlize Theron as the lowest point of actor-director Sean Penn\u0027s career.

If customers don\u0027t have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed.\u0027While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app -these funds are not taken from their account.

She says she drinks more now she\u0027s olderI usually celebrate the end of the working week with a drink with colleagues. Later, I’ll toast the weekend with a few large glasses of Merlot, sitting on the sofa at home. With three daughters, grandchildren, a full-time job and a college course, I have lots of demands on me. Wine helps me to relax.I’m an outgoing, sociable person. Graham, my partner, who’s 40, and I will often go out with friends on a Saturday night. If I’m off to a party, I’ll have a couple of cocktails at home to get me in the mood, then switch to red wine once we’re out. I can drink a bottle over the course of an evening and have a few cocktails, too, without any ill-effects.Most of the people I know drink like me, and it certainly doesn’t feel excessive or something to worry about.My alcohol consumption has definitely increased with age. I married and had children young, so had a lot of responsibilities in my 20s. Back then, wine was a rare treat.Sadly, I was widowed young, too. My husband took his own life after suffering from depression. It was a very difficult time for all of us — but even then I rarely drank.But now that the children are grown up with families of their own, and I’m in a happy new relationship, I feel I deserve to enjoy my freedom.I don’t think that it’s impacted on my health or life in a negative way. I don’t suffer hangovers but, admittedly, I don’t sleep brilliantly. Often it takes me an hour or two to fall asleep and I often wake in the night, but I think that is more to do with my age (I’m peri-menopausal).Sunday lunch wouldn’t be the same without wine, and Graham and I usually share a bottle of white with our roast chicken. I wouldn’t say I crave it, but it has become a habit.Sometimes I’ll have a Cointreau, too. It’s a nice way to finish a meal.          Mandie likes a bottle of wine over a Sunday lunch of roast chicken and drinks most nightsDuring the week I drink most nights. I like a glass of wine while I’m cooking and I’ll have another glass or two over dinner. If I’ve got friends over, then the alcohol always flows. We’d have much less fun without it.My daughters barely drink, but they don’t nag me about my habits. The only time they do bring it up is when I complain about my weight — then they’re quick to point out that alcohol is packed with calories. I’m interested to see how I get on without drinking any alcohol for a week.         Accountant who was five times over the limit when she was...‘I wanted to be a nurse — then realised girls can be...Share this articleThe daughter’s storyKala Spokes, 29, is a business development manager and mum to Jack, seven, and Summer, four. She drinks very rarely.Her typical weekly alcohol intake is 0 units.    Kala very rarely drinks. She prefers a cup of tea to a bottle of wine if a friend pops over When it gets to Friday night, I know my mum, like many of her generation, likes to wind down with a bottle of wine — but that just doesn’t appeal to me. Not only have I got the responsibility of my two young children — I’ve been a single mother since their father and I separated three years ago — but I don’t even like the taste of most alcoholic drinks.In my teens I’d go drinking with friends, but I’m confident and talkative and I soon realised I could have just as good a time without alcohol.Nowadays I have a couple of drinks when I go to parties — something sweet and palatable like a Southern Comfort and Coke — but never on a work night and certainly not at home.I’m not unusual among women my age. We’re focused on health and fitness and on staying slim.That’s more important than going out and getting drunk.If a girlfriend calls round in the evening, we won’t open a bottle of wine but will have a cup of tea instead. Our only decadence is sharing a bar of chocolate.As I tell Mum when she complains about feeling fat, drink’s full of calories. It boosts your appetite, too, and in my experience those who drink tend to eat more junk.Mum doesn’t sleep well and I think that’s down to the drink. I’ve seen research showing that alcohol means you spend less time in deep sleep and more in the lighter, less satisfying stages.And that is certainly confirmed by my sleep habits: I get eight or nine hours of unbroken sleep most nights and wake up refreshed.That said, I’m no party pooper. I love socialising and chatting with friends — few of whom drink. I think our attitude might have something to do with all the alcohol awareness campaigns we were exposed to while growing up.  Kala says her generation are more concerned with staying slim than going out boozingWe don’t see it as merely a social lubricant but as something that can cause cancer, heart disease and all kinds of other health problems.I’m a bit nervous about adopting my mother’s drinking habits as, although I don’t think she has a drink problem, I worry that she drinks far too much.I’ve picked a week when the children will be with their dad most of the time to swap drinking habits with her.After a rundown from Mum on what wine and spirits I’m going to need, I stocked up and almost fell over at the Sainsbury’s checkout when I saw the bill: £89! That’s already put me in a bad mood.

The usual suspects were there – those who spoke on the duke\u0027s little rebellion included that interminable Euro-groupie and former diplomat Lord Hannay, and his fellow crossbencher Lord Butler, once cabinet secretary. There may have been many more who voted when the House ided, but the actual debate was under-attended.Most peers know where they stand on Brexit, and it is not on the side of the majority who voted in the 2016 referendum. They were elsewhere on the parliamentary estate yesterday. I bet the bars were doing brisk business.           He helped bring about another defeat for Theresa May (pictured) and her ministers. And usAnd so we come to the Duke of Wellington, nominally a follower of the Tory Whip but, on this issue, happy to ignore his political affiliation in favour of his apparently stronger loyalty to the European Elite Party.I merely note that his duchess, Antonia, is a Princess of Prussia. He himself, Charles Valerian Wellesley OBE, DL, with more titles than a champion boxer, after schooling at Eton, has had a business career, home and abroad.He is a member of Portugal\u0027s Order of Merit and he holds the Grand Cross of the Spanish Order of Isobel the Catholic. Ole!          The first Duke of Wellington (pictured) was a tremendous thumper of the French, the victor of Waterloo, later prime minister Where once his illustrious forebear wore battle colours and carried a riding crop, this silk-suited patrician, purring in a voice that was pure gin and French, put it to their lordships that he was merely \u0027trying to help the Government and not in any way to thwart\u0027 Brexit. Noo noo, of course not. Dear heart, the thought never crossed our minds.He argued simply that it was a frightful bind for ministers to have to work with the burden of this set date for our departure. How much more they could achieve if that date were not there!Lord Butler, from what I could understand, sought to suggest that dropping the date might actually allow Brexit to be delayed for ever, but the duke did not want to pursue that idea.Eurosceptic opposition came from Lord Grocott, a Labour peer who has had to put up with some pretty bad heckling in recent months (his party colleagues at the far end of the Palace of Westminster hate him for siding with the voters).He recalled Parkinson\u0027s Law, which states that \u0027work expands to fill the time available\u0027 and he suspected that the Europhiles were merely attempting to hold up Brexit. His voice went unheeded and the duke\u0027s dismal little delay was approved by a House that, with every day, looks riper for the abattoir.Does this sort of thing help the Remainers? To have an hereditary peer, one of the most blue of all blue-bloods, helping their cause? I suspect not. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/07/23/4BF3F34300000578-0-image-a-9_1525731672349.jpg","title":"RICHARD LITTLEJOHN time Nonce Finder General dock","story":"    When he\u0027s not trying to shackle our free Press, or cosying up to the odious Max Mosley — from whom he has accepted £540,000 in donations — Tom Watson can be found pursuing a deranged vendetta against senior Tories he accuses of sex crimes. In a harrowing interview in Saturday\u0027s Mail, Sue Reid spoke to a young couple caught up in the madness who were threatened with the prospect of their baby daughter being taken away from them.Their only \u0027crime\u0027 was to live in a two-bedroom flat in the same building as ex-Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, who was wrongly accused of three counts of murder, child sex abuse and male rape.In February 2015, police and social services turned up at the property, on the Duke of Rutland\u0027s estate in Leicestershire, and ordered Adam and Charlotte Coxon to move out immediately.MasterChef contestant Aldo Ortado is revealed as a...Madonna, Cindy Crawford and Katharine McPhee get ready for...DJ Simon Mayo who earns £400,000 a year believes BBC...Met Gala 2018: Heavenly bodies!

She has been cut open from throat to pelvis, the baby exposed in her belly.Despite knowledge of a large number of babies born at Unit 731, there are no accounts of any survivors - including children.           Unit of torture: The senior officers of Unit 731 are pictured during World War II          Chinese adults and children have been infected with an unknown illness and are being monitored by Japanese medical staff at Unit 731 Some of those at Unit 731 died in experiments testing weapons such as grenades and biological bombs.

If customers don\u0027t have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed.\u0027While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app -these funds are not taken from their account.

Noo noo, of course not. Dear heart, the thought never crossed our minds.He argued simply that it was a frightful bind for ministers to have to work with the burden of this set date for our departure. How much more they could achieve if that date were not there!Lord Butler, from what I could understand, sought to suggest that dropping the date might actually allow Brexit to be delayed for ever, but the duke did not want to pursue that idea.Eurosceptic opposition came from Lord Grocott, a Labour peer who has had to put up with some pretty bad heckling in recent months (his party colleagues at the far end of the Palace of Westminster hate him for siding with the voters).He recalled Parkinson\u0027s Law, which states that \u0027work expands to fill the time available\u0027 and he suspected that the Europhiles were merely attempting to hold up Brexit. His voice went unheeded and the duke\u0027s dismal little delay was approved by a House that, with every day, looks riper for the abattoir.Does this sort of thing help the Remainers?

But will anyone else move in?Billboards promising another way of life have long clustered alongside the clogged highways of central Cairo. Advertisements for gated housing developments called “Regent’s Park”, “Beta Greens” or “Uptown” promise “360-degree greenery” and open spaces. One, on a busy and polluted central road, invites onlookers to “just breathe”.The promise of escape from the congestion of central Cairo to a new life 40km away on the city’s outskirts is fetishised for those able to afford it. Nowhere is this more clear than on the billboards advertising real estate in “Entrada”, a housing and commercial property development in Egypt’s new administrative capital, which is currently without a name. “Welcome to a supreme community,” proclaims one. The development is touted by its creators as “the entrance to a new city, a new lifestyle, a new community and a new worldwide centre of attraction”.The alternative capital will  700 sq km, making it almost as large as Singapore, and is intended to house a total of five million people. The plan shows an expanse of high-rises and residential buildings as well as a “government district” all stationed around a central “green river”, a combination of open water and planted greenery twice the size of New York’s Central Park.The project is designed to wipe clean the problems of Cairo, and build a glistening new future. Most government buildings, as well as those occupied by the Egyptian president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, are scheduled to move there in June 2019. Foreign embassies are also encouraged to relocate, and businesses will be lured to a central business district of 20 Chinese-built skyscrapers. But what will happen to the old city once the new capital takes root?If the government’s plans are successful, the move will leave behind a network of empty buildings, all owned by the same umbrella company as the new capital, and for which there is currently no plan. For the government, the new administrative capital represents a fresh start – but one that will draw wealth from the existing capital.During a visit to the site last October, journalists were invited to view the construction of Egypt’s largest church, a new cabinet building, and stood looking at a stagnant future ornamental pool as a pair of fighter jets conducted a ceremonial flyover. Pictures of Entrada show spacious villas next to snaking pools of water and advertise their proximity to the development’s 4km of theme parks and so-called natural terrain. A two-bedroom apartment – with “a view of water”, private gardens and a maids’ room – is listed for around £45,000. The spokesman for the project, Khaled El-Husseiny, resisted questions about the quantity of affordable housing available in the new capital and the average price of real estate. “Forget the numbers, they’re not important and not fixed,” he said, frustrated. “We have a dream, and we’re building our dreams now.”“For example, the ministry of housing owns a building or many buildings in downtown Cairo,” he says. “I will give a new ministry building here, a smart and connected one, air-conditioned and up to date, and we at ACUD will take the old one. We are establishing a new company just to control all the buildings that we will receive from all the ministries.” The future of the many buildings that make up Egypt’s sprawling state infrastructure, mostly situated on prime real estate in central Cairo, remains uncertain. “We have no plan as to how to invest in these buildings, but we will fix it and figure it out,” says El-Husseiny. “Maybe we can make them into hotels.” Profits from these vacated buildings will then feed back into the ACUD. But it is also unclear just how much money is being sunk into the new administrative capital. It was given an initial estimated cost of £30bn in 2015.“There is no total budget,” says El-Husseiny. “It’s a big one, a great one, but we must also calculate the cost of building infrastructure.” He adds that the ACUD was founded with a cash injection of 204bn EGP (£8.5bn) from the ministry of defence and the ministry of housing, but emphasises that the project will continue without further government assistance.There are two kinds of budget, he says: “The budget according to the documents and the actual budget they have to pay.” He says the ACUD has already repaid 20bn EGP to the banks, although the source of these funds is unclear, as is who will ultimately pay for the rest of the sparkling buildings shown in the plans.El-Husseiny stresses the budget for the new capital will be settled on a “case by case basis” as each part is constructed. The governmental district, for example, will cost 40bn EGP. – By way of comparison, Egypt accepted a $12bn (£8.8bn) emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund in 2016.The new capital will also draw on Cairo’s much-needed resources. Two water stations will pump an estimated 200,000 cubic metres of water per day, siphoning water from nearby satellite cities. Once the project is completed it will use an estimated 1.5m cubic metres of water per day. “In Brazil it was Rio and it became Brasília – we need this. It costs billions, we know, but we need it,” says El-Husseiny, referencing Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa’s landmark project to build a new capital in Brazil, now regarded as a symbol of the failure of urban planning and inequality. It is hoped Egypt’s new capital will house almost twice the population of Brasília, while paradoxically appealing to incomers as a way to escape Cairo’s crowded street life. There is no doubt that Cairo’s rapidly expanding population desperately needs housing. The number of inhabitants grew by half a million in 2017, making it the world’s fastest-growing city. Greater Cairo, now a megalopolis, housed 22.9 million people as of mid-2016 and is projected to contain 40 million by 2050. But the city is already ringed by a large collection of half-empty planned towns, each a failed monument to their developers’ inability to draw the bulk of the population away from downtown Cairo. Workers unable to afford to move to the new capital may be able to use the proposed electric train and monorail to get to work, but there are no guarantees that these will be competitively priced either. “In order for the new capital to succeed, if the goal is to reduce congestion, it doesn’t come simply by moving a few thousand employees,” says Elshahed. “Most government employees don’t own private cars, so it’s not like it’s them congesting downtown Cairo.”El-Husseiny, however, is determined that his vision alone will entice enough new residents, including foreign embassies and those working there. “We will give them benefits not available in the old Cairo, wide streets and a smart city,” he says, going on to outline something quite dystopian: “A smart city means a safe city, with cameras and sensors everywhere. There will be a command centre to control the entire city.” A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Cairo says that while the Egyptian government has located space for embassies, they are currently “assessing the move”. Other embassies contacted by  Cities were hesitant, but unwilling to discuss this publicly. “Cairo isn’t suitable for the Egyptian people,” says El-Husseiny. “There are traffic jams on every street, the infrastructure can’t support the population, and it’s very crowded. Without any specific masterplan, it has started to become ugly … there’s no humanity.”There is no doubt that Cairo’s congestion makes residents fantasise about escape, although wide streets, double-glazed windows, open water and pruned topiary seem more like the dreams of suburban London or Chicago than ideas well-adapted to the desert plain. But El-Husseiny is adamant. “We need a landmark, a new capital. We have the right to have a dream and this is our dream.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c4fb816b5771f1e144285c02dde677d45333842/43_69_3226_1936/master/3226.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61480e37c1eb5541becc296bd19b0e1d","title":"from backstreet eats to five star feasts abu dhabis diverse dining scene","story":"Whether you’re on a blow-out budget or hunting for a bargain, Abu Dhabi has it all. Here, we pick some of the best – from souks to starry hauntsAbu Dhabi is a city of extremes, and we’re not just talking about that summer heat. The expensive tastes of wealthy locals and expats have seen it become a magnet for the biggest global names in hospitality, but if that’s not your scene, there’s also quite a selection of less overdraft-bothering local cafes that can offer astonishing value for money. From the ultra-shiny to the super-simple, here’s our pick of the best ...Liwan MansourLebanese is by far the UAE’s favourite cuisine, and despite the efforts of the capital’s top hotels, the best hummus and tabbouleh is still to be found in less polished surrounds. Most of the dishes here are simply on a par with nearby contenders, but it’s the takeaway shawarma – stuffed with beef or chicken, fries and garlic sauce – that make it a must for street-food seekers. Yours for just AED 6 (£1.16), one makes for a tasty lunch, two the perfect late night sustenance.liwanmansour.aeTandoori CornerIndian restaurants in Abu Dhabi fall into two categories: slick and pricey hotel-based operations, and backstreet curry houses where the bill can come in at a tenth of the price or less. Tandoori Corner (which isn’t, in fact, on a corner) is very much the latter, though the food is easily as good as its five-star competition. As with many Indian restaurants in the city, there’s a whole menu of Chinese dishes, too, making it perfect for any group at loggerheads over what they fancy for dinner.MeylasEmirati food is oddly difficult to come by in the United Arab Emirates. Looking to redress the balance is Shaikha Al Kaabi, a young local who first set up a roving foodtruck serving modern takes on the dishes of her childhood, and has since opened a bricks-and-mortar site. Start with the fareed (a meat and veg stew), before graduating to harees (a wheat pudding with beef). Even if one plate isn’t to your taste, dishes start at AED 20 (£4), so risks are minimal.meylasenBonna AnneeAs is tradition in Ethiopian cuisine, dishes at this welcoming backstreet restaurant come served up on a spongy sourdough flatbread called injera. This edible plate also serves as cutlery – rip a patch off and use it to scoop up the slow-cooked stews and curries on top. The Bonna Annee Special – preposterous value at just AED 40 (£8) – comprises a mix of meat and veg dishes, and will feed two people very handsomely indeed.Bord EauAbu Dhabi’s restaurant scene is full of wacky concepts. Thankfully, between the classic French cooking and the modestly stylish dining room, there are none to be found at this polished waterfront restaurant. That’s not to call Bord Eau stuffy – even traditional dishes such as boeuf bourguignon and confit duck surprise with canny twists and inventive presentation. Best of all, though, is the fact that even the simple stuff is beyond decadent – try the outrageously silken, buttery mash potato for evidence.shangri-laabudhabishangrilaHakkasanIt’s not unusual for glitzy restaurant brands to put down roots in the UAE. But Hakkasan – one of the first to do so – is unique in that it’s still every bit as good as it was when it first arrived at Emirates Palace eight years ago.

The menu plays it straight – a simple selection of beefy cuts, some gobsmackingly expensive, with steakhouse staples on the side.

If so, Abu Dhabi’s your placeThe United Arab Emirates has a reputation for the outlandish and the eccentric, and you’ll only need a few hours in its glitzy capital to see why. It’s hardly surprising, really: you can’t smush together centuries of Arabian tradition with oodles of international wealth – then use it to build one of the most ethnically erse, technologically ambitious cities on the planet – and expect the result to be run-of-the-mill. Looking for a break from the usual humdrum tourist itineraries? From high-speed camels to driverless cars, your hitlist starts here.Ride the world’s fastest roller coasterA veritable temple to the prancing horse, Ferrari World on Yas Island was the biggest indoor theme park on Earth when it opened in 2010. Its star attraction is Formula Rossa – a Formula One-themed ‘coaster that launches riders to a speed of 149mph in just four seconds, in the process inflicting the sort of G force that even Lewis Hamilton would describe as “a bit much”. Among other things, the park is also home to a fine-dining restaurant, which you’d do well to visit after your ride.Make tracks out to the desert for a camel raceAscot may have the upper hand when it comes to headwear, but for sheer dust-flinging excitement, a regular day at the races has nothing on the hump-backed alternative. This being Abu Dhabi, the regular meetings at Al Wathba – a short drive out of the city into the desert – are more high-tech, too, with robot jockeys taking the place of actual humans, who are relegated to riding alongside in SUVs and cheering like lunatics. Probably not how the Bedouin racers of yesteryear did it, but it’s a hell of a spectacle nonetheless.Hop aboard a driverless car in Masdar CitySomething a bit special is springing up out of the sand next to Abu Dhabi airport. Billing itself as a “greenprint” for how the sustainable cities of tomorrow will be built, Masdar City was envisaged as a 6 sq km (2.32 sq mile) district run entirely on renewable energy. This being the desert, most of the juice comes from solar power, which is used to run everything from street lights to the kitchens within the area’s growing stable of cafes and restaurants. Oh, and Masdar’s star attraction: the fleet of futuristic little driverless pods that zip visitors around the place like something out of a 90s sci-fi film.Admire the rainbow sheikh’s car collectionIt’s fair to say Sheikh Hamad bin Hamdan Al Nahyan is the petrolhead of the Emirati royal family. Set within a gleaming white pyramid just outside the city, the Emirates National Auto Museum houses the sheikh’s personal collection of cars, a fleet so vast and engine-revvingly macho it makes Jeremy Clarkson look like Jeremy Corbyn. Among the highlights are the world’s biggest pick-up truck (which has four bedrooms), a giant, driveable globe and a set of seven vintage Mercedes S-classes, one in each colour of the rainbow. Subtle? No. Spectacular? Oh yes.Clock a hot lap on an F1 trackWe’re sure the gym at your hotel is absolutely fine, but there’s a far more fun way to stay fit during your visit to Abu Dhabi. The Yas Marina Formula One race track welcomes walkers, runners, cyclists and rollerbladers on to its 5.5km (3.4 mile) grand prix circuit every Sunday and Tuesday evening (during the cooler months), and there’s even kit available to rent if you don’t fancy bringing your own. But no, sadly, they won’t let you spray rosewater from the podium if you set a new personal best.Strap on a water-powered jetpackIf you’ve ever fancied yourself as Iron-Man, flying around under your own steam, your luck is in. Thanks to the flyboard, a neat piece of kit that fires two high-pressure jets of water downwards, the wearer is able to float above the surface of the water. It’s simple enough even for watersport newbies to get to grips with in an hour-long lesson, and plenty of fun too.Experience the real Abu Dhabi.

Wander around its saline and freshwater lakes, sand dunes, scrubs and hillocks, and you’re almost guaranteed to see a flamingo – there were 4,000 of them at the last count. Egyptian spiny-tailed lizards, red foxes, greater spotted eagles and beautiful varieties of dragonflies and damselflies are among the reserve’s other draws. It’s open year-round and is free to enter (Thursdays to Saturdays, 8am to 4pm).ead.aeTake a desert safariFormed millions of years ago by a natural salt dome, Sir Bani Yas Island takes its name from the Bani Yas tribe, who chose to settle there. Today, this bioerse nature reserve is best explored on a 4x4 safari with a local wildlife expert. Two-hour family-friendly safari drives (best taken early in the morning when the animals hunt for breakfast) cost approximately £100 per person and offer the chance to spot some of the island’s 10,000 free-roaming animals, including giraffe, Sudan cheetahs, hyenas and a herd of Arabian oryx. There are also richly patterned axis deer stags, gazelles and blackbuck antelope. It’s not just land activities either – the island offers a range of scuba ing and snorkelling trips to delve further into Abu Dhabi’s abundant marine life.sirbaniyasislandGo dolphin spottingAbu Dhabi’s coastal waters are home to the largest population of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins and plenty of bottlenose dolphins. Get out on the waves to see them in their natural habitat on a three-hour Dolphin Bay eco boat tour with marine biologist Arabella Willing (Saturdays, £76 per person). As well as learning all about the local environment, you’ll sail out to the Dolphin Bay sandbank for swimming and snorkelling. Late March to July is the best time for dolphin spotting, especially in the early mornings and evenings.captaintonys.aeSeek out an urban oasisYou can even experience the UAE’s lush nature in the centre of the city of Al Ain. The Unesco world heritage visitor experience, Al Ain Oasis is an hour and a half from Abu Dhabi and its 100 different varieties of date palms provide plenty of shade from the urban heat. Covering a vast 1,214 hectares (3,000 acres), it features a series of oasis gardens, running from the orchard garden – which is filled with fragrant scents of fig, lemon, pomegranate and olive trees – to the symbolic garden, whose moringa and frankincense trees are known for their medicinal properties.visitabudhabi.aeFeed a falconThe sport of falconry is held in very high esteem in Emirati culture, with skills being passed down through the generations. The popular Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital is the largest falcon hospital in the world, acting almost like a regular hospital, with birds being assessed on arrival. Each year, 11,200 falcons are received for examinations and treatment. The site opens its doors twice a day for the public to tour the hospital, where they can get an insight into the work that is done there. Visitors will even get a chance to feed the falcons, and there’s a museum on site. You can also learn about the sport of falconry in the hospital’s landscaped gardens. falconhospitalExperience the real Abu Dhabi.

That is bigger than oil, gas, life sciences, automotive and aeronautics combined.”Deller said he had recently been in a new flagship academy at a meeting held in a room full of mirrors. He asked “what’s this” and was told the school had got rid of its dance teacher and now used the dance room for exams. “What a terrible thing for young people, what an incredible waste,” he said.He called the Ebacc “a huge mistake”, adding: “Thinking creatively is what is going to get Britain through a lot of the challenges of the next 10-20 years and that’s exactly what the arts do, they free up the mind.”Barlow, who taught in art schools from 1966 to 2009, said she had witnessed the erosion of the importance of the arts at all levels within education, especially over the last 15 to 20 years.“Without doubt, such ill thought through policies and attitude to the arts is a tragedy. People, young and old, are being deprived of the opportunities to discover their talents and abilities as artists and innovators within disciplines across the board.“This philistinism must stop for the sake of future generations and the survival of the planet.”Kapoor said it showed the UK was being “led by a bunch of halfwits, at best”.He said: “The fact that we enslave our young people as fodder, and educate them as fodder for this monument to capitalism is outrageous. In older times, and not so long ago, an education meant an education in the arts and music and the classics. Have we so lost our sense of what it means to be civilised that all we care about are subjects directed to the economy. What’s wrong with us?”The Ebacc performance measure makes the sciences, English language and literature, maths, a language and geography or history compulsory for secondary school pupils. Critics say that this has narrowed access to art or dance or music or drama as schools concentrate on core subjects.The letter adds to warnings made by many arts leaders. The former director of the National Theatre, Nicholas Hytner, called the Ebacc policy one of the “biggest disasters of the last seven years” and pointed with disdain to an assertion by the former education secretary Nicky Morgan that arts subjects could hold pupils back for years.A study from the Education Policy Institute thinktank last year found that the number of teenagers taking GCSEs in arts subjects had fallen to its lowest proportion for a decade. The promotion of the Ebacc suite of subjects was one reason for the fall, it said.The 104 signatories to the new letter include 15 former Turner prize winners including Lubaina Himid, Susan Philipsz, Richard Wright, Mark Wallinger, Grayson Perry, Wolfgang Tillmans and Gillian Wearing.A department for Education spokesperson said: “Our drive to ensure all pupils benefit from a stretching core academic curriculum through the Ebacc is not a barrier to pupils enjoying a high-quality arts education. In fact, since the introduction of the Ebacc the percentage of pupils taking arts GCSEs has remained stable.“We are investing nearly £500m in music and arts education programmes between 2016 and 2020. This includes the recent announcement of £96m to help talented pupils to attend prestigious arts institutions, such as the Royal Ballet School in London and Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f915ef8fd0c22ff7af07eb6390b8038180c415a1/0_117_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fffdf28b33c841ece467e3c9bc4b5d44","title":"south georgia declared rat free centuries rodent devastation","story":"World’s biggest project to kill off invasive species to protect native wildlife is hailed a successThe world’s biggest project to eradicate a dangerous invasive species has been declared a success, as the remote island of South Georgia is now clear of the rats and mice that had devastated its wildlife for nearly 250 years.Rats and mice were inadvertently introduced to the island, off the southern tip of South America and close to Antarctica, by ships that stopped there, usually on whaling expeditions. The effect on native bird populations was dramatic. Unused to predators, they laid their eggs on the ground or in burrows, easily accessible to the rodents.Two species of birds unique to the island, the South Georgia pipit and pintail, were largely confined to a few tiny islands off the coast, which the rodents could not reach, and penguins and other seabird populations were also threatened.The last of the poisoned bait was dropped more than two years ago, but scientists have spent the intervening period monitoring the island for rodents. Two experienced dog handlers from New Zealand walked three dogs – named Will, Ahu and Wai – across nearly 1,550 miles (2,500km) in often extreme weather, beset by heavy rain and often fierce storms, seeking out signs of rats and mice.Only when none were found over the whole period and in every area was the project deemed a success according to international standards. The leaders of the eradication effort declared the island free of rats and mice on Wednesday, and said the air resounded with the once-rare song of the native pipit.The project was led by the South Georgia Heritage Trust, a charity set up to protect the island, and an associate organisation, the US-based Friends of South Georgia Island. The UK government also played a role, but the bulk of the funding came from private fundraising and philanthropy.Scientists hope the success could become an inspiration and model for other projects around the world to eliminate invasive species, which in the worst cases can drive native animals close to extinction.The South Georgia programme involved dropping hundreds of tonnes of poisoned bait on areas known to be infested with rodents. Harsh weather, mountainous terrain and the island’s limited accessibility made the project fraught with danger.At times, when scientists believed they had eradicated rats from one area, they returned from another nearby section of the island, meaning the poisoning regime had to begin again. Richardson paid tribute to the teams’ endurance and bravery.South Georgia, one of the UK’s numerous overseas territories, was first noted by Captain Cook in 1775 on one of his voyages of discovery. It became a stop for the hundreds of whalers which plied the southern seas, providing shelter, dry land and a meeting site for ships that may have spent weeks or months without sight of land. About 2,000 people lived on the island during whaling’s heyday, but today the main activities are centred on two scientific research stations run by the British Antarctic Survey. It was claimed for Argentina during the Falklands war, and a UK garrison was only withdrawn in 2001. The island is also known as the burial ground of the Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton, who died there in 1922.About 100 miles long, the island covers about 350,000 hectares (865,000 acres) and much of it is covered in snow and ice. The remainder is very mountainous. Some of the coastal regions have vegetation, which has provided a haven for seabirds, and the pipits and pintails.Invasive species are one of the worst threats to bioersity around the world. When non-native species are introduced, often inadvertently but also sometimes as pets or ornamental features, they can disrupt natural ecosystems evolved over millennia to the detriment of the native species. One classic example is the grey squirrel, introduced to Europe as a novelty and which has come close to eclipsing the native red in the UK. It was thought this was mainly because the more aggressive greys outcompeted the reds for habitats and food, but more recently scientists have discovered that a virus called squirrelpox, to which the natives have little resistance, also played a leading role."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f316043573efcb83ae38674111847cc13285a400/0_0_2264_1359/master/2264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34aef54510230c7490145c989bacca47","title":"use excess wind and solar power to produce hydrogen report","story":"With more electricity often generated than needed the excess could be utilised to generate the green power sourceGreen energy would be boosted if excess electricity from wind and solar farms was used to produce hydrogen for use in heating and other parts of the energy system, according to engineers.Renewables were the UK’s second biggest source of electricity in the last three months of 2017, and now provide about a third of the country’s power at certain times of day.National Grid has warned that at times this summer there will be more electricity being generated than needed when demand is low, solar output is high and some inflexible power stations are hard to turn off.With a significant number of large new offshore windfarms due to come online over the next few years, the challenge of balancing supply and demand will continue to grow.The Institution of Mechanical Engineers (iMechE) said the answer could be to use the power to generate hydrogen. Electricity would be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, with the hydrogen functioning as a form of energy storage for renewables. The gas would later be blended in with normal gas supplies for heating supplies, sent to fuel cells to generate electricity, or used for topping up hydrogen vehicles, iMechE said in a report backed by the gas industry.Dr Jenifer Baxter, the report’s lead author, said: “We are seeing continued expansion of renewables. If we’ve got a lot of low-carbon power, we want to make sure we’re using all of that.”The engineering group urged the government to bring the renewables, nuclear and gas industries together to work on “power to gas”, and encourage demonstration projects. The nuclear trade association welcomed the report.The iMechE also called for a government study into the environmental impact of lithium-batteries, which have been deployed on a large scale recently and offer an alternative way of storing energy.Last year the government gave much more backing to batteries, with the announcement of £246m for battery research and development, compared with £25m to explore using hydrogen for heating.Asked if the economics of hydrogen stacked up, Baxter said electricity was getting cheaper while electrolysers – used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen – were getting more efficient. Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said the report was good but cautioned it was pushing a very pro-gas agenda on how best to decarbonise heating, when there was still a lot of debate over the most cost-effective and feasible technologies.The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said there are not yet any obvious ways that the technologies could achieve major reductions in cost."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/267727d6c52c0ac1a386add3cfe9555d4f974085/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=490ca23cb4113a75caaa64454ca7930a","title":"footwear rules for summer the heel is the new toe","story":"Pumice stones at the ready … from the arty mule to the holiday slipper, here are some of the best examples of the heel-flashing trendGetting ready for that summer pedicure? No, me neither. But there is good news for those who identify as lazy when it comes to their feet. This season, toes will be a rare site in fashionable circles, and toe cleavage is practically illegal, according to the denizens of the front row. This year’s look is all about the closed-toe mule, you see. A quick swipe with the pumice stone is all you need. Here are four of the most fashionable heel-flashers around.When Maria Grazia Chiuri came to Dior in July 2016, she put feminism front and centre of her own new look. Ballet flats, it’s fair to say, are a bit too cutesy to scream intersectionality or any other zeitgeisty term. Instead, Chiuri gave them a rework by tweaking the bow to the side of the shoe, adding a point to the front and emancipating your heels. Other brands have followed suit. Meet your take-you-everywhere summer shoe - that includes marching on anti-Trump protests, obvs.Asos has a whole category entitled “holiday shoes”. We like its style. The backless loafer introduced by Gucci – complete with shearling – in 2015 has morphed into the kind of shoes that demand attention, or at least a rooftop and a caipirinha before lunch. Maximalist styles ranging from XL pompoms to rainbow stripes are all invited, and all on the high street, too.Anyone who follows Simon Porte Jacquemus on Instagram will find not employing the adjective “adorable” tricky. Paris’s golden boy, who posts videos of tulips on bicycles and donkeys on the beach, along with himself in oversized picture hats, has also had a hand in making shoes with heels that could quite easily pass in a Ettore Sottsass exhibition. Topshop and other brands are exploring other heel shapes. Expect ball-heeled mules at gallery openings this summer.It doesn’t get much better than your shoe of choice enjoying the Marilyn Monroe seal of approval. The actor wore slingbacks in that 1955 subway grate scene in The Seven Year Itch. OK, those were open-toed, but 2018’s version has all the mid-century charm without any toe issues. Prada’s came with punk attitude but gingham gives a bit of classic wholesomeness that the 50s would totally get.

But from Rihanna’s pope to Lena Waithe’s rainbow-flag cape, the opening night ball was a triumphIt took curator Andrew Bolton several years to convince the Vatican to give its blessing to Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, the blockbuster show at the politan Museum in New York that explores ine inspiration in fashion. One imagines Rome’s reluctance stemmed from concern that the exhibition – and particularly the opening night gala, which has become known for its outrageous outfits – would trivialise religious imagery.It needn’t have worried. Fashion takes clothes very, very seriously. In a world in which dressing up matters and sartorial symbolism carries a very real weight, the Met Gala is the most important night of the year. Even when it looks absurd to outsiders – remember the omelette dress of 2015? – the fashion seen on the Met Gala red carpet has been considered and planned with the solemnity of a papal conclave. In their Manhattan hotel rooms, celebrities dress for this event with a level of meticulous ceremony which would befit a Sunday at St Peters.This year’s dress code was a challenge. To succeed on this red carpet required honouring the theme of Catholicism in fashion without being seen to make fun of it. What is special about the Met red carpet – by comparison, for instance, with Cannes – is that you can’t win it just by looking good. A supermodel can wear a tight dress and high heels and sail through almost every other public occasion with flying colours, but that look is a fast track to being completely ignored at the Met. You have to dig deep for this night, because Met Gala triumph requires not just beauty but bravery and a leap of faith. The Vatican would surely approve.The obvious link between the world presided over by Pope Francis and the one ruled by Queen Anna Wintour is that clothing delineates status. Rihanna attacked this theme with her signature fearlessness and blew everyone else out of the water. In the season of the first Millicent Fawcett statue and of a Christian Dior slogan T-shirt namechecking Linda Nochlin’s feminist essay “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists”, RiRi gave us a female pope. She wore a heavily embellished mini dress under a matching cloak, accessorised with a pointed mitre, stiletto heels and pearls strung around one ankle – because, after all, there’s not always room for a rosary in a clutch bag – all created for her by John Galliano for the house of Maison Margiela. The look was a version of an ensemble designed by Galliano during his time at Christian Dior that appeared on the catwalk in 2000 worn by a man, and is included in the Met exhibition.But clothes are never only about power, either in fashion or in the church. Beauty as a metaphor for human goodness runs through the history of art, through religious iconography and through the way fashion worships at the altar of beauty and glamour. Katy Perry was a triumph in Versace. In a gold dress and boots, and with a 6ft white feathered wing, she was arguably the most breathtaking representation of the archangel Gabriel since Fra Angelico painted the Annunciation fresco in the Convent of San Marco. (And yes, I do realise how sacrilegious that is, in artistic terms.)Sienna Miller in gold and white Louis Vuitton was also ine as another Renaissance angel on the red carpet.The transactional business of fashion is a multimillion-pound industry precisely because it taps into powerful emotions and desires. Fashion deliberately blurs the boundaries between things that you have the power to change and the things you don’t. (You can buy the perfect party dress, but you can’t actually buy romance or joy or fun.) Religious imagery has long employed the same porous boundaries, conjuring the invisible into life. The word halo – an accessory seen last night on Solange Knowles in Iris Van Herpen and Lily Collins in Givenchy, among others – means glory. And the aesthetic of papal garments has roots in worldly power, as well as spiritual. When the Emperor Constantine moved his capital east to Constantinople and allowed the pontiffs to assume control the old capital, Rome, they incorporated some of the clothing and accessories worn by the Roman emperors who had ruled before them, the better to legitimise their power in the eyes of the people of Rome.Like all the best dress codes, the Met Gala invitation allowed for lots of iniduality. Frances McDormand consolidated her role as 2018’s designated maverick by coming as “a pagan”, she said on the red carpet, in her Valentino butterfly headdress. Those actors who have pledged vows to fashion houses (or at least, signed contracts with them) showed their constancy with looks that mined clerical robes for the most this-season silhouette.

Kate Moss wore a black dress with a feathered black neckline that nodded to the dress code with a fallen-angel vibe – this was her first appearance in the US since 2009, and there was speculation that the prolonged absence was due to difficulty procuring a visa after the drug scandal of 2005 – but mainly referenced herself.

Manolo Gabbiadini was the player who set that chain of events in motion with a goal that was scrappy and untidy but worth its weight in gold to Mark Hughes and his players.“We are staying up,” chanted the Southampton fans as the players joined hands to celebrate in front of them at the final whistle. Hughes was as pumped up as anyone as he strode on to the pitch without shaking hands with Carlos Carvalhal, clenching his fist and embracing the players who have taken Saints to the verge of safety.Swansea were crestfallen. They are three points adrift with only one game left and will need to beat Stoke at home on Sunday and hope Huddersfield lose their final two fixtures, against Chelsea and Arsenal, to have any chance of staying up. On this evidence there is little chance of Swansea keeping their side of that bargain.The Carvalhal revival has crashed and burned. Swansea have failed to win in nine matches and this was the eighth home game of the season in which they have not scored. They are toothless in attack and Carvalhal’s negative approach over the last couple of months – he has become obsessed with playing five at the back – has done nothing to help their cause.Hughes read the script in that respect. Southampton sat deep initially, defending in numbers, and effectively asked Swansea to break them down. As has been the case so often Swansea struggled to do so, and there was always a feeling Southampton had the wherewithal to punish them at the other end, especially when they started to attack with more conviction after the break.The goal arrived in the 72nd minute and it was a desperately poor one to concede. Dusan Tadic’s corner was headed back across goal by the unmarked Shane Long, it was flicked on again by Oriol Romeu and although Lukasz Fabianski managed to keep out Charlie Austin’s shot, Gabbiadini was perfectly positioned to sweep home from inside the six-yard box four minutes after coming on.Hughes said he had always planned to introduce Gabbiadini at some stage, and the Southampton manager made it clear he had felt this was a must-win game because Saints face Manchester City on the final day.A heavy defeat against City and an emphatic Swansea win could still see Hughes’s team relegated in theory, yet nobody can realistically expect a nine-goal swing in the respective fixtures.For Hughes, victory was particularly sweet because of some of the shenanigans that went on before the game. The Swansea hotel Southampton planned to stay in was cancelled at short notice on Sunday, forcing Hughes and his players to find alternative accommodation in Cardiff, and there was more frustration for the visitors when they arrived at the Liberty Stadium and were told they would have to wait on the bus.Hughes had had enough at that point and instructed his players to leave the team coach and walk the 100 yards or so to the entrance.Although the atmosphere crackled inside the Liberty Stadium in the early stages the game was something of a slowburner. Swansea had plenty of possession and tried to dictate the tempo but they created little going forward.Andy King’s low drive was comfortably saved by Alex McCarthy and Sam Clucas’s glancing header fell the wrong side of the far upright but that was the sum total of Swansea’s threat before the interval and it was difficult to know what opportunities Carvalhal was referring to afterwards when he talked about his team creating plenty of chances.Swansea’s best moment came at the start of the second half and that was down to a piece of inidual inspiration from Jordan Ayew. Twisting and turning to wriggle clear of a couple of Southampton players, Ayew cut inside and unleashed a 25-yard dipping shot that looked to be arcing into the top corner until Alex McCarthy, stretching every sinew, got a hand to the ball to superbly flick it over the bar.Southampton were starting to look more and more menacing. Austin had forced Fabianski to make two saves before half-time and another couple of attempts from the same player highlighted the visitors’ growing threat.Desperate for a goal, Carvalhal introduced Tammy Abraham, but it was the change made by Hughes that did the trick as Gabbiadini, who has endured a difficult season, joined Long and Austin in a three-pronged attack.All three were involved in that defining moment and, although it will never make a contender for goal of the season, it could well go down as the most important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd52d485570022c8d9d33498b83449df3502dee2/0_82_5075_3045/master/5075.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eab852b585ae9345f222c3a00bdca86","title":"government facing possible defeat in press regulation votes","story":"Theresa May tells cabinet two amendments to data protection bill will undermine free pressThe government is facing two difficult votes, and potential defeats, over amendments to the data protection bill that are due to be debated in the Commons on Wednesday. The amendments would establish a “Leveson two” inquiry into the misuse of personal data by the media, and a measure that would impose punitive legal costs on English media organisations that refuse to sign-up to an officially recognised press regulator. At present, the only such regulator is Impress. The second amendment, tabled by the Labour MPs Tom Watson and Liam Byrne, has prompted a robust response from media organisations who fear it would have a chilling effect on investigative journalism in the public interest. Under their proposal, publishers who had not signed up to Impress would be forced to pay the legal costs of claimants who brought legal proceedings against a news outlet, even if the publisher won the case. Theresa May told cabinet ministers on Tuesday morning that the plans would undermine the free press and it was “very important” that the government oppose the amendments. She said the government remained committed to a voluntary system of independent press regulation. News \u0026amp Media, the owner of the  and the Observer, has written to all MPs, warning that the proposed amendment on section 40 would “further erode press freedom and have a severe chilling effect”.GNM also said it rejected a plan, contained in the proposal tabled by Watson and Byrne, that would exempt media organisations which reinvest their profits back into journalism from paying punitive legal costs.It appeared that GNM would effectively be the only media organisation to benefit from this proposal.“This clause was not discussed with  News \u0026amp Media and we disagree with attempts to impose a selective sanction on the media,” the publisher told MPs in a briefing note.“We do not believe that singling out one model of ownership for news organisations in this way is a constructive approach. This amendment implies that just one ownership model can result in the production of high quality journalism, which is simply not correct.”Following a weekend of press reports suggesting GNM would benefit from the proposals, Watson attempted to clarify his position by saying the clause was never meant to capture the publisher. “ is not covered by this exemption and that was never the intention,” a Labour spokesperson said. “The exemption is for independent local newspapers and not-for-profit organisations.”The proposal for a fresh Leveson-style public inquiry into the activities of media companies is contained in an amendment to the data protection bill tabled by a cross-party group of MPs, including Labour’s Ed Miliband and the Conservative Ken Clarke.The original Leveson inquiry, which began in 2011 following the phone-hacking scandal, was always meant to include two parts. The first part, which investigated the culture and ethics of the press, was completed, but earlier this year the government confirmed it would not push ahead with the second part, which was due to focus on relationships between the media and the police.Miliband and Clarke’s amendment would require the government to establish another inquiry, with a mandate that echoes the original plan for Leveson part two while also expanding the scope to include social media companies. Among other issues, the new inquiry would be mandated to investigate unlawful use of data by large media publishers, consider whether there should be reporting restrictions on police investigations where no charges have been brought, and investigate the role of social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, in spreading dubious information.Labour and government sources said they expected the votes to be tight, with Conservatives more minded to back Clarke’s call for a new inquiry than vote for Watson’s proposal to impose punitive costs on publishers.The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We have set out the importance of these votes and of the government resisting those amendments and we would hope that when MPs come to consider these amendments, they will look at the strength of the case we’ve put forward.”However, Downing Street sources said they were bracing themselves for a defeat on the inquiry amendment. “It’s going to be really difficult,” one said. And they believed the vote on punitive costs was going to be “tight”, with questions remaining over how the Democratic Unionist party will vote and whether some Tories might abstain.The sources said they were aware of a handful of Tory MPs who were planning to rebel against the three-line whip, with Clarke leading the charge. Whips were concentrating on persuading backbenchers who had indicated they would abstain to vote against the amendments instead. The Scottish National party’s 35-strong Westminster group was meeting late on Tuesday to decide how to vote. The party has previously ruled out forcing the Scottish press to sign up to a state-approved regulator.The prime minister’s spokesman said: “Almost £50m of public money has already been spent on investigating phone-hacking, and establishing a further public inquiry requiring great time and expense is not a proportionate solution to allegations which have already been the subject of several extensive police investigations or ongoing investigations by the Information Commissioner’s Office.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8875b37c7868bcb0e835bb5c3c27b0cc1d232c01/0_202_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f58b2b8450bbbc2b9e3ef24010d11bc","title":"pool basement wealth super rich digging down london","story":"In London’s richest boroughs vast subterranean enclaves are being carved out over several floors to house cars, wine, saunas and private nightclubs. How did underground living – once associated with poverty and disease – become an investment scheme for the uber-wealthy?With its eclectic fusion of Regency and mythological motifs, Havona House stands out amid the stucco-fronted Victorian townhouses in Notting Hill’s Pembridge Villas. The newly built mansion’s mock neoclassical columns and the limestone carvings of Greek deities on the facade reflect the roots of its owner, property investor Costas Diamantopoulos. Stepping inside the 8,600 sq ft (800 sq m) property, which is on the market for £25m, you are confronted by an array of opulent features, including a free-floating stone staircase, hand-blown glass pendants and marble en-suite bathrooms.If your neighbourhood has been affected by basement developments, or you own one or have been involved in their construction, and have experienced any of the issues in this story or similar, we would like to hear from you.

On its first floor is an underground garage, in which up to three cars can be parked via robotic platforms. On the lower floor is a 70ft swimming pool, which is filled by a waterfall that cascades over mirrored panels, with a cinema screen to the left. Mango onyx marble panels line the right-hand wall, with a Turkish bath, sauna, shower and a gym further on the other side. At the far end is a £30,000 plaster sculpture of four dancing figures, based on a painting by Poussin. The artwork also hints at the room’s special feature: at the push of a button, hidden hydraulic legs raise the ceramic-tiled floor to transform the space into a dancefloor. “In four to five minutes you can go from having a pool to a huge area of entertainment,” says Diamantopoulos.This is the second basement development Diamantopoulos has built in London in 10 years. He oversaw a much smaller one in 2008 under his former home in Cheyne Place, opposite the Chelsea Physic Garden, although it, too, has a pool, cinema screen, gym and sauna. This property is also for sale, for a comparatively modest £12m, under the terms of Diamantopoulos’s orce settlement. But he says his family regularly congregated in the basement when it was their main residence. He would swim in the oval blue-tiled pool, inspired by his childhood memories of the Greek islands, making use of the wave machine, or relax in the sauna, while his older daughter and her friends would use the gym. “If someone has the space and the ability, I would always recommend a basement,” he says.As decadent as they may seem, the features of Diamantopoulos’s basements are typical of many of those built under central London’s most exclusive neighbourhoods in the past decade, according to a new study by Newcastle University’s global urban research unit. The report, Mapping Subterranean London: the Hidden Geography of Residential Basement Developments, found at least 4,650 basements were granted planning permission in Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Camden, Islington and Wandsworth between 2008 and 2017. According to their planning applications, these schemes boast at least 376 swimming pools, 456 cinemas, 996 gyms, 381 wine stores and cellars, 340 games and recreation rooms, 241 saunas or steam rooms, 115 staff quarters, including bedrooms for nannies and au pairs, 65 garages, 40 libraries, two gun stores, a car museum, a banquet hall and an artificial beach.The vast amount of extra space built under prime London properties contrasts starkly with the shrinking size of newly built homes bought by average families. For example, living rooms are nearly a third smaller than equivalent homes built in the 1970s, falling from 268 sq ft in the 1970s to 184 sq ft in a house built since 2010, according to another recent study. Burrows says: “One cannot but be struck by how the amount of living space different households have available to them differs now. In our research we have come across some basement developments in central London where just the pool, gym and cinema combined are larger than the newbuild rabbit-hutch homes that many people have to put up with.”Nowhere is this more evident than in Kensington and Chelsea, the capital’s richest borough, which has about 4,900 UHNWIs, and has the highest number of large and mega-basements, often two or more storeys deep and extended under the garden. Beth Holroyd, co-author of the study, says variations in the scale and sumptuousness of basements reveal the wealth gap between London’s merely rich, such as corporate lawyers and accountants, and the global super-rich, including bankers and oligarchs. Holroyd says: “There is a clear pattern of association between the level of neighbourhood affluence and both the size and extravagance of the basements. The pool is a clear marker of wealth.”On Tregunter Road, in the Boltons conservation area of Chelsea renowned for its Italianate Victorian housing, the researchers found 22 approved basements, with features including 12 swimming pools and five cinemas. Five of these basements are standard-sized, 11 are classified as large and six as mega. One of the mega-basements, with a pool, gym and car lift, is in an 8,000 sq ft townhouse on the market for £26m. Four of the basements are currently under construction. Outside one, a huge red crane lowers building materials into the rear garden, under which, planning documents suggest, a two-storey basement with a pool, cinema, gym, wine store, steam room, salon and staff room is being created. Another two-storey basement with almost identical features is being excavated under a house across the street.“I can see that from my garden,” says local resident Shirley, who lives round the corner on the Boltons, gesturing at the crane with her walking stick. “We’ve had something like that or worse going on for years. We’ve had incredible noise and vibrations. I’m sure there have been momentary gaps. Our feeling is it’s too extreme. Very wealthy people buy them hoping to get the price rise and do them up and sell them and the next person does the same. Only a few of them are here all the time.”Alistair Langhorne and Claire Bunten, directors of LAB Architects, have been designing basements in the Boltons conservation area since 2008. On a tour of the area, Langhorne says that even here most of their clients want a basement to enhance their family life, rather than for property speculation – although Bunten admits that the budgets for some schemes were “otherworldly”. “They’ve all probably got homes elsewhere in the world but this is their main residence,” adds Langhorne.The basement boom began in the late 1990s in Hammersmith and Fulham and Wandsworth, according to architects and developers, with middle-class families renovating their Victorian coal cellars. Excavations became more substantial as planning constraints made building above ground in central London extremely difficult, while, from 2010 onwards, stamp duty rises on property purchases over £1m made the costs of moving prohibitive, forcing owners to expand downwards. Only 23 of the basements the Newcastle researchers identified in these boroughs have pools – compared with 224 in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea – and the vast majority are standard-sized – one storey under the footprint of the house.But Burrows believes that mega-basements will continue. “There will always be a few uber-wealthy types who seem immune to the vicissitudes of the economy, politics and local planning policies,” he says. “They always seem to find ways of getting around restrictions to build their luxury pools, galleries, cinemas or virtual reality golf courses. There may be fewer of those really massive basements now, but the trend is not finished yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee934959a12352384ae4580f97415c1357237b9/0_0_2228_1336/master/2228.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3da56b49049abf0e12e054a1950a94aa","title":"how the chicken nugget became the true symbol of our era","story":"This is what happens when you turn the natural world into a profit-making machine. By  Raj Patel and  Jason W MooreThe most telling symbol of the modern era isn’t the automobile or the smartphone. It’s the chicken nugget. Chicken is already the most popular meat in the US, and is projected to be the planet’s favourite flesh by 2020. Future civilisations will find traces of humankind’s 50 billion bird-a-year habit in the fossil record, a marker for what we now call the Anthropocene. And yet responsibility for the dramatic change in our consumption lies not so much in general human activity, but capitalism. Although we’re taught to understand it as an economic system, capitalism doesn’t just organise hierarchies of human work. Capitalism is what happens when power and money combine to turn the natural world into a profit-making machine. Indeed, the way we understand nature owes a great deal to capitalism.Every civilisation has had some rendering of the difference between “us” and “them”, but only under capitalism is there a boundary between “society” and “nature” – a violent and tightly policed border with deep roots in colonialism.First taking shape in the era of Chistopher Columbus, capitalism created a peculiar binary order. “Nature” became the antonym of “society” in the minds of philosophers, in the policies of European empires, and the calculations of global financial centres. “Nature” was a place of profit, a vast frontier of free gifts waiting to be accepted by conquerors and capitalists.This was a dangerous view of nature for all sorts of reasons, not least because it simultaneously degraded human and animal life of every kind. What we call “cheap nature” included not only forests and fields and streams, but also the vast majority of humankind. In the centuries between Columbus and the industrial revolution, enslaved and indentured Africans, Asians, indigenous peoples and virtually all women became part of “nature” – and treated cheaply as a result. When humans can be treated with such little care, it’s not surprising that other animals fare even worse under capitalism, especially the ones we end up paying to eat.Animals have been at the epicentre of five centuries of dietary transformation, which sharply accelerated after the second world war. The creation of the modern world depended on the movement of cattle, sheep, horses, pigs and chickens into the new world, reinforcing the murderous advance of microbes, soldiers and bankers after 1492. Capitalism’s “ecological hoofprint”, to use food scholar Tony Weis’s well-turned phrase, has become radically globalised ever since. In the half-century after 1961, Weis tells us, per capita meat and egg consumption has doubled, and the number of slaughtered animals leapt eightfold, from eight to 64 billion.To those with a romantic view of where their food comes from, uncooked meat appears to be a raw ingredient rather than a processed one. Quite the opposite. Feed and oilseed crops form part of what Weis terms “the industrial grain-oilseed-livestock complex”. Markets for grain made it possible for meat not just to become cheap food, but also to back financial instruments. Futures contracts in pork bellies, for instance, in turn require the uniformity, homogenisation and industrialisation of the crops they transform. Raw meat in the supermarket is, in other words, cooked up by a sophisticated and intensive arm of capitalism’s ecology.The environmental consequences of meat production are, of course, external to industrial agriculture’s bottom line. Nature is merely the pool from which animals are drawn and factory farmed, and the dump into which their, and our, waste disappears. The danger lies in believing the ision between nature and society is real, in seeing “factory farming” as an environmental question and “factory production” as a social question. Social questions are environmental questions, and vice versa.Chickens don’t turn into nuggets by themselves. Capitalists need cheap work. With the European invasion of the new world in 1492, that labour presented itself in the bodies of indigenous people. By the late 16th century, when Spaniards were desperately trying to revive silver production at the great silver mountain of Potosí, in present-day Bolivia, they began using the word naturales to refer to indigenous people. Through hard work and prayer, those indigenous people, and enslaved Africans, might find ine redemption through work and perhaps even, one day long in the future, entry into society as equals.Work was never meant to be fun. Consider the etymology of the French travail and the Spanish trabajo, each a translation of the English noun “work”: their Latin root is trepaliare, “to torture, to inflict suffering or agony.” But the way work works has changed.For millennia, most humans survived through more or less intimate relations with land and sea. Even those who didn’t were closely connected to the tasks and objects of labour. Human survival depended on holistic, not fragmented, knowledge: fishers, nomads, farmers, healers, cooks and many others experienced and practised their work in a way directly connected to the web of life. Farmers, for instance, had to know soils, weather patterns, seeds – in short, everything from planting to harvest. That didn’t mean work was pleasant – slaves were often treated brutally. Nor did it mean that the relations of work were equitable: guild masters exploited journeymen, lords exploited serfs, men exploited women, the old exploited the young. But work was premised on a holistic sense of production and a connection to wider worlds of life and community.In the 16th century, that began to shift. The enterprising Dutch or English farmer – and the Madeiran, then Brazilian, sugar planter – was increasingly connected to growing international markets for processed goods, and correspondingly more interested in the relationship between work time and the harvest. International markets pushed local transformations. Land in England was consolidated though enclosure, which concurrently “freed” a growing share of the rural population from the commons that they had tended, supported and survived on. These newly displaced peasants were free to find other work, and free to starve or face imprisonment if they failed.CAAIR’s recruits were predominantly young and white, but the majority of poultry workers are people of colour. Latinx immigrants are a vital force in US agriculture, and the delivery of their cheap work was made possible by class restructuring on two fronts. One, in the US, was a strong movement in the 1980s by newly aggressive meat-packing firms to destroy union power and replace unionised workers with low-wage immigrant labour. The other was the destabilisation of Mexico’s agrarian order after 1994 by the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which resulted in flows of cheap immigrant labour – unemployed workers displaced by capitalism’s ecology from one side of the US border to the other.A line on a map between two states is a powerful abstraction, one that has been used recently by the far right to recruit and spread fear, and for much longer by capitalists in search of ever cheaper and more profitable workers. Under capitalism, national territories, locally owned land and new migrating workers are produced simultaneously.With migrant workers came elite fears of the itinerant poor. In 17th- and 18th-century England, this panic resulted in harsh laws against vagabondage, and the development of charities to ameliorate the worst effects of enforced destitution. Threats of imprisonment moved the poor into waged work, an activity that took the intelligence, strength and dexterity of humans and disciplined them to productive labour using another modern invention: a new way of measuring time.If the practice of labour shapes capitalism’s ecology, its indispensable machine is the mechanical clock. The clock – not money – emerged as the key technology for measuring the value of work. This distinction is crucial because it’s easy to think that working for wages is capitalism’s signature. It’s not: in 13th-century England only a third of the economically active population depended on wages for survival. That wages have become a decisive way of structuring life, space and nature owes everything to a new model of time.By the early 14th century, the new temporal model was shaping industrial activity. In textile-manufacturing towns like Ypres, in what is now Belgium, workers found themselves regulated not by the flow of activity or the seasons but by a new kind of time – abstract, linear, repetitive. In Ypres, that work time was measured by the town’s bells, which rang at the beginning and end of each work shift. By the 16th century, time was measured in steady ticks of minutes and seconds. This abstract time came to shape everything – work and play, sleep and waking, credit and money, agriculture and industry, even prayer. By the end of the 16th century, most of England’s parishes had mechanical clocks.Spain’s conquest of the Americas involved inculcating in their residents a new notion of time as well as of space. Wherever European empires penetrated, there appeared the image of the “lazy” native, ignorant of the imperatives of Christ and the clock. Policing time was central to capitalism’s ecology. As early as 1553, the Spanish crown began installing “at least one public clock” in its major colonial cities. Other civilisations had their own sophisticated temporal rules, but the new regimes of work displaced indigenous tempos and relationships with the natural world. The Mayan calendar is a complex hierarchy of times and readings from the heavens, offering a rich set of arrangements of humans within the universe. Spanish invaders respected it only to this extent: they synchronised their colonial assaults to sacred moments in the calendar.As social historian EP Thompson observes in his seminal study Time, Work-Discipline and Industrial Capitalism, the governance of time follows a particular logic: “In mature capitalist society all time must be consumed, marketed, put to use it is offensive for the labour force merely to ‘pass the time’.” The connection of specific activities to larger productive goals didn’t allow for time theft, and the discipline of the clock was enforced by violence across the planet.Fights over the regulation of time continue even now. On US poultry lines, there is a federal law limiting the speed at which birds are processed: 140 birds per minute. The industry is lobbying to eliminate the limit, so that it can compete with factories in Brazil and Germany, where the rate is nearer 200 bpm. Worries about higher rates of food contamination and worker injury are being outweighed by the certain profit from more dead chickens.Capitalism has always experimented with every available kind of labour system simultaneously. A sugar plantation in 1630s Brazil, for example, would be easily recognisable as a modern industrial operation in, say, the Bangladeshi textile industry. Just as autoworkers on the line assemble simplified, interchangeable parts and fast-food workers manufacture standardised burgers, so did African slaves work specialised jobs in a simplified landscape of sugar monoculture.Behind the modern factory, there has always been a layer-cake of exploitation. Managers of factories were salaried more than the workers, who worked with raw materials acquired through various kinds of peonage and natural resource exploitation, and all of them depended on free domestic labour, usually from women. The global factory depends on a global mine, a global farm, and a global family.Hence the persistence today of slavery. One UN agency, the International Labour Organization, estimates there are 40 million people in slavery today, the majority of whom are women, many in forced marriages. Wartime work camps in, say, the Democratic Republic of the Congo supply the rare-earth metals such as tantalum that power the physical infrastructure behind the virtual economy.But just as management looks to find new ways to generate profit, so workers find ways to resist. Early capitalism’s great commodity frontiers – of sugar, silver, copper, iron, forest products, fishing and even cereal agriculture – were zones of experimentation in strategies of labour control in Europe and its colonies, and always spaces of conflict. Strikes, rebellions, negotiations and resistance characterised the application of capitalist work disciplines. Every resistance by labour was a new reason to bring in machines. Modern work regimes and technologies emerged from the crucible of experiments, strategies and resistances of early modern workers.Worker unrest in factories and slave rebellions, past and present, are linked not just because they are expressions of resistance, but because they are protests against the ecology of capitalism. Every global factory needs a global farm: industrial, technological and service enterprises rely on the extraction of work and cheap nature to thrive. The apps on your iPhone, designed in Cupertino, California, might have been coded by self-exploiting independent software engineers, and the phone itself assembled in draconian workplaces in China, and run on minerals extracted in inhumane conditions in the Congo. Modern manufacturing relies on layered, simultaneous and different regimes of work. And in response to every act of resistance against it, capitalism has moved the frontiers of work yet again.Hegemony over workers has been aided by cheap food, and the promise of a chicken in every pot. Cheap food has been central to the maintenance of order for millennia. But in the ecology of capitalism, that order has been maintained through planetary transformation.Since the 15th century, some land has become the exclusive domain of specific kinds of crops and crop systems: fields of monocultures designed to bring in flows of cash. Other areas were reserved to house those humans who had been excommunicated from those lands, to be better placed at the service of capitalists in cities. It was always a socially unstable geography, with low industrial wages supported by lower peasant wages supported by free gifts from nature, women and the colonies. After the revolutions of the 19th and 20th centuries offered workers the promise of alternatives to exploitation, capitalist fears of urban uprising and communism reached fever pitch. To allay this existential dread, governments and foundations did not address inequality or exploitation. Instead, they funded the development of crops that would grow abundantly enough to provide cheap food and curb urban hunger.That it was urban, and not rural, hunger that troubled policy makers is vitally important. Food and employment for people in rural areas – where most of the world’s hunger was concentrated – were of little concern. Hunger began to matter politically only when the poor came to the cities and translated it into anger, and thence potentially into insurrection and a challenge to the rule of cheap nature. It’s here – in the bourgeois concern about that rule and its need for worker quiescence – that we find the origin of what came to be known as the Green Revolution.The aim was to breed varieties of cereals that might flow freely through urban areas. But the revolution wasn’t simply an agronomic transformation. It required more than magic seeds. In order for farmers to grow the crops, national governments had to subsidise the purchase of crops through agricultural marketing boards, to lay the infrastructure for irrigation, and to suppress political dissent around alternative food systems. The Green Revolution of the early- to mid-20th century was a package of reforms designed to prevent the revolutionary political goal of many peasants’ and landless workers’ movements: comprehensive land and agrarian reform.But the prodigious output did not reduce hunger. Wheat production in India soared, but the amount that Indians ate hardly improved. Hunger, particularly in an economy dependent on agriculture, doesn’t end if people remain poor: it doesn’t matter how much grain there is if you can’t afford to buy it. Indeed, it is a global phenomenon that from 1990 to 2015, prices of processed food rose far less than those of fresh fruits and vegetables, and that in almost every country today, the poorest part of the population can’t afford to eat five fresh fruits or vegetables a day.Although workers in countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) saw an increase in their share of national income after the second world war, that reversed in the 1980s. This was a direct consequence of anti-labour policies that scholars aptly call “wage repression”. Given consistently low wages in the neoliberal era, it mak0es sense to look at cheap food as cheap not merely relative to wage costs but directly in terms of price. When we do, it emerges as no accident that one foodstuff whose price has fallen dramatically is chicken in Mexico – a direct consequence of Nafta, technology and the US soybean industry.Nafta originally excluded agricultural goods, but they were included at the insistence of the Mexican government, which wanted to “modernise” its peasantry by moving them from agriculture into urban circuits of industry. The strategy worked: Mexico’s campesino (“peasant farmer”) agricultural economy buckled, as evinced by the El Campo No Aguanta Más (“the countryside can’t take it anymore”) protests that spread throughout the country in 2003. Circuits of migration and pools of labour for US agriculture were the result. But at least the chicken was cheap.The imagery of the frontier lends itself to thinking only about land. But the past two centuries have witnessed a very different kind of frontier movement: the enclosure of the atmospheric commons as a dumping ground for greenhouse gas emissions. In the 21st century, agriculture and forestry (which includes land clearance for cash cropping) contribute between a quarter and a third of greenhouse gas emissions.This is inevitable, because they’re profoundly energy- intensive, and have become more so. That’s a big problem, because there are no more atmospheric commons to enclose, and no obvious way to keep the costs of climate change off capitalism’s ledgers. Nowhere is this clearer than in the faltering global farm, whose productivity growth has been slowing, just as it did for English farmers in the middle of the 18th century. Agro-biotechnology’s promise of a new agricultural revolution has so far been worse than empty – failing to deliver a new yield boom, creating superweeds and superbugs that can withstand glyphosate and other poisons, and sustaining the cheap food model that is driving the ongoing state shift in the world’s climate system.There is little reason to imagine that climate change won’t break the modern food system. Worse, industrial food production is a breeding ground for pandemic disease, and reasoned analysis suggests that the kind of concentrated animal-feeding operations that bring us cheap meat will also bring viruses that could decimate the human population. Again, this is nothing new. Just as early-modern climate change and the plague brought about the end of feudalism and the beginning of capitalism, so we face a future in which climate change and a vulnerability to big systemic shocks augur a dramatic end for capitalism’s ecology.We’re astute enough students of history to see that what follows capitalism might not be better. Around the world, fascism has emerged from liberalism’s soil. Yet precisely as capitalism’s bills come due, communities are both resisting and developing complex and systemic responses at capitalism’s frontiers. Around each of the seven cheap things that make capitalism possible – nature, work, care, food, energy, money and lives – there are movements that are developing alternatives. Whether in a globally reviving labour movement, in the Movement for Black Lives’ demands around food, reparations and local economic sovereignty, or the feminismo campesino y popular (“popular peasant feminism”) developed by the La Via Campesina peasant movement in Latin America to bring together concerns around food, care, nature and work, movements are both fighting and developing intersectional alternatives.John Jordan, an activist and co-founder of the UK’s Reclaim the Streets movement, argues that resistance and alternatives are “the twin strands of the DNA of social change”. That change will need resources and space to develop. If we are made by capitalism’s ecology, then we can be remade only as we in turn practise new ways of producing and caring for one another together – a process of redoing, rethinking and reliving our most basic relations.Adapted from A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things by Raj Patel and Jason W Moore, published by Verso on 22 May, and available to buy at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03e04ea401c8b8f3038ec8dee1230bfca649cfc6/117_550_3590_2154/master/3590.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3721ff51c8409ca0d77479ef89e4c1c2 1300w","title":"labour peers force may to give mps vote over single market plans","story":"More than 80 Labour peers defy whip on amendment calling for vote on EEA membershipMPs will have a vote on remaining in the European Economic Area – effectively a vote on the single market – after a shock defeat for the government in the Lords.It means the Brexit strategy of both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn has been blown apart in the past 24 hours.The rebel Labour amendment in the Lords opened the prospect of a Commons vote on the EEA – a less stringent version of the single market – after 83 Labour peers voted against the party whip. Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP who co-chairs a pro-European Commons committee with the Conservative Anna Soubry, said the leadership would now have to come off the fence and make it clear where it stood. “The time for constructive ambiguity is over – our members and our voters will be delighted with this clear signal that we will not go along with this Tory Brexit,” he said.The EU’s single market is more than a free-trade area. It aims to remove not just the fiscal barriers to trade (tariffs) but the physical and technical barriers (borders and ergent product standards) too by allowing as free movement as possible of goods, capital, services and people. In essence, it is about treating the EU as a single trading territory.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.The vote came hours after Boris Johnson called the prime minister’s proposal for a customs partnership “crazy” in an interview with the Daily Mail that dealt a major blow to the government’s strategy of a cautious balance between leave and remain. Johnson was the subject of fierce criticism from within Tory ranks all day. In the Lords debate the former Tory MP Patrick Cormack asked: “What sort of example are we being given by a cabinet that is rent asunder by the foreign secretary, the second most important cabinet minister, rubbishing the prime minister in the columns of the Daily Mail?”On the key EEA amendment, Labour peers were whipped to abstain. But 83 defied the whip to back the amendment, including a former party leader, many former ministers and a former chief whip. Seventeen Conservatives also backed the amendment.It was the third defeat of the afternoon for the government and an unexpected triumph for a cross-party group that included Waheed Alli for Labour, the Conservative peer Sandip Verma and the crossbench peer Karan Bilimoria.All the amendments to the bill that have been passed in the Lords will have to be considered and voted on by MPs when the bill returns to the Commons, perhaps as soon as next week. Lord Alli told the House that continued membership of the EEA was vital to ensure the future profitability of the UK’s export business and the jobs and livelihoods of many thousands of people. “It is the EEA that deals with services, services like retail, tourism, transport, communications, financial services and aerospace where we have a £14bn trade surplus,” he said.“The customs union only will benefit our European neighbours in their imports and without an EEA equivalent it will damage our profitable export business.” In a rowdy and sometimes ill-tempered debate peers, many of whom had been debating the EU for the past 30 years, argued passionately for and against EEA membership.Officially Labour opposed the Alli amendment because other amendments gave MPs a role in the negotiations. But the leadership will now have to face the tension between its strongly pro-remain rank and file membership, its largely pro-remain MPs and the policy consequences of remaining in any arrangement with Europe such as the EEA, which limits its plans for greater state involvement in the economy.The Tories are now likely to try to brand Labour as the party of free movement, which is one of the obligations of EEA membership. The threat of higher EU migration is likely to alarm Labour voters in some parts of the country. A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesperson said: “The referendum was a vote to take control of our borders, laws and money. Ongoing participation in the EEA would mean having to implement new EU legislation automatically and in its entirety without having a say on how it is formulated – and it would also mean continued free movement. We will now consider the implications of this decision.”Peter Mandelson, the former trade secretary and one-time EU trade commissioner, said ministers were perpetrating a “Brexit fraud’ by pretending that migration from the EU, which would continue under membership of the EEA, would end after the UK left.“The time has come for economic reality and commonsense to prevail over wishful thinking and political dogma,” he said. “This gives us the opportunity to do the right thing for the country and in my view that is what we have a duty to do.”The EEA offers most of the benefits of the single market, without being subject to the European court of justice. It does not cover the common agriculture or fisheries policies. Earlier, peers voted to remove the EU exit date of 29 March 2019 from the withdrawal bill, warning that it would be a straitjacket for negotiators. The Duke of Wellington, Charles Wellesley, who moved the amendment, insisted he was not trying to undermine the result of the referendum by delaying or averting Brexit.“We should give ministers a bit more flexibility to secure and obtain ratification of the best possible deal, which will do the least damage to the economy and the national interest,” he said.The government also lost another vote on an amendment seeking to protect UK membership of EU agencies such as Euratom. The Labour leader in the Lords, Angela Smith, said it was an opportunity for the Commons to think again.“The House of Lords amendment is not about stopping Brexit but the fine print of when and how the agreements are concluded,” she said.The defeats came on the final day of debate on the report stage of the bill in the Lords. Peers are due to send it back to the Commons at the end of the week, and the government hopes it will be on the statute book before the end of May. The government has been forced to make concessions, as well as losing a dozen votes during the debates, in a series of amendments that have often had cross-party support.The amendments have been ided between trying to preserve benefits of EU membership, such as workers rights, and other fundamental rights through the incorporation of the EU’s charter of fundamental rights, which has a broader reach than the UK Human Rights Act.Others were intended to promote the place of parliament at the heart of the process of leaving the EU, including clarifying the significance and consequences of the “meaningful vote” on any Brexit deal. And some were more narrowly technical, intended to restrict ministerial powers to change laws without proper parliamentary process and debate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b430d4c5fc27166ec79d576c411a88d72c67b41d/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=45e5c84eae92b7e747857d980c347078 1440w","title":"eamonn magee boxer bullet ira sectarianism world champion","story":"The former world champion boxer’s epic life has been scarred by sectarianism and alcoholism. But he insists he would not change a thing‘I’ve had a beautiful wee life,” Eamonn Magee says soon after he has opened the front door in his dressing gown and cracked open his first beer of the day just after 11 on a Monday morning. The former boxer, who knocked down Ricky Hatton in 2002 and was a world champion when he won the WBU welterweight title, is cut and bruised from being attacked the night before.Magee’s left hand is also swollen with an obviously broken finger making him wince whenever it brushes against his can of Carling. Such pain, however, is fleeting compared with the deeper hurt that runs through him in Ardoyne, the tough Republican enclave of Belfast, where Magee’s life has been scarred by violent sectarianism, tragedy and alcoholism.“I wouldn’t change a thing,” Magee says as he takes another slug of warm beer. His battered, 46‑year‑old face crinkles and the lump under his left eye looks even more like a purple mouse as he echoes: “I’ve still had a wee beautiful life.”Magee is in trouble again because he and the writer Paul Gibson have produced a raw and riveting book which opens like this: “A book? Listen, I’ve been beaten with baseball bats, I’ve had my throat slashed, I’ve been kidnapped and exiled out of the country. I’ve been shot twice, I’ve been in prison and my son’s just been stabbed to death. Amongst all that, I was the welterweight champion of the world while drinking the bar dry and doing enough coke to kill a small horse every night. My life’s not a book. It’s a fucking movie script.”The book has caused strife and he says he has been attacked on successive nights in Ardoyne. Exception has been taken to Magee detailing many horrendous incidents, stretching from Republican politics and sectarian violence to drink and drugs, and he shakes his head when I ask how he is feeling. “It’s more embarrassing when I’m fighting,” he says softly, licking his cracked lips. “Last night I was even talking to him while defending myself. I’m punching him and saying: ‘Fuck sake, what’s this about?’”Magee waves his bust hand at me. “Who do you think came out the better?”Will Magee return to the gym? “I’m busy this week but back next Monday,” he says, defiantly.Could someone really walk in and shoot him? “What’s keeping them?” Magee says with a dark chuckle. “It’s not as if they don’t know where I live.”I had felt calm when I took the call which told me about Magee’s latest scrap. My mood remained the same in the cab rumbling through the familiar streets of Belfast, passing the old Republican murals and the high Peace Walls which still separate Catholic and Protestant communities. I even felt OK when, after I rang the bell, two pit bulls next door leapt at the fence, barking fiercely. “They’re wee nippers,” their owner warned as he pulled the dogs away.Yet it’s hard to feel serene now. Each time Magee’s phone interrupts us, with its Who Let The Dogs Out? ringtone, I scan his beaten-up face, wondering if it’s a call to tell him a paramilitary gunman is on his way. I don’t feel too hopeful at the prospect of Magee, in his dressing gown, and I talking our way out of trouble.“Why the hell would you want to shoot me?” Magee asks. “I didn’t do anything wrong.”As a way of changing the subject I point to his beer. He has been drinking since he was nine and the book makes clear he is a high‑functioning alcoholic but does he ever wish he could kick the bottle?“I tried rehab,” he eventually says, pausing again with comic timing before breaking into the Amy Winehouse song. “And I said, ‘No, no, no!’”I can’t help laughing with him before Magee continues. “I really did go to rehab and the only thing that fucked me up was that you’re not allowed TV. Not having TV was worse than no drink. You’re better off doing six months in jail.”Beneath all his scars the internal wounds have not healed. Magee tells a chilling story of how, during internment raids in the 1970s, he and his three brothers would be turned out of the two beds they shared. British soldiers marched them downstairs and they had to kneel, hands behind their heads, while their photographs were taken for no apparent reason.“Oh fuck, where are we starting?” Magee says as he remembers the impact that internment, detention without trial, had on Catholic families in the Troubles. “My dad was a through‑and‑through Republican and had a proper understanding of what the war was about. It wasn’t about bothering Protestants. The war was against the British army in Ireland. But my dad was a smashing man. The Brits imprisoned him in Long Kesh and the Irish Republicans had a bus run because in them days people couldn’t afford anything else. So we would take the bus up to Long Kesh. I was a wee nuisance and carried in letters which we’d written on cigarette papers. I folded them and hid them under my tongue.”Magee opens his mouth to show me how he did it but, sitting in his dead father’s house, I’m upset by his memory of how, once his dad had fallen out with the IRA and been banished to England, he snuck back into Ardoyne and was hidden away in his attic. Magee, his mum, Isobel, and his brothers lived in fear of his dad being discovered. They hid him in the attic for 18 months – which contributed to Magee Sr’s acute depression and alcoholism.“I didn’t get over that,” Magee says. “My mum would have a wee drink and dad would sit in there all night. I’d go in and slip him a tin or a fag. Nobody ever knew he was there.”Later, when Magee had become one of the most accomplished amateur boxers in Ireland, his father saved his career. Magee had joined the IRA’s youth wing because he loved the mayhem of rioting but he also began taking and dealing drugs. An IRA punishment shooting usually entailed being shot in the kneecap or worse but his dad reminded the paramilitaries that Eamonn was fighting in the Irish championships.“If my dad hadn’t stepped in they were talking about me getting the six-pack – elbows, knees and ankle. But my father convinced them to only give me one bullet.”How did Magee feel waiting for the knock on the door before he took a bullet in his calf? He shrugs. “It had to be dealt with. I knew it was going to be a flesh wound so hurry the fuck up. When he took me down an alleyway I asked: ‘What it’s like getting shot?’ He said: ‘Like a hot poker going in your leg.’”Who Let The Dogs Out? thumps again on cue. Magee shuts down his phone and I say it’s incredible he still won the national title a few months later. “I won but there was blood streaming down my leg from the gunshot wound.”Magee is a hard and sometimes violent man but between the ropes he was a slick southpaw who boxed with artistry. “I never bullied anybody in my life, so you can rephrase that,” he says quietly when I mention his violent infamy. “I went to the gym because I’m the baby of four and my brothers all were boxers. After a couple of years I’d see wee openings. Bing, bang. Soon as I started learning how to hit him before he hits me it was a hell of a lot easier.”Magee’s best year in the ring was in 2002 when he knocked out Jon Thaxton, a very good pro, to secure a crack at Hatton’s WBU light-welterweight title. He still drank six beers every Saturday night while training. “It was a wee prize at the end of the week but I was well prepared for Thaxton. With the Hatton camp, life was a party.”He would drive around town late at night, visiting bars and clubs, with Magee v Hatton logos splashed across his Range Rover. Three senior IRA men paid him a visit. “I don’t know why they gave me another warning. I wasn’t doing anything wrong apart from drinking and driving – and that’s nothing to do with the IRA. They told me to concentrate on training and stop partying. The main guy shook my hand and said: ‘Best of luck when you fight Ricky.’”It clearly worked in the Hatton fight because, in round one, Magee knocked down his celebrated opponent. “It was the worst punch I ever threw because I landed it after 40 seconds. Bam! But he’s 10 years my junior so of course he’s getting up when still so fresh. I wish I’d landed that punch later.”Hatton sealed a close decision but Magee won the vacant WBU welterweight title by beating a journeyman in Jimmy Vincent in December 2003. He retained his world title until May 2006 but he only had two fights in that troubled time. Magee had fallen out with a respected figure in Republican circles and, in a gruesome attack in 2004, his left leg was clubbed to a pulp. He suffered a compound fracture of his tibia and fibia, a shattered knee, and a punctured lung. They called him the Miracle Man when he returned to the ring.Magee’s legs stick out of his dressing gown and the lumps and scars provide graphic proof of that terrible beating. “It still gives me pain,” he says, balancing a beer on his knee as he studies his left leg. “The doctor thought I’d never walk again but I was in the gym a year later.”I suggest we leave the house and go for a walk around Magee’s neighbourhood. Rather than waiting inside for a knock on the door, we will be less exposed to any stray visitors. Magee agrees but, first, we remember his son who was stabbed to death in May 2015 – by the jealous ex-husband of his girlfriend. Eamonn Jr was so different to him, studying engineering at university while also boxing, and the grief becomes too much. Magee starts to cry, a muffled ache falling from his mouth as tears roll down his face.I say how sorry I am and Magee squeezes my hand only to curse the pain in his broken finger, before wiping his eyes. We talk about his book and, of the title, he says: “The Lost Soul was beautiful. My mother called me a lost soul and she was right.”Magee goes upstairs to get dressed. When he returns, wearing a hat straight out of Peaky Blinders, he almost looks dapper. The old fighter sinks the dregs of his beer. We walk outside and Magee takes me on a tour of the murals. Afterwards he hugs me in the street, calling me a gentleman and a scholar, even if I can’t stay for a lunchtime drink. Magee lifts his broken hand in a stately wave as my taxi drives away. I check my recording in the back of the cab and Magee’s ghostly voice echoes again as we drive through Belfast: “I’ve seen things not many people have seen but if they hadn’t happened I wouldn’t be the man I am today. So I wouldn’t change a thing. I’m more than happy with my wee life.”The Lost Soul of Eamonn Magee by Paul Gibson is available at www.bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec2cfb7e007b11dd4bbe80818f2fde3da632bf78/0_98_3488_2094/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a737bf61c99e9dbd710ffc9c8626b07","title":"the hundred ecb pca players approval","story":"• PCA holds meetings with governing body over new competition• Union remains ‘open-minded’ despite lack of clarity over rulesThe Professional Cricketers’ Association has warned that The Hundred will not go ahead without the players on board as concerns over its quirky format, the move away from Twenty20 and the impact on women’s cricket rumble on.Representatives from the players’ union met the England and Wales Cricket Board at Edgbaston on Tuesday to discuss the quickfire 100-ball format. It will start in 2020 and feature two-and-a-half-hour matches played by eight city teams at the height of summer.Daryl Mitchell, the PCA chairman, left the meeting with Tom Harrison, the ECB chief executive, and Sanjay Patel, the tournament’s managing director, assured that, despite some past secrecy, the views of the country’s 420 professional players will be central to its creation.Asked what it would take for the 100-ball format not to go ahead, Mitchell said: “Judging by the information about other stakeholders, probably the players saying they don’t want it. We have the power to do that but whether it does happen or not, I’m not sure.“There is no competition without any players, is there? As a union, we would have to feel very strongly to go completely against it.”Though Mitchell insisted the PCA would remain “open-minded”, he outlined issues regarding a lack of detail over the playing regulations – chiefly the 10-ball over – and disappointment that despite the continuation of the 18-county Blast, the new tournament will not be Twenty20.The ECB told the meeting the move to a 100-ball innings was not down to broadcast demands but market research that, despite not being shared on the day, shows the desired “new audience” want a shorter game that is more family-friendly.The PCA representatives, who included players from all 18 counties, plus Tammy Beaumont and Jonny Bairstow from the England women and men’s teams, told the ECB they do not want the County Championship to be played at the same time as the new tournament. Mitchell said the championship remains “the pinnacle” of the domestic game for the players.The women’s version of The Hundred will, unlike the men’s game, result in the Kia Super League being replaced and thus not mirror the international game. Mitchell said: “There’s no getting away from that, they need to be playing T20 cricket.”An ECB spokesperson said: “Players are the core of the game and we look forward to further discussions as we continue to develop the competition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75f9ca9d670a2733ad8c26b008307edf45b11a29/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90157647d126df42557d45ae53fcc76e","title":"swipe left why dating shows have become irrelevant","story":"The announcement of a new TV show based on a Snapchat dating concept is the latest nail in the coffin of a genre that doesn’t have a place in an online dating-focused worldToday in hellish sentences I never thought I’d write, a Snapchat dating show is coming to television. Phone Swap, which currently gets 10 million viewers on Snapchat Discover, will run on select Fox stations later this year.The premise of Phone Swap is simple. Potential love interests decide whether or not to date each other based on the contents of their phones. Theoretically, it’s a potentially gripping premise. Will she love you if she discovers your Barry Manilow Spotify playlists? Will she love you if she opens your banking app and realises that you’re destitute? Will she love you after reading all the nightmarish murder lists you’ve drawn up in the middle of the night on Notes?However, I suspect two things will stop Phone Swap from becoming a success. First, it’s a dating show about millennials looking at each others’ phones, so it might as well just be called Hey Everyone, Here’s What My Penis Looks Like. And second, it’s yet another gimmicky dating show in a field littered with gimmicky dating shows.The problem with all of these shows is that they’re not really dating shows. Over the years, the joy of watching two people fall in love – whether it’s an instant click of chemistry or a slow-burn surge of affection – has given way to a carnival of humiliation. Dating is just a veneer that these shows use to plumb the depths of human discomfiture. You don’t watch The Bachelorette because you believe in the purity of love you watch it to see a bunch of Donald Jr boneheads present their worst selves to the world. And you’re not going to watch Phone Swap to see the magical moment when two people realise that they need each other in their lives you’re going to watch it for the mortifying moment when a woman realises that a stranger keeps stalking his ex on Facebook.To my mind, the reason why dating shows have fallen into this cul-de-sac of cruelty is because the form has already been perfected. And it was perfected five and a half decades ago. The Dating Game remains the essence of everything all dating shows aspire to be. One dater, a few aspiring datees, a handful of questions and a crusading belief in the power of love, and that was all. In the UK, The Dating Game became Blind Date, in which previous couples would return to the show to dissect everything that had worked and failed during their time together. This, thanks to host Cilla Black’s palpable disappointment whenever a relationship crashed and burned, made it the Abbey Road of dating shows. It couldn’t last forever, because the sheer force of grinding repetition was bound to kill it in the end. But it was pure, and everything since has simply been a slapdash Xerox.But I could be wrong. Perhaps Phone Swap will become the new gold standard of dating show. I’d even be happy if it was. Anything that permanently derails The Bachelorette, I’m all for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d923a1b967a417403fea3166a84a4b4adfdbeac/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3baa62f4a694f58c753f9f72a9dfd80","title":"hawaiis kilauea volcano erupts in pictures","story":"The eruption of Kilauea volcano has sent lava flowing into residential areas on Hawaii’s Big Island, with residents ordered to abandon their homes.

It is the second meeting between the two leaders in about 40 days, and was kept secret until Kim had left China. Shortly after the summit was reported, Trump said on Twitter he would speak to Xi by phone about North Korea, where he said “relationships and trust are building”.Kim and Xi discussed relations between their two countries as well as “major issues of common concern”, and Kim restated Pyongyang’s desire to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.“It has been the DPRK’s consistent and clear stand to achieve denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” Kim said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, according to paraphrased remarks reported by Xinhua. “As long as relevant parties abolish their hostile policies and remove security threats against the DPRK, there is no need for the DPRK to be a nuclear state and denuclearisation can be realised.”It was not immediately clear what security threats Kim was referring to, but experts have said North Korea may push for the removal of some or all of the 28,000 US soldiers currently stationed in South Korea. The meeting comes as Kim prepares to meet Trump, who has said the date and location of the summit is fixed but has yet to make details public.“I hope to build mutual trust with the US through dialogue,” Kim was quoted as saying. He said he hoped to take “phased and synchronous measures” in order to “eventually achieve” a formal peace treaty with Seoul – the two neighbours are still technically in a state of war – and a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.The statement seemed to be at odds with demands from the US, which has called on North Korea to immediately disarm.Although Kim’s meeting was reported in North Korean media, his remarks on denuclearisation were noticeably absent. Kim travelled to Dalian by plane, in a public and telling break with his father’s traditional means of travel – he insisted on only using an armoured train due to a fear of flying. China has been angling to retain its influence over its ally amid the recent rapprochement between North and South Korea, and Kim’s desire to directly engage with the US. Kim and Xi have had a frosty relationship since Kim came to power in 2011, only meeting for the first time in late March. That was Kim’s first official trip outside North Korea when he travelled to Beijing in a bullet-proof train.“China is willing to continue to work with all relevant parties and play an active role in comprehensively advancing the process of peaceful resolution of the peninsula issue through dialogue, and realising long-term peace and stability in the region,” Xi said.The meeting between the two men comes as the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, is set to travel to Tokyo for meetings with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in.Moon hosted Kim during a historic one-day summit in April, marking the first time a leader from North Korea had set foot in the South since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. The two leaders agreed to work towards the goal of “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” in a joint statement that capped the cordial meeting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23fe909f560010ad3ad3044b56162bb9f3ec0796/0_285_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=100ce8f559336c3910b391f48cf8a5e7","title":"obama iran nuclear deal democrats republicans reaction","story":"Barack Obama on Tuesday condemned Donald Trump’s decision to violate the Iran nuclear deal as “misguided” joining a throng of other outspoken Democratic critics - even as many Republicans praised the move. The former president, for whom the landmark 2015 accord was a signature foreign policy accomplishment, issued a lengthy written statement shortly after Trump announced the US would break with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) despite the urging of European allies and some of his own advisers. “In a democracy, there will always be changes in policies and priorities from one Administration to the next. But the consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding America’s credibility, and puts us at odds with the world’s major powers,” Obama said. Since leaving the White House, Obama has responded to only a handful of Trump’s policy decisions, including his travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, decision to pull the US from the Paris climate accord, and move to rescind protections to young, undocumented immigrants.In line with previous comments, Obama did not mention his successor by name. Much of the former president’s statement instead sought to clarify the facts surrounding the Iran deal and its terms, while insisting that the accord was working.“I believe that the decision to put the JCPOA at risk without any Iranian violation of the deal is a serious mistake,” Obama said. “The United States could eventually be left with a losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East.”Obama’s concerns were echoed by John Kerry, the former secretary of state, who led US negotiations of the accord.Kerry said Trump’s decision “breaks America’s word” and expressed hope the deal could continue without America.“Instead of building on unprecedented nonproliferation verification measures, this decision risks throwing them away and dragging the world back to the brink we faced a few years ago,” Kerry said.“America should never have to outsource those stakes to any other country,” he added. “This is not in America’s interests. We should all hope the world can preserve the nuclear agreement.”Political reaction in Washington split along partisan lines, with Republicans rushing to defend the president and Democrats sounding the alarm over the prospect of war.Top Democrats decried Trump’s announcement, including some who had lobbied against the deal.Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, warned Trump was making “a grave mistake”. “With this decision President Trump is risking U.S. national security, recklessly upending foundational partnerships with key U.S. allies in Europe and gambling with Israel’s security,” Menendez, a senator from New Jersey who was a staunch opponent of the accord, said in a statement. “President Trump owns the consequences of today’s decision,” he added.Tim Kaine, a Democrat on the Senate foreign relations and armed services committees, said Trump was “creating a new global nuclear crisis” by violating the deal.“President Trump has set us on a dangerous road where war becomes more likely, especially as his advisers beat the drums for regime change, which should never be a goal of US policy,” said Kaine, who co-authored legislation in 2015 that enabled Congress to review the Iran deal before US sanctions could be lifted. ￼Republicans were quick to support Trump’s decision, in another sign of the party’s reluctance to challenge the president. Although some Republicans had expressed reservations about pulling out of the accord, criticism was muted after the announcement.“I have always believed the best course of action is to fix the deficiencies in the agreement,” House speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. “It is unfortunate that we could not reach an understanding with our European partners on a way to do that.”Ryan, who plans to retire at the end of the year, called the deal “deeply flawed” and praised Trump for sending “a strong statement that we can and must do better”.Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, said Trump was staying true to what he promised as a candidate. “This is something the president campaigned on,” McCarthy told Fox News.The Iran deal, which was struck in 2015 by six world powers and Iran after nearly two years of negotiations and designed to restrict Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, has long been a target of Republicans. The Trump administration has insisted it will pursue a new deal aimed at preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. But Tehran has sounded a defiant tone and warned of “historic regret” if America were to leave the nuclear accord."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4ae5c227006918e4b5237f9a62ebeffae273fdc/0_89_1482_889/master/1482.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70016e5f300a6bcfef70e2f177e76d60","title":"syria says downs two israeli missiles near damascus","story":"Reports of explosions shortly after Trump announces US plans to break with Iran nuclear dealSyrian air defences downed two Israeli missiles near Damascus, state media reported, after explosions were heard at a military base south of the capital.The report arrived soon after US president Donald Trump’s announcement that he would break with the Iran nuclear agreement, a move that has put the region on edge.Israel has warned of open war with Iran, saying it will not allow Tehran to establish a permanent military presence in Syria. Iranian forces have supported the Syrian government in a devastating civil war against insurgents.Syria’s state news agency, SANA, citing a military source on Tuesday, said: “Syrian air defences fired at two Israeli missiles and destroyed them in Kisweh,” an area known to be the location of an army base.The SANA report did not say how many missiles were fired or if others had hit targets in Syria.The news agency posted a video and a photo of flames rising in the night, which it said was caused by the downed missiles.Reuters news agency cited a commander loyal to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad as saying the Israeli strike caused no casualties. Israel did not immediately comment on the reported attack.The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said earlier on Tuesday that it had identified “irregular activity of Iranian forces in Syria” and had decided to unlock and ready bomb shelters in the north, where it shares a frontier with Syria.“Additionally, defence systems have been deployed and IDF troops are on high alert for an attack,” it said. “The IDF is prepared for various scenarios and warns that any aggression against Israel will be met with a severe response.”Israeli media reported that reservists had been recalled. In February, Israel said it had downed an armed Iranian drone it said had penetrated its airspace. Since then, Israel’s air force is believed to have struck Iranian targets operating in Syria several times, including a 9 April strike on Syria’s largest airbase, killing seven Iranians.Tehran, Israel’s archenemy, has vowed to retaliate.Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet on Sunday that Iran has delivered advanced weapons to Syria “in order to attack us both on the battlefield and on the home front”.“We are determined to block Iran’s aggression against us even if this means a struggle. Better now than later,” he said. “We do not want escalation, but we are prepared for any scenario.”On Tuesday, Netanyahu expressed strong support for Trump’s announcement about the Iran nuclear agreement, saying it was a “bold decision today to reject the disastrous nuclear deal with the terrorist regime in Tehran”.

Photograph: The The Government is planning to remove the “Baptism barrier” for entry to Catholic primary schools from September of next year.Under changes to be announced on Wednesday, all Catholic primary schools will be prohibited from giving enrolment priority to baptised children in cases where they are over-subscribed.The vast majority of primary schools – just over 90 per cent – are of a Catholic ethos.However, minority faiths, such as the Church of Ireland, will be allowed to prioritise members of their religion in order to protect their ethos in cases where they are over-subscribed.This exclusion has been introduced to help ensure children of minority faiths can still access a school of their own religion.The new rules will apply to over-subscribed schools (about 20 per cent) only. Schools that are not oversubscribed will be obliged to accept all applicants, regardless of religion.Minister for Education Richard Bruton said the “historic” move aimed to balance the rights of non-denominational, Catholic and minority faith families.“It is unfair that a local child of no religion is passed over in favour of a child of religion, living some distance away, for access to their local school,” Mr Bruton said. “Parents should not feel pressured to baptise their child to get access to their local school.”Mr Bruton said he planned to enacted the School Admissions Bill as quickly as possible, so it would apply to children entering school in the 20192020 school year.While Mr Bruton announced the plans last year, the planned amendment has been subject to extensive legal advice from the Attorney General’s office.The  reported earlier this year that Catholic bishops and trustee bodies for thousands of Catholic schools, along with management bodies and missionary groups, were preparing to fight the changes through legal challenges. They have argued that the planned changes are unfair and mean that some Catholic children may now be denied places in their local Catholic school.Government sources, however, say they are satisfied the planned changes are “legally robust”.Mr Bruton has argued that Catholic children will still be able to access Catholic primary schools given that the majority – 90 per cent – provide for religious instruction or education through the faith.Other significant changes to the legislation, which seeks to provide a fairer admissions policy, include:* A provision to allow all-Irish primary and secondary schools to give enrolment priority to Irish-speaking children. Under this approach, parents will be required to provide evidence that their child has an “age appropriate” level of fluency. Parents will have a choice to demonstrate this through an interview at the school or via a video.* New powers for the Minister for Education to require schools to open special classes for children with special needs where it is deemed necessary. At present, there are no powers to compel schools to establish special classes. However, research suggests some schools erect “soft barriers” to discourage children with additional needs from applying.Mr Bruton said the changes were aimed at introducing a more “parent-friendly, equitable and consistent” approach to how school admissions policies operate for the 4,000 State-recognised schools across the country."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3487107.1525724056!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"removal of baptism barrier may prompt legal action","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Richard Bruton is due to bring an Amendment to school admissions legislation to Cabinet on Tuesday.

However, minority faiths, such as the Church of Ireland, would be allowed to prioritise members of their religion in order to protect their ethos in cases where they are over-subscribed.While Mr Bruton announced the plans last year, the planned amendment has been subject to extensive legal advice from the Attorney General’s office.The  reported earlier this year that Catholic bishops, trustee bodies for thousands of Catholic schools, along with management bodies and missionary groups, were preparing to fight the changes.The Association of Trustees of Catholic Schools has warned the plans appear to be part of a process of “encroachment on parental rights, property rights and the capacity of faith schools to provide a faith-based education for those who opt for same”.The Catholic Schools Partnership, which represents the Catholic bishops in the education sector, argued forcing schools to change their admissions policies without increasing the number of places would result only in “different families and their children being disappointed”.The Department of Education has declined to comment on the wording of the amendments.However, Mr Bruton has been on record as stating that it is “unfair that preference is given by publicly funded religious schools to children of their own religion who might live some distance away, ahead of children of a different religion or of no religion who live close to the school”.Given the backlog of legislation before the Oireachtas, political sources say it is unlikely the school admissions legislation will be enacted ahead of the summer recess.Once enacted, it is likely that Catholic primary schools will be given a lead-in time to change their admission policies.The legislation also contains wide-ranging changes aimed at making admissions to school fairer. – A phasing out of waiting lists for the enrolment of children within a five-year period. Instead, parents will be required enrol their child in schools during a three-week window in the year prior to enrolment:– A 25 per cent limit on the number of places that schools can set aside for children of past pupils at present there is no limit– A requirement that all schools publish details of their arrangements for children who opt out of religious instruction classes, and– New powers to ensure a child with special needs can access a school place that is designated by the National Council for Special Education. Attempts by the previous government to put in place similar changes were never legislated for and faced resistance from some private schools. Many private secondary schools, for example, have the names of young children on waiting lists for admission for a decade or more.Past pupils organisations linked to both Blackrock College and Belvedere College, two fee-paying schools for boys in Dublin, have lobbied against some of the changes, in particular the “old school tie” provision which limits the number of places set aside for children of past pupils."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3487962.1525812169!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"drinking along grand canal cannot continue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPart of the Grand Canal in Portabello, Dublin. Photograph: Caitriona O’KennedyLarge numbers of people gathering to drink alcohol along the Grand Canal in Dublin during periods of good weather is something a local city councillor says “we cannot allow to continue”. Hundreds of people congregated around Charlemont Bridge and Portobello Harbour over the Bank Holiday weekend as temperatures rose to 23 degrees, the highest recorded so far this year. Cllr Mary Freehill (Labour), who lives along the Grand Canal, said she was contacted by a number of locals regarding people littering and urinating in the vicinity. She said responding to the crowds required a more co-ordinated effort from gardaí and to recognise it is an issue that “has to be dealt with”. “There has been drugs there as well, I’m afraid. What really concerns me about this is when you have a group of people consuming a lot of alcohol around very deep water. People may not realise that is an accident waiting to happen. It’s something we cannot allow to continue.” Ms Freehill said she would be raising the issue at Dublin City Council’s South East area committee next week. Cllr Chris Andrews (Sinn Féin) said “whenever the sun shines it’s a problem” dealing with groups gathering along the canal. “There’s no overnight solution. We’re going to have to put a strategy in place to address it and redevelop it so there is infrastructure there for people who are social drinking and enjoying the scenery,” he said. “The gardaí, Dublin City Council, Waterways Ireland, people themselves have to be more aware and more proactive. The area looks like it has a hangover this morning, like a lot of the people who were drinking there.”Mr Andrews said some of the possibilities being considered included temporary portaloos, though this remains an “unpopular” option. “Dublin City Council street cleaning team hose down the entire area the following morning. They put out extra bins which aren’t aesthetically pleasing but they’re functional. Even then, people throw (rubbish) into the canal when they get drunk. It is very difficult to address,” he said. Meanwhile, a Green Party councillor in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown has advised families planning to visit the area’s beaches during warm weatherto go early in the day before people get rowdy after drinking alcohol.Ossian Smyth issued the warning after gardaí used pepper spray to subdue members of a group drinking near the 40-Foot bathing spot on Sunday after an altercation.The council has imposed a ban on the consumption of alcohol in public in the vicinity of the 40-Foot.Mr Smyth said he knew someone who witnessed the incident, a daily swimmer and beach-cleaner, who was disturbed by what they had seen. He said “the earlier in the day that people go to the beach, the less chance of encountering anti-social behaviour like this.”A Garda spokesman said officers attended a number of public order incidents at Sandycove on Sunday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3488369.1525804272!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"south dubliners brand apartment plans a monstrosity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGeorgian-style apartments planned for Kilternan.Residents in south Dublin have objected to plans for a six-storey Georgian-style apartment scheme at the foot of the Dublin mountains in Kilternan on the grounds it would be “totally unsuitable” for the local rural area.Developer Greg Kavanagh’s Calerotech Ltd has sought planning permission from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for the complex of 97 apartments at the Golden Ball pub. If granted permission it would be the first apartment scheme in Kilternan.The design of the complex “seeks to delve into a portion of the nation’s richest historical architectural heritage” the application states, and is based on the Custom House and the “Georgian Squares of Dublin” according to the developers. It also represents a “back to basics” approach in terms of design, Calerotech said.Local resident Anne-Marie Leen described the scheme as a “monstrosity of a development” which is “totally unsuitable to the areas and is only at best suitable for a city centre location, and probably not suitable in Ireland at all”. The apartments would not be in keeping with the “countrysidevillage feel” of Kilternan, she said.Another local, Ciarán Moulton, said the scheme would “adversely effect the views to the Dublin mountains enjoyed by local residents”, would worsen local traffic, and affect visibility on the main road.The Balally Residents Association said the height and scale of the development was “more aligned to a city – not a rural suburb”. It would increase the already “massive traffic delays” and the pressure on the Luas Green line, it said.Several residents emphasised the low-rise nature of the area, which is dominated by bungalows and two-storey houses, and said the additional traffic would damage air quality and affect the health of existing residents.In relation to the scale, Calerotech said when Dublin’s Georgian squares were first planned they were considered “too urban” for their locations, and that 60 years ago “ Cabra, Crumlin, Ballymun etc” were mostly green fields.Local Fine Gael Cllr John Kennedy made a submission in favour of the scheme which he said appeared a more “family friendly” size than most apartment schemes in Dublin“The ornate design of the exterior is of a significantly higher standard than typical apartment scheme designs and would be reminiscent of well-regarded architecture seen in London and Paris,” he said.“I think it would be unlikely that a better designed scheme would ultimately materialise in future on these lands.”Mr Kavanagh, the self-described “Ronaldo of the property market” 18 months ago left New Generation Homes, the high profile development company he founded with Pat Crean. New Generation made headlines from 2011 onwards when it spent up to €300 million buying up development land at the bottom of the market. Submissions on the Kilternan plan can be made to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council until Thursday.Selected by picture editor Frank Miller"},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3488464.1525809888!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"facebook s ban on ads reflect nerves of repeal supporters","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFacebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. The move by the company  to no longer accept foreign advertisements relating to  Eighth Amendment referendum will come as welcome news to some on the Yes side of the campaign. File photograph: Stephen LamReuters. The move by Facebook to no longer accept foreign advertisements relating to the upcoming referendum on the Eighth Amendment will come as welcome news to some on the Yes side of the campaign. There has been rising concern among some pro-repeal groups and supporters that the referendum could be swayed in its decisive weeks towards a No vote by an avalanche of online ads.Facebook’s move is likely to be directly related to this fear: and a fear that if the referendum were defeated, the company would face questions about its role in influencing votes, as it has in the US and UK. In the past fortnight, there has been a rising sense of pessimism in some repeal quarters that the campaign was slipping away from them. Yesterday, the transparency campaigner Gavin Sheridan tweeted that it was now his view that the No side would win the campaign because its online spending was dwarfing that of the Yes campaign. Sheridan was giving voice to the private views that have become increasingly common among some influential repeal campaigners. (Needless to say he was monstered online by some repeal supporters for being insufficiently supportive). The repeal side, he said, “is not at the races”.No campaigners have mustered a powerful online campaign, with observers (many of them repeal supporters, it should be said) reporting a surge in ads in the last week or so. Privately, some senior figures in the No campaign doubt if religiously-inspired anti-abortion online ads are helping them win the soft repeal voters whose minds they need to change if they are to win.However, despite the fears of the repealers (and the hopes of the retainers) if there is a big change going on in the campaign, the polls have not yet picked it up. A Sunday Independent poll at the weekend showed a strong – albeit diminished – lead for the Yes side. It was consistent with all the polls published in recent months.It is possible – if most unlikely – that all the polls, every one of them, have been wrong that there is a big No vote out there and people are lying to pollsters about. It’s more likely, however, that a big move hasn’t occurred in the campaign. There has been some weakening of the Yes vote, but not a sufficient strengthening of the No vote to fundamentally change the picture that emerged at the start of the campaign. That’s not to say that such a change couldn’t happen in the last fortnight but there’s no evidence that it has happened yet. By and large, the offline public-political discourse has been managed in terms of reasonable civility, with both sides – mostly – acknowledging their opponents’ right to differ. The posters of aborted foetuses, which many people find deeply distressing, are an exception. But by-and-large the debates have not been offensive, abusive or hate-filled. The canvass reports from both sides stress respectful engagement on the doors. The online campaign has been different – vicious, personalised and offensive. And with a campaign that is tightening as polling day approaches, the online element will be more important than ever before.There are enough people on either side who believe that the online campaign can be decisive to make it a key battleground in the remaining fortnight. Facebook’s move will do little to alter that.

Photograph:  Niall CarsonPA WireThe Government is ided over the future of the director general of the Health Service Executive, Tony O’Brien. Three Cabinet Ministers – Katherine Zappone, Finian McGrath and Michael Ring – called for Mr O’Brien to stand aside from his role at Tuesday’s meeting. It is understood Mr Ring said officials in the HSE needed to be held accountable for the errors that have unfolded over recent days, while Ms Zappone told the meeting she believed it was appropriate on balance for Mr O’Brien to stand aside.The Independent Alliance also had a pre-Cabinet meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar seeking clarity on the position of Mr O’Brien. It is understood the Taoiseach advised the political grouping Mr O’Brien’s contract allowed for three months’ notice and said the director general could take a case of constructive dismissal if forced out of his role.Speaking publicly, Minister for Health Simon Harris declined to express confidence in Mr O’Brien and expressed his fury at the misinformation given to the Government in recent weeks on this controversy.These comments are understood to have caused anger within the HSE.Asked if he supported Mr O’Brien remaining in office, Mr Harris told reporters: “I’ve made my position very clear in relation to Tony O’Brien. He has eight or so weeks left to serve in his post.“I expect him to do everything he can to assist in that time. I’ve been consistent in my view.”The Minister was speaking as the Government confirmed the terms of reference for a scoping inquiry into the delayed diagnosis of cervical cancer to a number of women.The review will examine the widespread non-disclosure to patients relating to the CervicalCheck audits, how facts were shared, escalated, reported and communicated through the organisation, the HSE and the Department of Health. It will assess why the policy of open disclosure was not implemented by CervicalCheck, look at the decision to outsource the laboratory results and assess if there are issues regarding other screening services including BreastCheck and bowel screening.The chair of the inquiry, Dr Gabriel Scally, said his inquiry would be completely independent of Government and the Department of Health, insisting he would be comprehensive and frank in his deliberations.Where he finds failures, Dr Scally insists he will make those known to the public but confirmed he may not be in a position to attribute blame to iniduals.“It may not be possible for me to attribute blame and to iniduals. That is outside my remit. If I find serious problems, I will certainly be pointing to those serious problems,” he told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday.Dr Scally will submit an interim report to Mr Harris at the beginning of June and will have his work completed by the end of the month.The 63 year old was born in Belfast and is currently based in Bristol. He is the president of the epidemiology and public health section of the Royal Society of Medicine. He previously served on the Eastern Health and Social Services Board in Northern Ireland and as regional director of public health in England. During his tenure in the NHS and the Department of Health, he dealt with several high-profile clinical service failures including breast screening in Exeter and pathology in Swindon, and led the NHS review of the commissioning of care and treatment for patients at Winterbourne View where patients were seriously abused. In 2012, Dr Scally resigned from England’s department of health due to his opposition to the then coalition government’s health policies.Meanwhile, Mr O’Brien last night told TDs he would attend a meeting of the Oireachtas health committee today.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3488472.1525810219!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu determined to preserve iran nuclear deal after us pulls out","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            An Iranian woman walks past a mural on the wall of the former US embassy in the Iranian capital Tehran on Tuesday.

Photograph: EPA “The deal with Iran is the culmination of 12 years of diplomacy,” EU high representative for foreign affairs Federica Mogherini said on Tuesday night in response to the US decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.“ It belongs to the entire international community . . . The EU is determined to preserve it.”Ms Mogherini, who was a facilitator of the Iran agreement and chairs the joint committee that oversees it, echoed sentiments from many of the EU’s capitals in expressing a determination to keep the deal still working, and sent a strong signal that the union would not adhere to sanctions proposed by president Donald Trump.The EU is determined to persuade Iran that the agreement can survive US repudiation.The five powers that brokered the deal – China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom – along with the EU all said they regretted the decision on Tuesday night, reiterating their commitment to the deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).In a joint statement on Tuesday evening, British prime minister Theresa May, France’s president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel emphasised their continuing commitment to deal, saying it remained important for our shared security.“This resolution remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear programme. We urge all sides to remain committed to its full implementation and to act in a spirit of responsibility.”Mr Macron also tweeted to warn that the US withdrawal was putting the international nuclear non-proliferation regime at stake.EU leaders will have been particularly alarmed by Mr Trump saying “any nation that helps Iran could also face sanctions”, a clear suggestion that EU companies may face difficulties if they continue doing business there.The ultimatum, a demand that allies fall into line, could cause a considerable rift between the US and EU.Earlier, a spokeswoman for the European Commission insisted the EU will continue to implement the agreement.She reiterated that the Institute of International \u0026amp European Affairs (IIEA) had carried out 10 inspections and had found no significant violations by the Iranians.“It’s quite clear that we believe that the agreement is working and our commitment to continue with implementation remains,” the spokeswoman, Maja Kocijancic, said, adding: “We believe that the agreement should be preserved.”The EU, she said, was “working on plans to protect European companies” that might face US sanctions for continuing to trade with Iran.In increasingly desperate attempts to dissuade Mr Trump from abandoning the JCPOA, EU leaders, most recently Mr Macron and Dr Merkel, have flown to Washington to argue with the president that far from going soft on Iran, they are determined to take it to task over its ballistic missile programme and its military activities in Syria and Yemen.That can best be done, they argued, by maintaining the JCPOA.On Tuesday in Brussels, officials from the EU, France, Germany and UK met a delegation of Iranian officials led by the deputy foreign minister for political affairs, Abbas Araghchi.There have been reports that Iran may be willing to maintain the deal as long as the EU, Russia and China are prepared to defy the US by continuing to trade with Tehran.Russia and China issued a joint statement on Friday declaring their “unwavering support for the comprehensive and effective implementation” of the deal and citing “the urgent necessity for all parties to the JCPOA to rigorously adhere to and fully implement their commitments”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3488035.1525789254!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british voters want things to change but largely stay the same","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May speaks to party supporters at Sedgley Conservative Club in Dudley last week ahead of local elections. Photograph: Anthony Devlin via ReutersFor anyone who grew up in the Age of Landslides that was fin de millénaire Britain, the spectacle of a close election has a freakish novelty. Yet this is the way of things now.Thirteen years, three general elections and a financial crash have passed since the public gave a prime minister a handsome majority in the House of Commons. Two of those elections returned no majority at all. To judge by last week’s votes in English local authorities, neither the Conservatives nor the Labour Party can count on forming a powerful government in the near future.While “ stalemate “ has emerged as the journalistic shorthand for this new dispensation, it is not quite right. Someone has to govern, and the Tories tend to scrape enough votes to do it. Stalemate also implies something of a passive electorate: two parties locked in mutual nullification like chess grandmasters while voters ooh and aah from the auditorium.More likely, what we are living through is not stalemate but weak government by popular design. The British public has improvised through its votes what the American founders hard-wired into their republic’s constitutional architecture: the extreme difficulty of doing all that much in office. One election result could be an accident. It is the consistency of the pattern over the past decade that is so telling. The mood of voters amounts to a kind of constructive indecision. The mystery is what to read into it.Over recent years the idea that Britain wants dramatic change – of a populist, eat-the-rich flavour – has hardened from a plausible theory into a given. As a result, it increasingly goes unscrutinised. If the vote for Brexit proved a wider national readiness for change, you would expect it to tally with electoral results before and since. To an extent that cannot be down to random error, it does not.For a country that demands rupture with a “failed” liberalism, Britain keeps returning parliaments that guarantee – at most – cautious, tinkering amendments to the status quo. Even the referendum was followed, a year later, by a general election that has more or less nixed the hardest version of Brexit as a legislative goer.As she tries to sell the idea of a “customs partnership” with the EU to more strident ministers, Theresa May’s most persuasive argument has nothing to do with the internal merits of her plan. Instead, the prime minister points her colleagues to the arithmetical realities of parliament. If denied a compromise, it might vote for full customs union membership.Excitable Leavers will have this down as sabotage of the people’s will. But the people had a wonderful chance to express themselves a year ago. They could have signed off on a Tory win that made a formality of hard exit. Instead, they returned MPs to take the edge off their own decision to Leave.If they regard this as betrayal, they show no signs of correcting it with a big majority for the Tories (or anyone else) any time soon. Their voting behaviour exposes a tentativeness about change that showed up as long ago as the 2010 general election, when the Tories’ tough fiscal plan spooked a nation that had seemed theirs for the taking.In short, the post-crash British are indeed ravenous for change – until they are forced to define it. As much as they want “something different”, they are not sold on any one version of it. The question is whether distaste for the options on offer eventually becomes grudging forbearance of the status quo.If weak government is the new default, it will not just moderate the terms of EU exit, but public policy beyond. On present form, no government will have the electoral numbers for either laissez-faire or a reassertion of the state in the private economy. Britain will have regained a substantial amount of sovereignty and chosen to do precious little with it. If so, the referendum may come to look less like proof of a coherent national revolt than an uncharacteristic gamble that voters almost immediately hedged against with their electoral choices.The elite’s failure to see Brexit coming has led to an over-correction. A view of the public has set in as nihilists bent on throwing the accumulated wisdoms of the past few decades up in the air and seeing where they land. But people, swing voters especially, still have jobs, mortgages and other tangibles to weigh against the abstract promise of change. Human risk-aversion was not enough to save Britain’s EU membership in 2016, but nor did it disappear. It is unclear what voters want these days, other than their rulers on the shortest of leashes. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3488532.1525814263!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us withdrawal from iran deal branded a serious mistake","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS President Donald Trump signs a proclamation declaring his intention to withdraw from the JCPOA Iran nuclear agreement  at the White House on Tuesday. Photograph: Jonathan ErnstReuters US president Donald Trump defied international allies and announced America’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement on Tuesday, unravelling years of international diplomacy and plunging the wider Middle East region into uncertainty.Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump announced that America would withdraw from the agreement, denouncing the nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama and six other countries as “defective at its core”.While allies had hoped that Mr Trump might embrace some form of incremental withdrawal, he instead announced that America would begin reinstating sanctions that were waived under the 2015 deal and impose new economic sanctions on Iran.The US treasury department was on Tuesday night due to announce a “wind-down” period for companies affected by the current sanctions, ranging from 90 days to six months. But the impact of the US withdrawal was expected to be immediately felt on the global trading system as companies and oil markets absorb the news.“The fact is this was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never ever been made. It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will,” Mr Trump said as he announced the US withdrawal from the agreement, which aimed to restrict Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for the easing of sanctions on the Iranian economy.In a televised address following the announcement, Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani said he had directed his officials to continue to negotiate with Russia, China and the European signatories of the deal about remaining in the agreement.But he warned that Iran would “start enriching uranium more than before” and within a few weeks if the negotiations do not yield concrete results.The leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom issued a joint statement expressing their “regret and concern” over the decision.Noting that the JCPOA was unanimously endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, they said the resolution “remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear programme”.Speaking in Brussels, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the EU was “determined to preserve” the agreement. “The nuclear deal is not a bilateral agreement,” she said. “And it’s not in the hands of any single country to terminate it unilaterally.”In a show of solidarity, European officials met with Iran’s deputy foreign minister for political affairs in Brussels in the hours before the announcement from Washington.In a rare public comment on a policy of his successor, former president Barack Obama issued a statement describing the decision as a “serious mistake”.“The JPCOA is working – that is a view shared by European allies, independent experts and the current US secretary of defence. The JCPOA is in America’s interests – it has significantly rolled back Iran’s nuclear programme.”Noting that it was a model for “what diplomacy can accomplish”, Mr Obama said that the agreement’s inspections and verification regime were “precisely what the United States should be working to put in place in North Korea”.As Mr Trump announced the US withdrawal from the agreement, he revealed that secretary of state Mike Pompeo was on his way to North Korea ahead of a planned summit between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un.It is expected that Mr Pompeo may return with three American detainees who are being held in North Korea. Mr Trump’s legal counsel Rudy Giuliani said last Thursday on Fox News that the detainees would be released by the end of the day, but they have yet to be released."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/08/TELEMMGLPICT000162658475_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqGm4mM_3rfEPy9-FV1MpFOKy7jFMx5ZkRrK5762faYqM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"family five year old boy struck cricket ball local school demand","story":"Five-year-old Harry Butt was struck in the face by a cricket ball from a nearby schoolLearning that your child has been injured whilst playing sport at school can often be a moment of dread and panic for many parents.But for one mother it was a complete shock seeing her son get hit in the face with a cricket ball, especially as he wasn’t even taking part. Five-year-old Harry Butt was stood on a driveway saying farewell to his loved ones before going on holiday when a cricket ball from the nearby school playing fields sailed over the fence and hit him in the face. Michelle Butt had taken her son and her 12-year-old twin daughters to visit friends before heading off on a holiday camping trip to Weymouth.They were on the driveway of the house in Dorset when the ball from Poole Grammar School whistled past Mrs Butt’s ear and struck Harry.Harry Butt was left with severe concussion, two black eyes and a swollen noseNow the five-year-old’s family are demanding safety improvements at the school claiming “the next victim might not be so lucky.”With the support of local residents Mrs Butt is demanding something is done before someone else is seriously injured.The 41-year-old claimed residents on Haslar Road have been complaining for years about cricket balls coming over the fence and hitting their cars, conservatories and ending up on their roofs.She said action should have been taken before a child was nearly killed.I just feel really upset that they\u0027ve been told about the balls going over and nothing has been done,” she said.I know that you can have netting around the pitches. It\u0027s also about the safety of the students at the school - obviously it\u0027s not big enough to play a game of cricket, because the balls keep coming over the fence.The ball reportedly flew through a fence of conifer trees at the school boundaryI just think the way it\u0027s been dealt with is not professional and it should have been done before.The accident left Harry with severe concussion, a swollen nose and a black eye.His family say he\u0027s been suffering from hearing and eyesight problems since the ball hit him after flying over the fence into Haslar Road.Mrs Butt added: It sounded like a bomb had gone off - my little boy was on the floor.We were all in shock and he was dazed. We took him to A\u0026ampE and we were admitted to hospital.He was violently sick, had really bad concussion and the consultant said if it had hit him anywhere else, he wouldn\u0027t be here.It hit him on the forehead, on the side.Andy Baker, the headteacher of Poole Grammar School, said the school regretted the incident.The school plans to move matches with senior pupils to an alternative locationHe told MailOnline: “It was a very unfortunate, one-off accident. We very much regret the injury to the little lad and the stress caused to his family.”He said the suggestion of safety netting being installed above the boundary fence had been looked into before but the school had been advised that the local authority wouldn\u0027t grant planning permission. He added: “I am also not sure how safe it would be with the wind we get here.“What we are going to do for senior matches where the boys and that much bigger and stronger, we will use another pitch that is further from the boundary. We can\u0027t risk this happening again.”Councillor Ray Tindle, who represents Canford Heath West, said he and fellow ward councillor, Sean Gabriel, would be looking to work with both local residents and the school to find a solution and prevent such an incident taking place again.He added: The school has got to face up to the fact that this is an issue and something has to be done.Britain ‘should learn from Japan’ when it comes to care of the elderlyHate preachers who use social media face tougher sentencesMeghan Markle: \u0026#39I can\u0026#39t wait to be a mother\u0026#39Being able to see the same GP is harder than ever, despite ministers’ pledgesIt\u0026#39s quicker to get cocaine delivered to your door than a takeaway pizza, report findsDonald Trump announces \u0026#39withdrawal\u0026#39 from Iran nuclear dealPrince Charles and Duchess of Cornwall attend WWII memorial serviceUK, France and Germany pledge to remain in Iran nuclear deal as US withdraws\u0026#39Shocking sham\u0026#39 sees junk food ads targeted at children on Facebook Scottish S4 exam passes fall by nearly 150,000 since new curriculum in 2014Syria accuses Israel of attacking army base near DamascusDad\u0026#39s Army enthusiasts accosted by armed police Mike Pompeo en route to North Korea ahead of US summit with Kim Jong-UnComment: Donald Trump\u0026#39s trashing of the Iran nuclear deal is really about one word: ObamaRail fares shake-up could see ticket prices increase, admits train industry Headmistress produces exam stress guide to calm the nerves of parentsComment: A parents\u0026#39 guide to surviving your child\u0026#39s exam seasonPopular cereals contain sheep\u0026#39s wool grease and are unsuitable for vegans Cecil Parkinson\u0026#39s disabled daughter wins first round of legal battle against Tory peer\u0026#39s estateDebbie Abrahams sacked from Labour\u0026#39s shadow cabinet after \u0026#39bullying\u0026#39 probeHarry and Meghan\u0026#39s Royal Wedding music will have \u0026#39American slant\u0026#39, conductor saysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"iran has blame end nuclear deal","story":"Since Obama signed the agreement, Iran has become a global menace Arguably the most telling remark that has been made during the current crisis over Iran’s nuclear ambitions is this week’s claim by the country’s president, Hassan Rouhani, that Tehran desires a constructive relationship with the rest of the world.

This can take as little as 20 minutes or as long as two to three days. It is understood that supermarkets have now put plans to introduce the charge on ice following consumer outrage and confusion. Tesco, Sainsbury\u0027s and Morrisons have not yet implemented the £99 charge but are reviewing the situation and plan to introduce it in the near future. It is already over nine months since Visa and Mastercard changed the rules last year.Previously rules stated a pre-authorization charge of £1 should be taken at petrol pumps. A spokesman at Mastercard said: Last year a change in industry rules meant that petrol stations with automated fuel pumps were required to pre-authorise a value equivalent to a full tank of fuel, so that customers didn’t fill up with more fuel than they could afford.  This is designed to protect them, and the petrol station. If customers don’t have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed. While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app -these funds are not taken from their account. Only the value of the petrol dispensed is withdrawn. A Visa spokesman said: “Visa has been working closely with card issuing banks to ensure that consumers do not experience delays in the adjustment of the initially-held amount, however if consumers notice that initial amounts held against their accounts are not adjusted immediately, they should raise this with their card issuing bank in the first instance.”An Asda spokesman said: “Visa and MasterCard have increased the minimum pre-authorisation amount at pay at the pump petrol pumps for all retailers.”Britain ‘should learn from Japan’ when it comes to care of the elderlyHate preachers who use social media face tougher sentencesMeghan Markle: \u0026#39I can\u0026#39t wait to be a mother\u0026#39Being able to see the same GP is harder than ever, despite ministers’ pledgesIt\u0026#39s quicker to get cocaine delivered to your door than a takeaway pizza, report findsDonald Trump announces \u0026#39withdrawal\u0026#39 from Iran nuclear dealPrince Charles and Duchess of Cornwall attend WWII memorial serviceUK, France and Germany pledge to remain in Iran nuclear deal as US withdraws\u0026#39Shocking sham\u0026#39 sees junk food ads targeted at children on Facebook Scottish S4 exam passes fall by nearly 150,000 since new curriculum in 2014Syria accuses Israel of attacking army base near DamascusDad\u0026#39s Army enthusiasts accosted by armed police Mike Pompeo en route to North Korea ahead of US summit with Kim Jong-UnComment: Donald Trump\u0026#39s trashing of the Iran nuclear deal is really about one word: ObamaRail fares shake-up could see ticket prices increase, admits train industry Headmistress produces exam stress guide to calm the nerves of parentsComment: A parents\u0026#39 guide to surviving your child\u0026#39s exam seasonPopular cereals contain sheep\u0026#39s wool grease and are unsuitable for vegans Cecil Parkinson\u0026#39s disabled daughter wins first round of legal battle against Tory peer\u0026#39s estateDebbie Abrahams sacked from Labour\u0026#39s shadow cabinet after \u0026#39bullying\u0026#39 probeHarry and Meghan\u0026#39s Royal Wedding music will have \u0026#39American slant\u0026#39, conductor saysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"popular cereals contain sheeps wool grease unsuitable vegans","story":"Many cereals are fortified with vitamin D to improve their nutritional value, as it helps keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy Popular breakfast cereals including Rice Krispies, Kellogg\u0027s cornflakes and Cheerios contain vitamin D which is made from sheep\u0027s wool grease, it has emerged, meaning they are unsuitable for vegans.It is feared that many of the UK\u0027s 550,000 vegans may have been eating vitamin D fortified cereals, as they contain no ingredients which are obviously derived from animals.They are marked with a suitable for vegetarians logo, with no explicit warning that they are unsuitable for vegans.Confusingly, other cereals which are suitable for vegans such as Nestle\u0027s Shredded Wheat, also carry a Vegetarian logo and not a Vegan logo.Consumers may be surprised to find that vitamin D fortified cereal is made from sheep\u0026#39s wool greaseMany cereals are fortified with vitamin D to improve their nutritional value, as it helps keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy.According to the Department of Health around a quarter of people in the UK have low levels of Vitamin D. To establish whether cereals are vegan friendly, in many cases consumers would need to check online or call customer services. In response to the finding, the Vegan Society has called for clearer labeling of cereals containing vitamin D3, which is made from oils from sheep\u0027s wool.A spokesman at the Vegan Society said: “Many cereals are fortified with either vitamin D3 from animal fat or vitamin D2, which is an animal-free option. Unfortunately, without contacting the manufacturer, consumers may not know which has been used.Kellogg\u0026#39s new brand, WK KelloggThis presents issues for vegans, who make every effort to avoid animal products. We urge manufacturers to opt for vegan sources of vitamin D, and to label the ingredient clearly.  Consumers can also look out for products carrying the Vegan Trademark that indicate that the product meets The Vegan Society’s standards.  It comes as Kellogg\u0027s has launched a new range of vegan cereals under a new brand called W.K. Kellogg, marking a significant departure from its traditional red font logo. Its new range of healthy, low sugar and vegan granolas retail are designed to compete with upmarket cereal brands like Dorset Cereals and Lizi\u0027s Granola. They retail at around £3.75 per box, around twice the price of its regular cereals. A Kellogg’s spokesman, said: “Kellogg’s provides a choice of cereals, including the WK Kellogg range which is suitable for vegans. This is labelled on packs.“Our cereals that contain Vitamin D are clearly labelled and follow the EU and UK labelling laws.”Britain ‘should learn from Japan’ when it comes to care of the elderlyHate preachers who use social media face tougher sentencesMeghan Markle: \u0026#39I can\u0026#39t wait to be a mother\u0026#39Being able to see the same GP is harder than ever, despite ministers’ pledgesIt\u0026#39s quicker to get cocaine delivered to your door than a takeaway pizza, report findsDonald Trump announces \u0026#39withdrawal\u0026#39 from Iran nuclear dealPrince Charles and Duchess of Cornwall attend WWII memorial serviceUK, France and Germany pledge to remain in Iran nuclear deal as US withdraws\u0026#39Shocking sham\u0026#39 sees junk food ads targeted at children on Facebook Scottish S4 exam passes fall by nearly 150,000 since new curriculum in 2014Syria accuses Israel of attacking army base near DamascusDad\u0026#39s Army enthusiasts accosted by armed police Mike Pompeo en route to North Korea ahead of US summit with Kim Jong-UnComment: Donald Trump\u0026#39s trashing of the Iran nuclear deal is really about one word: ObamaHeadmistress produces exam stress guide to calm the nerves of parentsComment: A parents\u0026#39 guide to surviving your child\u0026#39s exam seasonRail fares shake-up could see ticket prices increase, admits train industry Cecil Parkinson\u0026#39s disabled daughter wins first round of legal battle against Tory peer\u0026#39s estateDebbie Abrahams sacked from Labour\u0026#39s shadow cabinet after \u0026#39bullying\u0026#39 probeHarry and Meghan\u0026#39s Royal Wedding music will have \u0026#39American slant\u0026#39, conductor saysCabinet split over Northern Ireland veterans as minister refuses amnesty for Troubles troops We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"shocking sham sees junk food ads targeted children facebook2","story":"Prof Russell Viner was among those calling on ministers to do more to prevent childhood obesity Advertising has no impact on obesity, industry chiefs have claimed, as they were accused of presiding over a “shocking sham” which fails to protect children from ads on Facebook.Health campaigners said record obesity levels are being fulled by junk food advertising on Google, YouTube and social networks, saying the sites were not properly regulated.In an inquiry on childhood obesity, MPs took evidence from advertising executives, scientists and paediatricians.And former advertising executives turned on their industry, describing it as a “monster” and saying junk food advertisements should be treated like pornography.Items deemed high in fat, salt or sugar cannot be promoted on shows and other media if at least 25 per cent of their audience is made up of children, or on TV programmes shown after 9pm.But health campaigners said there was little scrutiny of websites, meaning that children could be targeted with ads when playing Minecraft or googling My Little Pony.Former advertising executive Dan Parker, who now runs a health campaign group, said the rules fail to cover the most popular 50 websites. And he called for junk food marketing to be treated like pornography – with access barred to all under-18s.Men and women significantly underestimate their calorie consumptionMr Parker said: “This code does not include Google or any other search engines. It does not include YouTube. It does not include Facebook or Twitter.“If you take the list of the top 50 websites in the UK, not one of them is covered by this code.“What it does is stop junk food advertising on websites likes Disney, Nickelodeon…who to the best of my knowledge they have never run this kind of advertising. It is a shocking sham, the whole piece of regulation,” he said.The former executive began working as a health campaginer after 20 years working in advertising and marketing, with clients including Coca-Cola and MacDonalds.UK rates of obesity are the highest in Western Europe On Tuesday, he told MPs: “We need to stop all forms of marketing of junk foods to our children in whatever form it is. If you talk about porn or sex or violence the other things we dont want our kids to see on telly we dont accept 25 per cent, we don’t accept collatoral damage, or acceptable levels of failure we just don’t have it on the telly before 9pm because we don’t want our kids to see it.”Ministers are currently considering whether an updated strategy on childhood obesity, due later this year, should include a ban on advertising of junk food before 9pm.Kids\u0027 favourites | Ten ideas for healthy snacks and lunchboxesBut industry leaders told the Commons Health Committee that marketing plays almost no part in fuelling obesity.Stephen Woodford, head of the Advertising Association, said their content is only responsible for two per cent of the problem.Asked whether advertising “has any role” in childhood obesity, he said: “No I don’t. Advertising has a small impact on food preferences but it has even less impact on overall diet and it has even less overall impact on obesity.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Look for 100 calorie snacks, 2 a day maxThe new Change4Life campaign sloganPlease review our commenting policyBritain ‘should learn from Japan’ when it comes to care of the elderlyHate preachers who use social media face tougher sentencesMeghan Markle: \u0026#39I can\u0026#39t wait to be a mother\u0026#39Being able to see the same GP is harder than ever, despite ministers’ pledgesIt\u0026#39s quicker to get cocaine delivered to your door than a takeaway pizza, report findsDonald Trump announces \u0026#39withdrawal\u0026#39 from Iran nuclear dealPrince Charles and Duchess of Cornwall attend WWII memorial serviceUK, France and Germany pledge to remain in Iran nuclear deal as US withdrawsScottish S4 exam passes fall by nearly 150,000 since new curriculum in 2014Syria accuses Israel of attacking army base near DamascusDad\u0026#39s Army enthusiasts accosted by armed police Mike Pompeo en route to North Korea ahead of US summit with Kim Jong-UnComment: Donald Trump\u0026#39s trashing of the Iran nuclear deal is really about one word: ObamaHeadmistress produces exam stress guide to calm the nerves of parentsComment: A parents\u0026#39 guide to surviving your child\u0026#39s exam seasonPopular cereals contain sheep\u0026#39s wool grease and are unsuitable for vegans Rail fares shake-up could see ticket prices increase, admits train industry Cecil Parkinson\u0026#39s disabled daughter wins first round of legal battle against Tory peer\u0026#39s estateDebbie Abrahams sacked from Labour\u0026#39s shadow cabinet after \u0026#39bullying\u0026#39 probeHarry and Meghan\u0026#39s Royal Wedding music will have \u0026#39American slant\u0026#39, conductor saysCabinet split over Northern Ireland veterans as minister refuses amnesty for Troubles troops We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/08/TELEMMGLPICT000162697033_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqbH1477TFB5ofB6sXYxNwhPyPp766o0T_Wfr3W_6HxNM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"uk france germany pledge remain iran nucelar deal us withdraws","story":"US President Donald Trump announces his decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear dealBritain, France and Germany have pledged to remain in the Iranian nuclear deal despite Donald Trump pulling America out of the agreement. In a joint statement the countries expressed “regret and concern” over the decision and urged Iran to “show restraint” in its response. Hassan Rouhani, the president of Iran, said that the country would remain in the deal as discussions with allies take place over the next “few weeks”. However he said if talks fail with other partners to the deal then Iran was prepared to restart its uranium enrichment programme. Middle Eastern allies of America welcomed Mr Trump’s decision, with leaders in Israel and Saudi Arabia issuing messages of support. Register or log in to view this and other Politics articles.

Had we relied on these mouse research concepts, we would have been barking up the wrong tree.”Additional reporting by PAor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Quelle horreur. You thought you were making small talk but you’ve accidentally outed yourself as being a bit of a prat.           I had no idea you weren’t supposed to ask people “what they do” until I was about 35 and I read an article by one of those etiquette gurus who if he had any real manners, wouldn’t spend so much time pronouncing on other people’s. It shouldn’t have bothered me, but it did. I was sure I had asked that question on many occasions. I’d certainly answered it. Did people think I was an ill-mannered oaf? The etiquette expert did not, alas, go into the reasons for his pronouncement and I was left none the wiser.I have in the past told people I’m an unemployed stunt rider to circumvent awkward conversationsSo why don’t people like being asked what they do?Maybe it’s because the rest of the question, which generally remains unspoken, is “for a living”. “What do you do for a living?” Already sounds a bit worse, doesn’t it? A bit too personal? Once you know what someone does to get by, it can immediately change your perception of that person. Maybe you were starting to fancy them, but now you know they’re an actuary? Too dull. Or a social worker? Too poor. Or a stay-at-home mum? Oh no. You’ll have to talk about nappies all night.Before you know it, you lazily start to project the cliched characteristics of the occupation onto your new friend and in doing so fail to give yourself a chance to get to know them in any real way. They’ve already been labelled and put in the appropriate box.  Likewise, there’s always the danger that when you tell someone what you do for a living, they’ll have further questions you should actually be charging to answer.Doctors have all experienced the horror of being whisked away from the table at a dinner party to take a quick look at someone’s rash. Lawyers are asked to comment on orce cases at wedding receptions. Plumbers are suddenly handed toilet plungers instead of another glass of champagne.   Everything you need to know about dating app etiquetteNovelists have it worst of all. It’s my experience that upon hearing I’m a novelist (having already worked out that I’m not JK Rowling or EL James), nine out of 10 people want to tell me about the book they’re writing. Could I show it to my publisher? Or they’ll tell me about a story they have that’s just bound to be a bestseller only they don’t have time to write it themselves. Perhaps I could write it for them and they’ll give me 10 per cent of the proceeds? Does that sound reasonable? Only once in my 20-year career has a complete stranger ever told me a story that made me want to reach for my pen.I have in the past told people I’m an unemployed stunt rider to circumvent those awkward conversations, so I do understand why “what do you do” can be a loaded question.But let’s be realistic. It’s not easy to make small talk with a stranger. I would never cut someone dead or judge their social standing just because they’d resorted to the easy questions on a first encounter. Sometimes you really don’t know what else to say. Modern conversation is a veritable minefield. It used to be that you should never talk about religion or politics but the list of subjects that are verboten seems to grow by the day. We can’t all talk about the weather until the end of time. Though having said that, hasn’t the weather been strange?If the question bothers you that much, then I would go with ‘I’m a water slide tester’.When I said I was going to be writing about the questions we just can’t ask each other, because they’re considered impolite or because they’re actually illegal (such as “how old are you” in certain contexts), a friend of mine agreed with the etiquette expert that asking “what do you do” was the very height of bad manners. My friend would admit to having asked the question only once so far as he could remember, saying that he’d deployed it in desperation at a fancy dinner party. His neighbour at the table was monosyllabic. The conversation was going absolutely nowhere so my friend dropped the “wdyd” bomb thinking that at least if he found out his neighbour was an accountant, they could talk about taper relief.“I’m a drummer,” said the man.“In your spare time?”Apparently the conversation didn’t pick up after that.So, what can you ask instead? A better question is perhaps, “What do you do in your free time?” Whereas people often have to work at jobs they hate just to pay the mortgage, what they do in their free time should, by definition, be something they simply enjoy. Maybe the actuary you’ve already dismissed as boring is passionate about the Argentine tango, imbuing every step with the spirit of the brave and unruly gaucho. They might have danced you into bed. So ask what someone loves to do before you ask them what they have to do. Whether the answer is “needlework, specifically cross-stitch” or “attending furring conventions in the New Forest dressed a hamster”, there’s got to be at least 10 minutes more conversation to be had.Eleven etiquette rules to remember next time you flyMan who studied rich people found 3 etiquette aspects they never shirkEtiquette coach prompts outrage by claiming Christmas tinsel is commonIf you say these 28 words, you\u0027re poshA pool etiquette guide for mothers braving a family holidayMeanwhile, the perfect response to “what do you do” has to be “what do I do about what?” If you’re feeling mean, that is. If the question bothers you that much, then I would go with “I’m a water slide tester”. It’s an actual job. You have to rate theme park water slides for exhilaration and splash factor. You just need to be able to swim. Imagine what’ll go through your new friends’ minds when they hear that’s what you get up to all day. Interestingly, despite the etiquette snob’s assertion that enquiring after someone’s occupation marks you out as not being from “the top drawer” as it were, I’ve heard that when they’re meeting people in those interminable line-ups, the Royals always ask “and what do you do?”I wonder if anyone has ever asked the same question in return?*Of course he wasn’t in U2.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The cost of paying privately for dialysis sessions in the EU is up to €1,000 (£880) a week depending on the circumstances and procedures used.”Jeremy Hunt supported Remain during the referendum (Getty)Charities echoed the MEPs’ comments, warning that long-term conditions would continue to “cross borders” whatever the political status of the UK.Fiona Loud, policy director at the charity Kidney Care UK, told The Independent: “Every day we hear from people who are anxious about the very real possibility that their freedom to travel could be curtailed due to changes in reciprocal healthcare rights. Whatever happens as we leave the EU, the needs of people with long-term conditions will continue to cross borders.“For the 29,000 people in the UK who have kidney failure and who need dialysis to stay alive, the EHIC system is essential to allow them to travel in Europe. Everyone has the right to live their lives to the full, including people on dialysis so we need a clear commitment from the government to protect kidney patients post-Brexit. “Whatever happens as we leave the EU, the needs of people with long-term conditions will continue to cross borders.”In the early stages of withdrawal talks, the EU guaranteed that anyone abroad at the point of Brexit would be able to retain their EHIC card. But there has been no reported movement on the status of the card for other travellers, making up the vast majority of the population.Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP and one of the letter’s signatories, added: “Far from providing a boost to the NHS – Brexit means all patients lose their free healthcare rights when travelling abroad in the EU.“It’s time Jeremy Hunt stood up for the NHS and the vulnerable in these negotiations.“Whatever the Brexit deal looks like, the British people should have the final say on whether they think it is as good as the deal we have now inside the EU.”Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The lowest regional support is in the ConnaughtUlster statistical region, at 89 per cent – still an overwhelming figure.  Maybe the Irish should leave the EU87 per cent of those polled believed Ireland had on balance benefited from EU membership, with just 10 per cent disagreeing. Unemployed people were less likely to agree, however, at 70 per cent.Smaller majorities of people supported Ireland contributing more to the EU budget and joining in a future EU defence and security union.Noelle O’Connell, executive director of European Movement Ireland, which commissioned the poll, said: “People are very clear that leaving the EU would not be in Ireland’s interests. However, there is understandable uncertainty about what changes Brexit will bring to Ireland, the border and the Ireland-UK trade relationship in the long term.“Contrary to recent claims, at 92 per cent support for Ireland’s membership of the EU remains strong in fact it is at an all-time high since we first undertook this poll in 2013.”In August 2017 Nigel Farage urged Ireland to leave the EU. “Maybe the best thing for Ireland given that she’s stuck in the wrong currency, given that nearly all of her overseas business is denominated in dollars or sterling, maybe the Irish should leave the EU and then we could then work out our own terms between us,” he said. Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

His version of the facts is totally different from ours."},{"url":null,"title":"weather","story":"BRITAIN is just days away from another blistering heatwave with blazing sunshine and blue skies...WEATHER in Britain could reach record levels over the Bank Holiday weekend as an area of high...BANK holiday Monday could be the perfect day to sunbathe with another heatwave forecast to hit...SNOW could return to the UK this week as temperatures are set to drop, forecasters have warned.BRITAIN is set to sizzle today, with top temperatures reaching 28C on the hottest April day for...BBC WEATHER has forecast scorching temperatures to sweep across the country this week bathing...TORRENTIAL misery-inducing rains will continue to drench the country for weeks, forecasters have...THE Met Office has issued snow weather warnings for parts of the UK as bitingly cold...PARTS of the UK are set to be battered by yet another cold snap over the Easter weekend, with..."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/153/590x/secondary/UK-weather-hot-forecast-heatwave-2018-1335112.jpg","title":"UK hot weather forecast weekend heatwave long range summer 2018 forecast June Met Office","story":"The next hot spell, due next week, could stretch into June\u0026nbspwith golden\u0026nbsprays\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspboiling\u0026nbspthermometers kicking off\u0026nbspsummer,\u0026nbspaccording to\u0026nbsplong-range forecasters.Parts of the country are continuing to bake in some of the highest temperatures ever seen at this time of year after a record-smashing bank holiday.The mercury rocketed to 28.7C (83.66F) in Northolt, London, on Monday making it the hottest May Day weekend in history.The southeast will hold onto the fine weather until mid-week while wind and rain from the Atlantic turn the heat down elsewhere.Temperatures will widely plunge around 10C through towards the weekend with highs of around 17C (62.6F) forecast by Saturday.Low-pressure systems sweeping in from the west will bring bouts of rain and cloudy skies mainly to western and northern regions, experts say.Violent thunderstorms triggered by extreme heat across the south will put the region on alert for torrential downpours and lightning from Tuesday night.However high pressure similar to that responsible for the weekend heatwave is expected to re-build across the nation next week.WX ChartsUK weather forecast: Heatwave to hit next week and last till June in Summer 2018 forecastNetweatherAfter thundershowers the UK will be hit be another heatwaveWhile it is still too early to say whether further records for the month will fall, experts reckon another bout of glorious weather is just around the corner.Met Office forecaster Sophie Yeomans said: \u0026ldquoTemperatures will possibly come up again after the weekend as current models show another region of high pressure building.\u0026ldquoWe think it might turn gradually warmer again through next week and while there is still a lot to play for, all the computer models show there is a chance that this could come off.\u0026ldquoThe high-pressure build is the only similarity to the weather we have had over the past few days that we can see at the moment, it is still early in terms of predicting exactly what will happen.Independent forecasters agree that after a brief pause on the blowtorch conditions, Britain could be thrown back into the furnace within a week.James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, said while it will turn cooler across much of the country temperatures will remain higher than normal for the time of year this week.A swelteringly end to spring could herald an even hotter start to summer with June expected to kick off to searing temperatures, he added.NetweatherParts of the country are continuing to bake in some of the highest temperaturesHe said: \u0026ldquoAbove-average temperatures are likely to persist until at least mid-month although there will be some frontal systems threatening to push in at times from the Atlantic.\u0026ldquoMaximum temperatures will dwindle a little after Tuesday, however, despite this fall meaning it might not be as warm as the weekend, there will be ample sunny periods for many.\u0026ldquoThe back end of the month and the start of June is likely to bring another heat surge to kick off the meteorological summer of 2018.\u0026ldquoHowever, some of these warm to hot periods could become hampered by cloud cover at times giving a muggy feel to affairs.\u0026ldquoThere could be some thunderstorm activity bringing hefty rain or hail showers but as a whole we expect temperatures to be at more near to above-average for the month.Extreme heat across the southeast has sparked warnings to be at the ready for\u0026nbsp explosive thunderstorms through Tuesday night.Wet weather will set in across Scotland and the north on Wednesday morning before sweeping into England and Wales through the day.It is the warmest May bank holiday since records began.

abubakar shekau schoolgirls","story":"The militant groups reign of terror has spanned from Nigeria, through Chad, Niger and Northern Cameroon.They shocked the world when they kidnapped 276 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok in Nigeria prompting a high profile social media campaign that saw everyone from Michelle Obama to David Cameron demand they bring back our girls.At least 82 of the kidnapped schoolgirls were released on Saturday 6 May 2017 after three years in captivity.Boko Haram also sparked global outrage when Sky News obtained footage which showed a scared teen girl who revealed she was paid 40 pence by Boko Haram to carry out a suicide bomb attack.The astonishing video shows the 14-year-old being interviewed by Nigerian cops who stopped her before she could detonate her explosives.Human rights groups have claimed the group has started using babies as suicide bombers.Boko Haram believe in a very strict version of Salafi and Wahabi Islam which forbids, or makes haram, the taking part in anything associated with Western culture.Their wide ranging and deeply conservative interpretation of this bars voting in elections, receiving a secular education or even wearing shirts and trousers.They believe their native Nigeria is run by infidels even when the country elects Muslim presidents.Boko Harams goal is the overthrow of the Nigerian state and running the country according to their twisted world view.The groups official name is Jamaatu Ahlis Sunna Liddaawati wal-Jihad, which in Arabic means People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophets Teachings and Jihad.But locals in the city of Maiduguri, where the group had its headquarters took to calling it Boko Haram.The loose translation from the language of the region is Western education is forbidden.The group was founded in 2002 by Mohammed Yusuf in northeastern Nigeria.He set up a religious complex and school that began to attract poor Islamic families from across the country.The denouncing of corruption in the Nigerian state and police force also attracted many unemployed young men to the cause.For its first seven years the group behaved more or less peacefully living an almost cult like existence separate from regular society.But in 2009 the police arrested nine members of the group and confiscated weapons and bomb-making equipment amid suspicions the group had ties with Al-Qaeda.Yusuf was arrested and reportedly died in custody while trying to escape this act lead to the groups transformation into a far more aggressive jihadi organisation.Yusufs number two Abubakar Shekau took command of the group and the following year they launched several attacks across northern Nigeria.Boko Haram went from strength to strength launching IED attacks and graduating to suicide attacks in 2011, claiming 550 lives.In 2012 half that many were killed again in the first three weeks of the year forcing the Nigerian government to declare a state of emergency.Shekau claims to be an intellectual theologian who has studied Islam.He was born in Nigeria but his age is uknown.It was claimed he was born in the village of Shekau in the Yobe State of Nigeria.In 2013 Boko Haramwere officially declared a terrorist organisation by the USA and the next year stunned the globe with the Chibok kidnapping.Shekau announced he intended to sell the 276 girls into slavery and brought worldwide attention on the group.The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls began trending worldwide and gained the support of Michelle Obama, David Cameron and a host of other celebrities.Government ministers confirmed 82 of the 270 girls were finally freed on Saturday 6 May 2017 in exchange for five high-ranking Boko Haram prisoners.Authorities in Nigeria have warned that the terrorist group are now using babies in their suicide attacks.Two brainwashed women blew themselves up earlier this month killing the two infants they were carrying and four others.The attack took place at a market in Madagali in east Nigeria, on January 13, reports the BBC.The pair of female attackers reportedly passed through a checkpoint while the tragic infants were strapped to their backs.Two male jihadists who were not carrying children were detained at the same security checkpoint.The Nigerian army said in May 2018 it had rescued more than 1,000 people held captive in northeastern Nigeria that had been held by Boko Haram.The people, mainly women and children, were rescued from four villages in Borno state.A multinational task force from Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Benin united to save the captives.Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said earlier this year that the era of Boko Haram violence is gradually drawing to end.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make

Sit up straight – no slouching2. Keep your hands and elbows off the table3. Keep your hat on if you’re a lady remove your hat on entering if you a gentleman4. Never rearrange the china. The teacup handle should be at 3 o’clock with the spoon at 6 o’clock and 12 o’clock5. Allow the server to place your napkin in your lap. If leaving the table during tea place napkin on chair not on the table6. When finished place the knife on the plate at 11 o’clock and 5 o’clock position with blade inward7. Refrain from finger licking8. When drinking tea, quite sips are suggested and refrain from clinking the cup with the spoon when stirring9. When eating a scone cut if crossways, spread with jam and top with cream. Eat the two halves separately10. Never slurp loudly or gulp“It’s absolutely wonderful we have people visiting us from all over the world.“It was similar with Charles and Diana and William and Kate but for Americans this wedding is even more special because we have Meghan - an American woman marrying into the royal family.”While Edmund’s wife Mary is preparing to travel to Windsor Castle for the wedding, Edmund will stay behind and host a royal wedding party where guests are encouraged to wear bridal gowns and bridesmaid dresses.“This wedding is not going to be quite like any other royal wedding …we have this beautiful lady from America who has come from just a normal regular life, nothing to do with royalty.“And she comes and managed to meet Prince Harry who has had an interesting life and fallen in love and I think its a wonderful match.“I think actually Meghan is going to revolutionize the royal family in a way.“I think shes the future of the royal family, to be honest. She brings up brand new feel and look to the royal of the family and she get on with Will and Kate. They call them the fab four and I think they are the wonderful four.“I theyll be able to do a tremendous amount for Great Britain and the Commonwealth because of Megans experience helping people, with children, helping those less fortunate people.“Shes been to London. She had been to Africa several times. I think just the mere fact that they said we dont want any gifts, we would just prefer to have you give something to a charity.I think thats just wonderful way to start.Were thrilled Meghan came to visit us and we would love Meghan and Harry to come and enjoy tea with us again soon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling? Good?’”This heatwave Bank Holiday is the perfect chance to try this experiment, chaps.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They’re following the only possible logic of the Referendum result, the Prime Minister’s own speeches and the Tory manifesto – a document that those remoaning rebels seemed perfectly happy with when they were re-elected off the back of it last year.If a deal between the UK and Brussels stops Britain making independent trade agreements with the rest of the world, or leaves us subject to rules over which we have no say, then it would be a betrayal of the 17.4million people who wanted out of the EU.The Europhile backbenchers know that. If they win this battle, they’ll have succeeded in keeping us in Europe by the back door. They’ll mark it up as a victory, but this isn’t a political game.It would be an insult to democracy and hold our economy back.We must start work on building a truly Global Britain — now.THAT brickies and nurses are now having to scrimp and save for six-figure deposits is nothing short of a national scandal.No recent Government has been willing to grasp this particular nettle.Our housing crisis has been brewing for decades and sorting it will require real radicalism from the new Communities supremo James Brokenshire.He must fight the Nimbys head-on and demand Treasury cash to unleash a building programme.He must also tear up planning laws and look again at the Green Belt. The Tory leadership will be worried about their voters in the shires. But that’s nothing compared to the hit they’ll take for generations if they don’t face up to the challenge.MOTORISTS have been treated like cash cows for far too long.Plans for new “toxic taxes” rub salt in the wound, especially for diesel drivers.It wasn’t that long ago punters were told it was greener to buy diesels, so fining them years later in the name of environmentalism is especially unfair.It must be possible to “go green” without piling misery on hard-working Brits who rely on their motor to get to work, take the kids to school and visit the GP.Time for a u-turn on yet another fuel tax.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now sometimes it’s like everything in my mind is dead.”His mother’s boyfriend told police he had treated him like this as a punishment for “acting inappropriately” to another boy.The mother also lived with her other children, aged 10, three, and 18 months.On one side of the property, a black wooden deck and outdoor spa hid the doors to an underground bunker.Inside was a hydroponic system with chemicals, fans, lighting, power cords and water supply to 225 cannabis plants.Police also found a rifle, swords, flick knives and batons at the property.The boy had been taken out of school two months earlier and reportedly had his head slammed into the container.The boyfriend, 30, was sentenced to a maximum of six and half years with a non-parole period of four years.For her part in the crime, the boy’s mother received three years and five months, with a non-parole period of two years and five months. She will soon be eligible for parole.Her brother was sentenced to two years and three months with a minimum period of two years."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/vlcsnap-2016-06-26-08h45m06s216.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"heidi alexander resigns labour mp london deputy mayor","story":"The ex-shadow health secretary left the Labour bosss top team in June 2016, and joins a string of MPs who have quit the Commons under his watch.A by-election will now be triggered in her safe South London seat, Lewisham East, when she joins the Mayors team in charge of transport, the  reported.Its not possible for her to stay in her job as an MP and also serve as deputy mayor, City Hall said, sparking a potentially bitter battle among Labour factions for who will be chosen to replace her.Ms Alexander previously helped Mr Khan out on his bid to become Labours London Mayoral candidate, and rumours that she would quit had been swirling in Westminster for weeks.She will replace Val Shawcross, who is retiring after 18 years at the Greater London Authority.The departing MP said today that she cant wait to get started and said it was a genuine privillege to represent her area.I have met many brilliant people and made some wonderful friends, she said.And she added: London is a fantastic city. I know Sadiq wants its transport system to be the envy of the world and I am looking forward to playing my part in making that happen.Mr Khan said today he was delighted to welcome his ally to the team.Heidi knows this city inside-out, and her work both as shadow health secretary and campaigning over the best Brexit deal has demonstrated the terrific job she will do as part of my team standing up for London.But Tory Chairman Brandon Lewis blasted: After a dismal set of local election results in which Labour failed to make the gains they boasted about, this is more proof that Labour are too divided to deliver on their promises to working people.This also highlights a complete lack of faith in Jeremy Corbyn and his leadership.She joins a growing list of centrist Labour MPs who have quit their jobs under Jeremy Corbyns leadership.Last week Barnsley moderate Dan Jarvis was elected as metro mayor for Sheffield, but it is unclear if hell remain in his MP job too.Andy Burnham resigned from the Commons when he stood down to become the mayor of Greater Manchester in 2017.Tristram Hunt quit last year to become director of the V\u0026ampA Museum, and Corbyn critic Jamie Reed left to return to his old job in the nuclear industry.MPs piled in to pay tribute to the outgoing MP today.Gavin Shuker said: Parliaments loss is Londons gain.

They used to pre-authorise your card for £1 but now it is £99.“So that is money taken from your account that you can’t use until they release it back once the other payment has cleared.“My complaint to them was that they should have notices on the petrol pumps making customers aware of this as they have changed their policy, 5th of may we got fuel and were still waiting for our refund. Absolute joke.”An Asda spokesman said the fee was issued by Visa and Mastercard and is part of a trial at several stores.A Mastercard spokesman: Last year a change in industry rules meant that petrol stations with automated fuel pumps were required to pre-authorise a value equivalent to a full tank of fuel, so that customers didn’t fill up with more fuel than they could afford.This is designed to protect them, and the petrol station.If customers don’t have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed.While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app - these funds are not taken from their account. Only the value of the petrol dispensed is withdrawn.A Visa spokesman said: “The way that pay-at-pump fuel payments are treated has been standardised across the industry to ensure security for individual cardholders, retailers and card issuers.“When an individual chooses to pay at a pay-at-pump fuel dispenser, an initial amount is held against their account while they dispense their fuel to ensure that they have sufficient funds to pay for the cost of their fuel. This initial amount should be adjusted immediately after fuel is dispensed to reflect the actual cost of the fuel.“Visa has been working closely with card issuing banks to ensure that consumers do not experience delays in the adjustment of the initially-held amount, however if consumers notice that initial amounts held against their accounts are not adjusted immediately, they should raise this with their card issuing bank in the first instance.”Other users expressed their anger at the charge.Charlotte Witcomb wrote: “What a joke.”Hope Sykes added: “It’s not like we have £99 for them to take in the first place.”Find the cheapest fuel prices.Use PetrolPrices.

The answer is that there is a greater connection between the nose and the parts of the brain coding for emotion and memory than for the other senses.By combining an understanding of people’s favourite scents and the sensory benefits of the being near coastal environments, we have been able to create four fragrances that can potentially evoke positive memories and by so doing promote the production of the happy hormone serotonin.*Haven will be releasing a limited number of the fragrances to consumers via Havens blog, By the Beach, and will be reviewing retail distribution in early 2019.Bringing a dose of Vitamin sea into UK homes from four different corners of the UK coastline, the range includes:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This was the first international flight since assuming power. Usually Kim moves about in an armoured train. Unsurprisingly he flew in plane operated by Air Koryo which has been dubbed as the “worst airline in the history of the world”.Two of the carrier’s Soviet Union built jets were spotted. One was an ancient four engine Ilyushin Il-76MD.The other was the SIlyushin IL-62 - the world’s largest airliner when it first went into production in 1963.Only a handful remain because of their vintage.Kim has been pictured aboard the plane before and this was probably the one he flew in. But while his jet is fitted out with all the mod-cons, passengers aboard other Air Koryo planes have to put up with horrid food, torturous propaganda and defective heating.For ages Air Koryo attracted just one star on the global Skytrax ratings.This year it hasnt even been rated.The airlines planes are so old they are banned from the EU amid safety concerns.Few foreigners have flown with Kims creaking airline. One of them was photographer Arthur Mebius who has an affection for the aircraft and crew. He recently released a book called Dear Sky - The Planes and People of North Koreas Airline.His fascinating pictures reveal retro interiors and old-school hostess and pilot uniforms.But because of a lack of funds the planes are falling apart.Some reportedly suffer from problems with their cooling system with condensation dripping down on passengers.All passengers are served the fabled Koryo burger - an unidentifiable slice of processed meat nestling between a stale bun.The burger is always served stone cold and on a paper doily.It also includes a slice of rubbery-looking cheese, a few wispy slices of shredded cabbage or a single lettuce leaf.Some say the mystery sauce is red, some say it’s brown.But most generally agree it’s too watery to be blood left over from the unknown animal that became the patty.In-flight entertainment usually consists of patriotic songs to the leader but since the planes are so loud passengers struggle to hear them anyway. Inside each cockpit is a picture of the man himself.  The airline makes very infrequent international journeys, although its website claims flights serve 23 destinations from Pyongyang, including Beijing, Shanghai and Dalian in China, Kuala Lumpur and Kuwait City.During his visit to the South Korea last month, Kim confessed he was “embarrassed” about his crumbling nations services and “honestly worried” about the south’s leader coming to visit.The dictator appeared to be down on his trains, referring to the South Korean KTX bullet train and saying he didn’t have anything like that in North Korea."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000400889922.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"american airlines emergency landing chicago smoke","story":"According to a passenger, the smoke was coming from the planes cockpit.Travellers on flight AA 2587 reported seeing white mist shortly after taking off from Chicago OHare airport.Bruce Clark tweeted: Texts from my dad enroute to Tokyo on @AmericanAir via ORD to Dallas — smoke in cockpit, making emergency landing.A spokesperson for the company responded on Twitter: Were returning safely back to ORD, and we plan on changing out the plane.

In lab tests, the drug started promoting growth in hair follicles in just two days – that’s pretty quick.“We are looking at using it as a topical treatment, a gel or shampoo that could reach the follicle.”Dr Hawkshaw said there are no known side-effects of the bone drug.The study, published in the journal Public Library of Science Biology, involved hair follicles donated by more than 40 men struggling with baldness.The tissue all started sprouting hair within days of being treated with the drug.Male-pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss, affecting around half of all men by 50 years of age.Currently only two drugs, minoxidil and finasteride, are available to treat the condition.But both have side-effects and do not always work.

Although alcohol can help you fall asleep it is known to disturb sleep in the later part of the night.“Food, alcohol and drinks that contain stimulants like caffeine should be avoided as part of your de-stress pre-bed routine.’’‘’Simple things that trigger early memories of bedtime are usually more effective, such as a warm bubble bath, glass of milk or writing a to-do list.’’The research also revealed adults admitted to feeling ‘stressed’ at least three times daily for over one fifth of their day.And three quarters wish they were less stressed.Thirty-seven per cent will have a bubble bath and three in 10 will simply give someone a hug before bed in order to reduce their stress levels.More than seven in 10 implement these stress-reducing tactics as it helps them to relax, with more than one in four said it helps put them in a good mood.The research also found the top causes of stress which included running late, arguments or deadlines at work.Sam Watts from Sleep Well Milk said: “The research has shown how many of us use quite traditional methods in order to get to sleep, with a number of Britons struggling to get a good night’s sleep due to stress.‘’A good bedtime routine is vital in getting a solid night’s rest, so it’s important to make time to unwind before hitting the pillow.‘’We are creatures of habit and from our earliest days we are encouraged to follow a routine of ‘bath, warm milk and bed’ but as we get older we tend to forget that and wonder why we are not ready to sleep when we climb under the duvet.”The study also reveals interesting differences in de-stressing methods used across the nation.For example, Scots take 50 per cent longer to de-stress than Londoners, whereas having to cook a meal causes Welsh people half as much stress as those living in the East Midlands and driving is a lot less stressful for people living in Northern Ireland than it is in the South West of England."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404379023.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"driver doing crossword busy motorway at 40mph","story":"The woman seems oblivious to the traffic all around her as she ponders the puzzle on the steering wheel in front of her.Mike Yorke, 39, was returning from a camping trip when he spotted the reckless woman filling in the clues on the busy M4.The cabinet maker from Penarth, South Wales, was in the passenger seat while his wife Jemma, 34, a bank manager, was driving.He said: “The traffic was busy and we were doing about 40mph.“My wife said ‘Is she reading the paper?’“I hate people doing what she was doing and not concentrating on the road.“I recorded her and she was doing a crossword, it was just unbelievable.It’s unreal that anyone thinks they should do that while driving on a motorway.”Mike was returning from camping with Jemma and their two children, two and five, in Newport Parrog, West Wales, when they spotted the woman behind the wheel of the red Renault Clio on Monday around 5.30pm.They were on a notoriously dangerous stretch of the M4 near Port Talbot where average speed cameras have been introduced to reduce crashes.The middle-aged woman, wearing a pink top and with a short bob and sunglasses, seemed completely unaware she was being filmed.During the 14-second clip she can even be seen filling in answer, with Mike commenting: “Oh she’s got that one.”He told The Sun last night: “It’s incredibly dangerous.

They can uphold 350 years of press freedom or stop newspapers from holding the rich, the powerful and the corrupt to account. In Britain we believe in decency and fairness. We want those who rig the system, whether it is MPs fiddling their expenses or slum landlords ripping off tenants, to be held responsible. And the main champion of the underdog in our open and democratic society is the Press. Yet the freedoms the Press enjoy – and with it the ability to expose wrongdoing – are under threat.  In the latest World Press Freedom Index, the UK was ranked 40th in the world behind countries such as Jamaica and Chile. And if two Labour MPs have their way today, those freedoms could be further eroded. Tom Watson and Ed Miliband have hijacked the Data Protection Bill by tabling amendments which could have serious consequences for investigative journalism, the viability of local papers and the openness of our democracy. What will the Tom Watson amendment do? The Shadow Culture Secretary is trying to resurrect a modified form of Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Court Act. This proposes that unless papers sign up to the state-recognised regulator IMPRESS, they will have to pay the legal costs of both sides in data protection cases, even if they win. The amendment exempts not-for-profit publishers such as the  and the Observer and titles in specific regions with a turnover below \u0026pound100million. But it would still cover 85% of local papers as most are owned by media companies, such as the Mirror’s publisher Reach, with turnovers above that amount. Watson is a friend of former Formula One boss Sir Max Mosley, who has harboured a deep loathing for newspapers since the News of the World revealed he took part in an S\u0026ampM party with prostitutes.  He bankrolls IMPRESS through an arms-length charity and also gave Watson a \u0026pound500,000 donation to fund office costs and staff  – money Watson has declined to give back despite the revelation Mosley published a campaign leaflet in the 1960s which linked non-white immigrants to diseases such as VD and leprosy.   Why should it be resisted? Local newspaper editors and freedom of speech campaigners say the amendment will cause irreparable damage to journalism. Editors will not be able to risk running stories exposing corruption or wrongdoing if they know it will result in expensive legal action. Jodie Ginsberg of Index on Censorship said it could be used by people to avoid exposure, even in cases such as the Windrush scandal where exposure is in the public interest. The main beneficiaries of Watson’s amendment would be those who want to wipe their grubby reputations clean by removing stories from the internet. This could include paedophiles with historical convictions or shady businessmen who want to start up their next dodgy venture. These are the sort of people who would threaten us with a data protection claim, knowing we would have to pay all the costs of the case unless we removed the articles about them from our websites, preventing you from seeing the truth. Mosley recently threatened the Mirror with a Data Protection Act claim concerning revelations about him that were heard in open court and are still available online. We are defending it vigorously. However, if the Watson amendment goes through, Mosley would get all the costs of his claim even if he lost, unless we were to join IMPRESS, the regulator HE helped found and finances through a trust. Media lawyer Antony White says the Watson amendment could also be illegal.  Who regulates the press? In the wake of the phone hacking scandal, the British press has changed the way it operates. Following the recommendation of Sir Brian Leveson’s inquiry, the majority of the country’s papers set up an independent regulator called IPSO. More than 2,600 print and online titles are now covered by IPSO which has the power to impose fines of up to \u0026pound1million and demand front page apologies for serious breaches. An independent review of IPSO by Sir Joseph Pilling found it to be independent, effective and compliant with most of Leveson’s recommendations. What is wrong with IMPRESS? No title of any significance has signed up to IMPRESS – and there are not just concerns about the motives of Mosley. It is governed by a Royal Charter, which in turn is overseen by politicians on the Privy Council. Any organisation that accepts it as its regulator also agrees, by extension, to state control. While the present regime may not interfere through the Privy Council, a future regime could use it to exert control over the press.

Theresa May has insisted Britain will also leave the European Union\u0027s single market and customs union after it quits the bloc next March. A total of 83 Labour peers voted for an amendment tabled by Lord Alli which would see the UK remain part of the European Economic Area - and effectively the single market. The government suffered two earlier losses, when peers backed plans to remove references to official Brexit date from the face of the bill as well as plans to keep the UK in EU agencies after Brexit. The vote to stay in the Single Market passed by 245 to 218, majority 27, in defiance of both the Government and Opposition frontbenches.  Labour\u0027s official stance was to abstain but 83 Labour peers rebelled against the frontbench while 17 Tories rebelled against the Government by supporting the amendment. The EEA allows for the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital within the European single market. Labour\u0027s Lord Alli said continued membership of the EEA was vital to ensure the future profitability of the UK\u0027s export business.  He said: It is the EEA that deals with services, services like retail, tourism, transport, communications, financial services and aerospace where we have a \u0026pound14 billion trade surplus in these services. The customs union only will benefit our European neighbours in their imports and without an EEA equivalent it will damage our profitable export business and therefore the jobs and livelihoods of many thousands of people. It\u0027s for that reason that we need to ensure that any continuation of the customs union must include a continuation in the EEA or its equivalent.  Tory former minister Baroness Verma spoke in favour of the amendment, telling peers that continued membership of the EEA offered businesses certainty. Labour former Cabinet minister and ex-European trade commissioner Lord Mandelson also spoke passionately in support of the amendment, warning peers not to be bullied and to do what was right for the country. Stressing the huge importance of services to the UK economy, Lord Mandelson warned the impact of quitting the single market without EEA access on cross-border delivery of services to Europe would be savage with a significant proportion of broadcast production, banking and insurance hit for six. Responding for the government, Brexit minister Lord Callanan warned remaining in the EEA would not deliver control of our borders or our laws.  He said: On borders it would mean that we would have to continue to accept all four freedoms of the single market, including freedom of movement.  On laws it would mean the UK having to implement new EU legislation over which in future we will have little influence and, of course, we will have no vote. This will not deliver on the British people\u0027s desire as expressed in the referendum to have more direct control over decisions that affect their daily lives. Labour rebels backing the amendment included former party leader Lord Kinnock, Lord Mandelson and ex-Cabinet minister Lord Hain. The Tory rebels included former Cabinet minister Lord Patten of Barnes and former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock pointed out that MPs were whipped to vote in favour of an amendment in line with the one proposed by Lord Alli back in December. Commenting on tonight\u0027s defeat for the Government in the House of Lords on the Single Market, Liberal Democrat Leader in the Lords, Lord Newby said: “This victory sends a clear message to those sat round the Cabinet table that Parliament won’t just sit back while Theresa May leads us towards a hard Brexit.

The one-use wipes are among a string of items set for the chop in the government’s crackdown on waste. Cotton buds and plastic straws are already expected to be banned, and every supermarket chain in Britain has pledged to wipe out unnecessary plastics by 2025. It comes after reports that more than 5,000 wipes had collected in a 116 square metre area of the River Thames, near Hammersmith Bridge. It’s the highest number ever found in a single place and changed the shape of the river bed, with mounds visible above the water at low tides.  Some wet wipes are made with polypropylene - meaning they won\u0027t break down in the sewers and instead either clog our drains or wash up on our beaches. But even wipes which are labelled \u0027flushable\u0027 often contain plastic, meaning they will not biodegrade. The Marine Conservation Society says that the number of wet wipes found on UK beaches has increased by almost 700% over the last decade. A spokesperson for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “As part of our 25-year environment plan we have pledged to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste, and that includes single-use products that include plastic such as wet wipes.”  When one Mumsnet user spoke out last year calling for a ban on baby wipes, the idea was met with a frosty response, the Derby  reports.

Labour will force a binding vote that sources claim could force the Prime Minister “back to the drawing board”. Bursaries have already been axed last year. But Labour says its motion - if it passed - would effectively stop the system that replaces them becoming law. Labour sources claim this would send a “clear message from the Commons” that the grants should be brought back.  Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said axing bursaries “led to a huge fall in numbers applying for these courses and threatens to make the NHS staffing crisis even worse.” Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner added: “If Tory MPs want their constituents to believe they want to protect our NHS, then they will have to vote for it.”  Nursing students have been forced take loans for their living costs and fees of up to \u0026pound9,250 since bursaries were ditched in September 2017. Applications have already plummeted from 65,620 in 2016 to 53,010 in 2017. And an government impact assessment in February admitted the cut could put poor, female and older students off entering the profession. Mrs May - who has a tiny majority - faces the threat that her DUP allies may fail to back her in the vote. The 10 Northern Irish MPs’ deal to prop up her government only extends to major votes on the Queen’s Speech, Budget, Brexit and national security.

The photograph of the Prime Minister was put on display last week at the university’s School of Geography and the Environment as part of a celebration of the department’s female alumnae. But following protests by students it has been removed. A Twitter account called NotAllGeographers was set up to protest the portrait. Students put up a free space asking people to share their thoughts on pieces of coloured paper surrounding the photograph of the PM who graduated with a second-class degree in 1977.  One student wrote: “School of Geography and (Hostile????) Environment” [sic], while another message said: “Let in every refugee, throw the Tories in the sea.”  Andrew Dwyer, a cyber security and geography student, wrote on social media: “(Not so) Great to see Theresa May placed alongside Doreen Massey in [the School of Geography], apparently one of the best alumnae we have. I don\u0027t really wish to celebrate a hostile environment for immigrants, if I\u0027m honest.”    The campaigning group said on Twitter:  #NotAllGeographers have creatively intervened for geographers everywhere to challenge the installation of a Theresa May portrait in Oxford Geography without consultation of the student body (at least).  This is unacceptable and does little to inspire confidence in critical thought.  The group\u0027s name builds upon a hashtag used during the recent UCU strikes distancing current students from the vice chancellors who also studied geography. The collection of photographs were chosen by past and current members of the department to “inspire the next generation of women geographers to aim high in their future careers.    #NotAllGeographers told student newspaper the Cherwell: “Clearly at a time when there are issues with the Windrush scandal and the handling of Brexit [she is] a contentious figure in a department with many EU citizens and decolonial scholars.   “The main, and most basic, issue comes with the celebration of a sitting Prime Minister. Should a department align itself with the power of the day, when there are those who actively challenge it? “It is unprecedented to celebrate state power in such a way (regardless of one’s political affiliation).  In a note alongside the picture, Mrs May – who studied at the university from 1974 to 1977 – said: “I remember the School of Geography as a great place to meet, learn and enjoy finding out more about our world… “A greater understanding of the diversity and complexity of our world and a respect for our environment, which I learnt in my degree, have stood me in good stead in my chosen career.”   The Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman said it was a matter for the college. But he pointed to her views on the importance of women in senior positions in public life and her “pride in what women have achieved in those senior positions”.

MPs issued a scathing report as they warned social care faces being “on its knees” without a long-term plan by the end of this year.  The Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the sector suffers “low pay, low esteem and high turnover of staff” - which risks being made worse by Brexit.  Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier, a Labour MP, declared: “The sector is scraping by.  “And without an explicit, long-term plan backed by Government it could soon be on its knees. “Levels of unmet need are high and rising short-term funding fixes are a road to nowhere and the ingrained issues that lead to high turnover in the workforce could be compounded by Brexit.  “We urge Government to publish this year, and then implement, a credible long-term funding plan for care.” Theresa May is set to unveil a long-term NHS funding plan this year.

Bungling Caroline Nokes was forced to correct herself minutes after telling MPs: “I don’t think I’ve had any cases of wrongful deportation brought to my attention.” Her claim was instantly contradicted by Labour MP Stephen Doughty, who unveiled a letter by Ms Nokes’ predecessor showing his constituent was wrongly deported to Somalia. Hugh Ind, Home Office Director-General of Immigration Enforcement, then confirmed there were “a handful” of wrongful deportations in six years - estimating around five. Asked why no one briefed her about the cases - which are not Windrush citizens - Ms Nokes said: “I don’t think I can answer that.”  The furious clash, at a three-hour hearing of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, sparked fresh questions about ministers’ competence in the wake of the Windrush scandal .   It came as reports emerged that the Home Office was repeatedly warned Windrush citizens were being wrongly classed as illegal immigrants as early as 2013. Ms Nokes confirmed the Home Office is combing through 8,000 records of Windrush-era citizens who “may have been removed incorrectly” since 2002. She stressed that did not mean 8,000 people were wrongly removed, and officials had still not found one wrongful Windrush removal, “but it’s very clear that people have been detained.” But Mr Doughty fumed: “Why should we have any confidence that when you’re doing the deep trawl of Windrush cases you’ll be able to find out what’s gone on?”  Labour MP Naz Shah said: “You got it wrong on Windrush. How much more do you want to get wrong?” Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper warned there was a “culture of disbelief” in the Home Office and “pressure in the Home Office to get as many people as possible to leave”. She declared: “It does feel like, frankly, the system is in a real mess.”  It came as the government launched an urgent inquiry into events leading to Amber Rudd ’s resignation as Home Secretary.  Theresa May’s ethics tsar Sir Alex Allan will probe what advice officials gave before Ms Rudd wrongly claimed “we don’t have targets” for removing illegal migrants. Home Office chiefs confirmed there were targets to remove illegal migrants in 2015/16, 2016/17, and 2017/18. In 2017/18 it was set at 12,800 “enforced returns” and later lowered to 230 to 250 per week.  But MPs branded the Home Office’s most senior civil servant “slippery” after he described the figure as an “expectation” or “ambition”, not a “target”. Permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam also faced disbelief as he tried to rebuff questions by saying: “I’m not an expert on the immigration system”. MP John Woodcock branded Sir Philip “Sir Humphrey-tastic” and the lack of knowledge “embarrassing”, telling the top mandarin: “Do you understand how absurd this sounds to normal people?” Mr Woodcock also accused top Home Office civil servant Glyn Williams of “lying” about removal targets in an earlier hearing. Sir Philip said the claim was “a very serious accusation of dishonesty which I do not accept.” Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper told Sir Philip: “This is basically like you’re playing games with us. It’s like if we don’t use the right word in the question it’s okay for you not to give us proper information. “It all feels really slippery.” Mr Doughty accused officials of “slippery tactics”. He added: “What on earth is going on in your department if we can’t get answers to the most basic questions that have been repeatedly raised with you?” The \u0027Windrush generation\u0027 are British residents who arrived from Commonwealth countries before New Year\u0027s Day 1973. They are named after the Empire Windrush, the ship which brought some of the first Caribbean migrants to Britain in 1948. Anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1973 has a legal right to stay, unless they left the UK for more than two years. But they faced being threatened with deportation under new immigration rules despite living and working here for decades. People were ordered to prove they have the right to be in the UK to rent property, work or access services and benefits. The government failed to keep detailed records of Windrush arrivals, and landing cards were destroyed in 2010. The Home Office set up a task force with the aim of sorting out cases within two weeks. Windrush immigrants are also being granted fee-free citizenship and a compensation scheme, the rules of which have not been set yet.

It came as enforcement chief Mr Ind admitted there was a “deep problem” with unlawful immigration detention - with \u0026pound3.3million paid out in compensation to victims last year. HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke told MPs he was still waiting for detention centres to draw up improvement plans as far back as 2016.

Paulina Gancarz, 34, who had been going through a bitter divorce, was five times the drink-drive limit when she was found behind the wheel of her Mini Cooper in a layby last month. The mum-of-one was arrested and bailed but on the day she was to appear in court two weeks later she was found to be more than three times the limit after she crashed her Mini outside a Marks and Spencer in Cheshire at 7am. Gancarz - who ran her own accountancy firm - wept as she admitted drink driving and failing to provide a specimen of breath at Stockport Magistrates Court. But she was spared jail after saying the offences arose from an acrimonious split with her husband which cost her \u0026pound65,000 in lawyers\u0027 fees.  Gancarz claimed her traditional Polish mother had been putting pressure on her, had been looking after her seven year old daughter and had disapproved of the divorce which saw her lose her business and subsequently get a job on a much lower salary as an accounts assistant. She said had decided to get away from her mother by sleeping overnight in her car with a bottle of wine and drive home the next day. She also said she did not know being drunk at the wheel of a parked car was an offence in the UK. The court heard the offences occurred between April 14 and April 30, two years after Gancarz broke up with her husband who is also an accountant. Prosecutor Miss Tina Cunnane said: The defendant was sat in the driver seat of her vehicle when she was stopped by the police.  They asked her to participate in a road side breath test, which she complied with and blew a reading of 182mg in 100ml of breath. They asked her to come to the station to provide another specimen but she refused so she was charged with failing to provide a specimen. The next offence occurred shortly after crashing her car, it was apparent she had been drinking alcohol. Security staff were made aware and contacted the police. On that occasion she blew a reading of 109mg in 100ml of breath. A probation report compiled by an unnamed officer was read to the court and said: Mrs Gancarz does have depression and anxiety, she is on medication for this. She went through a difficult divorce some two years ago, losing a lot of money, she lost two business and spent \u0026pound65,000 on solicitor fees.  She is working, albeit for a much lower salary, as an accounts assistant. On April 14 she had been having an issue with her mother who was over to help with her daughter, she was very depressed and she was not coping very well. Mrs Gancarz\u0027s mother came to visit her from Poland. She was not happy with her situation and the fact she was looking after her daughter on her own following the divorce. She was coming to help her with the situation but they have a difficult relationship. She put a lot of pressure of her. Her parents are quite traditional. Things like when she was married, she was in a good position financially, they were more supportive yet when she was divorced the attitude of her parents changed a lot. She wasn\u0027t coping very well. On the 14th she was going to go and buy a bottle of wine so that she could escape for a while. She parked in a lay-by in Wilmslow and there she said her intention was to drink the wine, sleep in her car and go home the next day.

Claire Upshall, now 28, went to work at an orphanage in 2009, where she fell in love with little orphan Alfie, then aged one. She travelled back to the UK when her seven weeks were up, but she couldn\u0027t get Alfie out of her mind and within weeks she quit her job and headed back to Africa. There she began to care for 200 orphaned or abandoned children. And over just a 13 month stretch she adopted Alfie and three more children from orphanages - Layla and Isabella, now both eight, and Jack, now five.  Single mum Claire is now amid a \u0026pound34,000 battle to get her family to the UK. Unable to find work in Tanzania she has just weeks of savings left, and is crowdfunding to pay for the flights, visas and paperwork to get back to the UK where she\u0027ll get work. Claire from Christchurch, Dorset, said: When I went out for that first trip it was a dream come true to live and work in the orphanage, constantly hearing the laughs and cries of the little ones. I developed a connection with Alfie very early on, but I didn\u0027t for a minute think I would become his mum - that was never the plan.  But I fell in love with the country, the people, the babies and more specifically, that one little boy. One by one our little family grew and I went from one to four in 13 months. It\u0027s not what I had in mind when I went out there aged 19, but it just fits and I couldn\u0027t imagine life any differently now. I always thought it would be important for my children to be in their own culture, and I still think their culture is incredibly important. But I need paid work, and can\u0027t find it, and there is a lot to be said about the importance of growing up around your extended family.  I made that decision in late 2014 - and I\u0027ve been working towards it ever since. Claire said when she was a little girl she\u0027d talk about her dream of looking after the babies in Africa. She was working as a nanny when she flew to Tanzania on New Year\u0027s Eve 2009 for seven weeks after Googling \u0027African baby home\u0027. \u0027New kid\u0027 Alfie, then 13-month-old was placed in her arms and she soon made it her personal mission to get the serious little toddler to smile I spent a lot of time caring for him and after a couple of weeks he started smiling at me - but only me, she said.  Now that serious little boy is my eldest son. She was in floods of tears when it was time to come home in February 2009, and within weeks she\u0027d quit her job to return for a further five weeks with Alfie and the kids. It helped her make up her mind to come home to the UK and work for a year to fund a longer stretch abroad. After a year as a live-in nanny, she moved back to Tanzania in May 2011, to manage the orphanage, in charge of 20 staff and up to 54 babies at a time. Little Alfie had been moved to another orphanage 15km away, and she visited hoping to sponsor his education - but ended up adopting him.  Within five months he was living with me as my son. Now he\u0027s nine. He didn\u0027t speak a word of English and she spoke no Swahili at the time, but they bonded by rolling bouncy balls down the corridors of their new home. I loved him and he loved me and we just fitted together as a team. Just a couple of months later, in December 2011, two-year-old Layla was welcomed into the family. \u0027Girly girl\u0027 Layla could no longer be cared for by her parents, and had met Claire during her first volunteering stint, when she was just five-months-old.  Claire would often short-term foster particularly vulnerable and malnourished children from the orphanage, to give them round the clock care. Just three months after her brood grew to two, she was called to pick up a tiny girl from a nearby village, who could no longer be cared for by her parents. Claire was told the 10lb \u0027baby\u0027 was five-months-old, but she turned out to be an extremely malnourished two-year-old. Caring Claire took her in full-time to give her the best chance of survival and four months on, in July 2012, Isabella, now eight, was officially handed over to Claire. She just instantly fit in and was part of the family, said Claire.  I sort of thought \u0027what\u0027s another one?\u0027, you know. Six months on Claire moved to Arusha, Tanzania, to set up a new baby orphanage in March 2012. She met 4lb abandoned baby Jack, then ten days old, eight months later when she picked him up from hospital. Jack was so small he needed to be woken up to feed, and needed constant warmth, so Claire carried him in a \u0027kangaroo\u0027 sling while she worked in the office. Waking up through the night to feed him cemented their bond, and she adopted him eight months later in August 2013. In 13 months I went from caring for one to caring for four, she said. Sometimes when I think about it, I realise it is a bit crazy, but it just fitted and felt right.  Ever since I was a young girl I wanted a big family. When I got Alfie I did think \u0027two and I\u0027ll stop\u0027, but it just happened and it worked, and my childhood wish came true. With four children to look after, she left the orphange to support her super-sized family and has been searching for paid work ever since. The four children are now thriving at school, and Claire is almost fluent in Swahili, but she has found it impossible to find work. She has relied on regular payments from her parents, Helen, 63, a catering worker, and Derek, 65, a retired carpenter, who passed away earlier this year. She has also returned home for short work stints when money was particularly tight, and has been helped by friends and family back in the UK.

The poll of 2,000 adults revealed a huge amount of confusion about the advice and old wives tales the nation follows with a third mistakenly believing that chewing gum really does take seven years to digest. Others stick to the belief that not eating food after 8pm helps you to lose weight or that sugar is a great source of energy, despite the boost it gives you often being followed by a drop in energy levels. And more than a tenth work with the saying ‘no pain, no gain’ when it comes to exercise – something which could be leaving them at risk of serious injury.  But apples really can help clean your teeth, with the fibrous content of the fruit acting as a toothbrush, scrubbing plaque and food debris from the teeth. Despite many food facts being proven to be incorrect, 39 per cent admit to living by the ‘recommendations’. Anna Lioni, brand manager for Spatone, which commissioned the survey, said: “There are loads of myths and old wives’ tales about food. “And rarely a day goes by without it being reported that certain things which were once deemed healthy are now a risk, and vice versa. “And sometimes, what works for one may not work for another. But there are plenty of food myths that have been proven conclusively to be untrue.”  One in five Brits also believe eggs are bad for you due to their high cholesterol levels, a ‘fact’ which has been debunked in recent years. In fact, a quarter of the population have been ‘shocked’ to find out a piece of food advice they’d been following for years has turned out to be wrong. But swearing by tips and advice over the years they believed to be true has left some adults struggling with their diet. Almost four in 10 worry they don’t always get the energy they need from the food they consume to get them through the day. And half of the population went as far as to say they sometimes feel they are running on empty.  Less than one in 10 Brits describe their daily energy level as ‘excellent’, with more describing their general level of energy as ‘poor’. And during an average day, Brits spend more than three and a half hours feeling low on energy, turning to bananas, coffee and chocolate to give them a boost. Brits will even wake up seven times each month and feel like they don’t have enough energy for the day ahead – before they’ve even got out of bed. Unsurprisingly, a weekend’s excess means Monday is the day we’re most likely to feel lethargic, followed by the midweek hump of Wednesday and Thursday. Anna Lioni added: “Our survey results found some worrying statistics about the lack of knowledge around energy sources. “And it also showed more than half of Brits have felt so low in energy, they actually thought they were falling ill – with a quarter then consulting a doctor or health professional. “Often, a lack of energy comes from a missing nutrient or vitamin, which supplements can help with – as part of a healthy, varied diet.” "},{"url":null,"title":"fizzy drinks uks biggest cinema","story":"NewsFizzy drinks at some of the UK\u0027s biggest cinema chains found to have \"unacceptable\" bacteria levelsA probe by BBC Watchdog Live revealed the shock findings, with dangerous salmonella discovered in two drinks on sale at multiplex giant Odeon\u0026nbspShareByDave Burke00:07, 9 MAY 2018Updated00:08, 9 MAY 2018NewsBosses at Odeon say they have opened an investigation into the BBC Watchdog findings\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFizzy drinks on sale at three of Britain’s biggest cinema chains contain up to 10,000 times more bacteria than is acceptable, an investigation has found. A probe by BBC Watchdog Live revealed the shock findings, with dangerous salmonella discovered in two drinks on sale at multiplex giant Odeon. The programme, due to be aired tonight, will report that swab tests carried out at 30 branches of Vue, Cineworld and Odeon found seven drinks contained worrying levels of bacteria. On top of this, nine of the cinemas were found offering ice with unacceptable amounts of bacteria. Tony Lewis, head of policy at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said the results showed venues had been “cutting corners”, and told the programme: “I’m concerned we’ve got an indicator of hygiene failure and potential breakdown in terms of management of hygiene in those businesses.”  Chiefs at Odeon - where two high bacteria drinks were found, one containing 10,000 times more than it should - last night said they were investigating and said they took immediate steps to improve hygiene. At one Odeon branch, harmful bacteria listeria - which causes an illness called listeriosis - was found on a drinks holder. An Odeon spokesman told The Mirror: “We were therefore surprised and disappointed at the Watchdog findings and immediately launched our own thorough investigation. “We want to reassure our guests that we have taken immediate steps and have further strengthened procedures with our teams across the UK.” Vue - where one drink was found to have 100 times the accepted level of bacteria, and two ice samples revealed unacceptable bacteria levels - refuted the findings to the show. At Cineworld four drinks and four ice cube samples had unacceptable bacteria levels, with one drink containing 70 times more than is acceptable. Cineworld told the Mirror all the cinemas where tests were carried out had been awarded the maximum Food Hygiene Rating of 5 by their local authority.

According to insiders workers repairing the roof of Apartment 1, Kensington Palace, were instructed to complete the job quickly, as Prince Harry made it clear him and Meghan plan to start a family soon. Royal courtiers were last year keen to let it be known that the couple would immediately be living at Nottingham Cottage - Harry’s batchelor pad in the grounds of the Kensington Palace - for the foreseeable future. But insiders have known for some time that it was always Harry\u0027s intention to move out of the cosy two-bed Nott Cott as soon as possible and into Apartment 1 - a stunning 21-room wing of the palace.  It was revealed yesterday that the Duke of Gloucester agreed to move out of Apartment 1 shortly after the engagement to allow Harry and Meghan to move in. The Daily Mail\u0027s Royal expert Richard Kay wrote: “Soon after their engagement, the Queen’s cousin Richard — the Duke of Gloucester, 73 — whose three children are now grown up, offered to vacate his splendid 21-room Apartment 1 at the palace so Harry and Meghan could have it — it is next door to William and Kate. The question was, where would the Gloucesters go? “Now the problem has been solved with the departure of the Queen’s private secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt. This has freed up his smaller but very comfortable apartment, seen as ideal for the unfussy Gloucesters, who still carry out many official duties.    The Queen has allowed father-of-two Sir Christopher, 56, to stay on for six months at the prestigious address until the end of the school year. “So when will Harry and Meghan move in? Well, it was more than a year after their wedding before William and Kate moved into Princess Margaret’s old home. “Right now Meghan and Harry are content with the intimate comforts of Nottingham Cottage, with its open fire and chintzy furnishings. Meghan’s influence is everywhere — cashmere throws, scented candles and vases of fresh flowers. “They are putting off as long as possible the dreaded time when they will have to have umpteen servants.  They borrow staff from Clarence House to help out when they really need them for dinner parties. Neither of them is a very good cook. “This extends to cleaning the cottage. Rather than have their own staff, they are using contract cleaners Mitie, the company that ‘does’ the royal palaces. “At the same time, they have been slipping away from the bustle of London to the relative peace of Windsor, where a bolthole at the castle has been made available for their occasional use as they prepare for what will be one of the most microscopically observed occasions of recent times.” Harry and Meghan certainly seem to be in rather a hurry to get a family started. The pace of their romance has been swift to say the least in Royal terms.  Harry spoke back in November of last year about the speed at which he fell for Meghan - it was love at first sight, he said. Lifting the lid on their whirlwind romance, he said \u0027the stars were aligned\u0027 when \u0027this beautiful woman fell into my life\u0027. Harry, 33, also promised he and the American actress, 36, will start a family \u0027in the near future\u0027. The compact cottage is no place for a young prince and his bride to plan for a family. And this might well explain the pace at which work has been rattling on at Apartment 1.  As news crew gathered on last November on the east side of Kensington Palace, it almost seemed as if workers on the roof on the west side of the building were trying to hurriedly remove the gleaming white plastic covering in double quick time so as not to draw attention to renovations. Beneath the sheets it was plain to see that renovations to the roof of Apartment 1 had been happening at lightening quick pace after only a few weeks with new mortar pointing over the chimney stacks clearly visible. Panoramic pictures of the Kensington Palace back then showed the world\u0027s media on the east side of the palace while work on Apartment 1 rattled along unnoticed on the west side of the building. Pictures taken in November showed the entire Apartment 1 still shrouded in white tarpaulins.  Apartment 1 adjoins the 20-room Apartment 1A which Harry’s brother Prince William and his growing family live in. William and Kate also lived at Nottingham Cottage before they started a family - it almost seems like a right of passage for the two Royal brothers. Work on apartment 1 is now almost completed - just in time for Harry\u0027s wedding to Meghan in less than two weeks’ time. The Gloucesters also have other properties they can happily spend time at. A source said: “The Gloucesters have two other properties: Barnwell Manor in Northamptonshire, which they rent out, and a weekend cottage in Gloucestershire, which they could retire to.”  Several years ago a royal spokesman said that Harry had set his sights on grander accommodation at Kensington Palace but refused to confirm which apartment it was, other than to say it was currently occupied. In 2014, another member of the family, Princess Michael, suggested in an interview with Tatler magazine that Apartment 1 would be perfect for Harry to move in to when he got older and wanted to start a family. Princess Michael said William and Kate have a “lovely big apartment, next to the Gloucesters, who I think will leave their enormous apartment because their children have gone.” She added: “They’re rattling around this huge space and I think Prince Harry might go there. Then they’d be next door to each other - very good move.”  It has been rumoured for some time that Harry had his eyes on another larger apartment in Kensington Palace for him and Meghan to move into. The rumoured new apartment was said to be much closer to the huge wing that has been home for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge since September, when they moved back to London from Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate to coincide with Prince George starting school in Battersea. Indeed Apartment 1 and Apartment 1A are as close together as it is possible to be - they are linked by adjoining doors so Harry and Meghan can come and go to see Kate and William and also visit young Prince George and Princess Charlotte whenever they choose. ‘It\u0027s sweet that Harry and Meghan will be living next to William and Kate. When Harry and Meghan move in permanently, it will be like when William and Harry were kids when their mother was alive - living next door to one another at Kensington Palace.

But the 43-year-old has spoken out in a bid to convince the nation she is not evil and insist she knew nothing of the snatch plot that shocked the nation. Matthews even offered to take a lie detector test about what happened to her daughter when she vanished in February 2008 before being found at an accomplice’s flat tethered to a bed. And without any hint of remorse over the sick kidnap, she pointed to other vile criminals to justify her claim that she should not be branded evil. Mum-of-seven Matthews said: “I’m not Britain’s worst mum. I didn’t kill anybody. “Baby P’s mum and Maxine Carr don’t get the abuse that I do. “None of it’s true. I’m on the edge. It makes me want to kill myself but I’d never do that. I’m scared I’ll die lonely and alone.”  Despite being found guilty of snatching Shannon when the youngster was nine and serving four years of an eight year sentence, Matthews still refuses to accept she took any part in the plot to cash in on \u0026pound50,000 reward money. She said she was made a “scapegoat” and added: “From the start I didn’t know where she was. Others were involved. I didn’t have a clue. “You can’t kidnap your own child. I know the truth and I wasn’t involved in it. I still have nightmares thinking that it’s all going to happen again. “I want to take a lie detector test to prove my innocence.” But she says she fears she won’t be forgiven. Shannon was kidnapped from near her home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorks. Her disappearance sparked a massive month-long police search. Matthews and her then boyfriend Craig Meehan joined the hunt and she made several public appeals for help to find her daughter. Shannon was found on March 14 at Michael Donovan’s flat in nearby Batley Carr. She had been drugged. Donovan was also found guilty of kidnap, sentenced to eight years and released after four. But he was recalled to prison in 2012 after a bust-up in Leeds.  Born-again \u0026shyChristian Matthews spoke about her time behind bars. She said: “When I was first in jail I thought I was going to die. I panicked. “They were banging on my cell door saying, ‘Come out here, you dirty nonce.’ Prison made me weaker. I don’t feel like the same person any more. I was beaten up inside because of who I was. “Once they threw a snowball with a rock in it at me and other times I was punched. I didn’t say anything, I was too scared.” But Matthews insisted she did make friends, including a transgender prisoner in Peterborough’s segregation unit. And she claimed she had admirers on the outside. She said: “Men used to write to me with semi-naked pictures and ask if I fancied meeting up because everyone makes mistakes.” Matthews also used our interview to deny claims she has a 72-year-old “sugar daddy”, Eric Anderson. She said: “I have standards. I’m very lonely and I found a friend who I thought I could trust. A true friend. “He was just somebody to talk to because I’ve got nobody else. Somebody has blown our relationship out of context. He did give me money because he wanted to help me. “He got the money from some inheritance and said he wanted to help me out because I’m struggling. “He’s like a father figure to me, like an uncle. There’s no sex involved. I’ve known him for years. Eric takes me for coffee and KFC and tells me not to go with the nasty men I have met and not to be taken advantage of. I’ve sworn off men. I will never get married. I don’t trust them at all. “I’m trying to get my life back on track and everything that is being said is not true.”  Matthews also denied claims she was selling sandwiches to the \u0026shyhomeless that had been handed out free by Pret a Manger shops. She said: “I never sold them I gave them to the homeless. “This woman that’s a church person was handing them out. “It was getting dark earlier and I used to go to help pick them up and take them to the homeless around the station. Sometimes I’d take them to the \u0026shySalvation Army. It makes me sick what was said, that’s not me. I was doing it out of the goodness of my heart.” Matthews was relocated to a town in the south of England for her own safety after being released from prison. She said she spends her days walking from charity shop to charity shop, trawling for bargains. But she also works as a volunteer in a \u0026shyChristian charity shop. She added: “I am really proud of getting a job. It makes me feel like I’ve achieved \u0026shysomething for myself. “I feel I’m not being judged when I’m there. I love my job and I love going in every time. They say I’m a good worker, one of their best and I could get a paid job in the future.”  But Matthews revealed she has now stopped going to church. She said: “People found out who I was and I was getting grief there, people saying, ‘Oh, do you know who that is?’ “I felt uncomfortable and there were kids there as well. I still believe in God, I just don’t go to church now.” Matthews lives in a one-bedroom basement flat with her budgie Bob. She said she is still “terribly lonely” and added: “I talk to Bob when I get home. I feed him from my hand. “I don’t want a man. I don’t trust them. It’s just me and the budgie now.” Because of her time behind bars Matthews said she is uncomfortable indoors. She added: “I hate being trapped. I have to get out.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum left worried after fiance","story":"NewsWorried mum launches search for partner who didn\u0027t come home from bike ride and discovers him dyingLeanne Bale and her teenage daughter Taylor formed a search party when Joe Cannon, 30, didn\u0027t return after taking his new 125cc motorbike out for a late-night spin\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJanet Hughes20:48, 8 MAY 2018Updated23:49, 8 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA worried mum whose husband-to-be didn\u0027t return home from a bike ride stumbled across the scene of the horror crash that killed him. Leanne Bale and her teenage daughter Taylor formed a search party when Joe Cannon didn\u0027t return from a ride out on his new 125cc motorbike - bought so he could start another job. But they came across the scene of a tragic accident. Paramedics spent an hour battling to save the young dad after a heroic witness had tried to perform CPR. Leanna and Joe been inseparable since their first meeting in 2013 and became engaged on Christmas Day when the 30-year-old proposed in their living room. The tragedy unfolded in the village of Drybrook in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, just after midnight on Sunday.  Leanne has paid tribute to the “love of her life” who can never be replaced. “I loved him so, so much, my world will never be the same again,” she told Gloucestershire Live . As well as Leanne, Joe leaves behind their son Jai Jai, who will be two in July. His grieving fiancee said: “I’m not the only one, everybody loved Joe. He was an amazing dad and all the kids loved him because he was a big kid himself. “Everybody warmed to him because he was always helping people out and he made friends wherever he went. “He wasn’t one of those men who are too scared to show his feelings. When Joe loved you, you knew it. He was really soppy. “He loved us and he loved his family to bits. I still can’t believe he’s gone.” Joe had bought the motorbike online on Saturday because the general handyman and labourer was due to start a new job making glamping pods after the bank holiday weekend.  He was excited about the bike but was having problems starting it so took it for a late night test run around the village on Saturday night. When he didn’t come home, Leanne and teenage daughter Taylor went for a walk to see if he had broken down and came across the scene of the accident. As paramedics battled to save him for about an hour, a devastated local woman who had given Joe mouth to mouth until the 999 crews arrived spoke to Leanne, but she could not take in what was being said. “Never in your wildest dreams do you think something so awful could happen,” she said. “I could see the blue flashing lights and I was thinking broken bones and working out what to do because I thought I’d be sitting in A\u0026ampE for hours. “People were talking to me but nothing was going in. I just went numb and went back to wait. Then somebody from the police knocked on the door to say he had gone. Even now I can’t believe it.  “I like to think he was smiling. He hadn’t had a bike for years and was so excited to get one he could not stop smiling all day. “I didn’t want him to go out that night but he was so excited, he wanted to ride it.” Joe was born and brought up in a close-knit loving Mormon family to a school secretary mother. He also leaves a stepfather Jeff and siblings Beth, Nathan, Zac and Matt, who is currently working in New Zealand. The keen sportsman played rugby for the school and Gloucester All Blues RFC. “His mum says he was a cheeky little tyke at school and he grew up to be a cheeky, cheeky man, but he was our cheeky man,” she said. The couple met when Leanne saw an image on social media and commented that his son Tyler, who lives with his “lovely” mother in and stays with the couple weekends, and her daughter Taylor had the same blanket. After a week talking non-stop, nonsense to each other for hours at a time Leanne caught a bus to Gloucester to meet him. It was love at first sight for both of them and they have been together ever since.

A tribunal review today called a Restricted Parking Zone (RPZ) in Coventry city centre unenforceable and added that its signs were confusing. The Traffic Penalty Tribunal ruling upheld six cases but the decision could land the authority with a heavy bill if it impacts the tens of thousands of drivers fined since the zone was set up. Between October 2012 and August 2017 58,536 fines were dished out - equal to about 30 tickets a day.  If all of those drivers fined decide to appeal to the Traffic Penalty Tribunal, and have their appeal upheld the council could be looking at forking out millions of pounds to make things right. If all of the drivers had paid the higher rate of \u0026pound70, the council\u0027s bill could be upwards of four million (\u0026pound4,097,520). Coventry City Council strongly opposes the decision and said it is taking legal advice on a possible challenge. Chief Adjudicator Caroline Sheppard OBE said the information about parking could be easily missed as some of the gateway signs had been placed in unusual locations and also close to signs warning about a change of speed limit. She also said there hardly any repeater signs present during her visit to the city and none in some of the streets where fines had been complained about. She said it would be particularly confusing for visitors coming to the university and those attending tourist attractions in the city centre, she added.

It was approached by a covered bridge, leading down a wide staircase to a spacious booking hall. The broad, sweeping platforms a quarter of a mile long could take 18-coach trains. The waiting room had a cheery coal fire, and there were always porters to help passengers. There were ornate refreshment rooms. Normanton station was a Victorian marvel. And now gone, all gone, except for a short section of platform and a bus-stop shelter for the infrequent stoppers to Leeds. The buildings were demolished, post-Beeching. No more Thames-Clyde expresses, or “all stations to Manchester Victoria”.  The station was once the heart and soul of a community, a place of bustle, business, comings and goings to far-off places. Of romance, even. It was no coincidence that Brief Encounter, that most English of romantic movies, was filmed around a station, Carnforth, where Scots flyers thundered through. Today’s stations are either soulless halts or shopping centres from which trains are reluctantly permitted to depart. They bear testimony to the age of coffee shop chains and fashion boutiques. Perhaps this is what travellers want. A Transport Focus survey makes revamped Birmingham New Street the third-best station in the country – the final triumph of retail over railway. There are dozens of shops selling things I don’t want to buy, but the trains still go from cramped, chilly, underground platforms with nowhere to sit and bewildered passengers milling about trying to find escape routes. Kings Cross in London was the most-liked. It may be an architectural masterpiece, but it’s junk if you are on a journey. Not enough seats, and crowds staring miserably at a monster departure board that barely gives you enough time to catch your train.  Maybe that’s because privatised operators are in cahoots with retailers to keep us herded into the shopping precinct. St Pancras is rated second-best. Have you ever tried getting through the wheelie-suitcase warriors there? Lucky to escape with no more than a bruised shin. And don’t try to find the local services. They are in another place altogether, with fewer shops because commuters don’t have time to buy the chainstore rubbish on sale to Eurostar travellers. Give me an honest-to-goodness station where the trains are more important than “the retail experience”. A station like Grade 1-listed Huddersfield, whose classical facade makes the proudest architectural statement on the system.  It has two pubs, proper boozers with proper beer and railway paintings on the wall and drinkers who look as if they might be going to Newcastle (another great station). And there is a station cat. Stations are – or should be – places of glamour. I like to land in magnificent Bristol Temple Meads knowing I could go to Bodmin, Dawlish, Abergavenny, Ludlow, Haverfordwest or Great Malvern. But not Cardiff, which is not the station of a nation. Or back to bloody New Street. Or Derby – characterless despite a makeover. No, give me the great shambles that is Preston. Or Hull Paragon, which just about manages to retain some of the virtues from which it takes its name. Or Glasgow Central, a real terminus, the end of the line from England - now the only one since the closure of Buchanan Street and St Enoch (the site of a huge shopping centre: an honest transformation, at least).

She was a successful actress with a leading role in one of America\u0027s biggest legal dramas, which is now heading towards its eighth season. But it wasn\u0027t an easy ride to the top for Meghan, and she had to work her way through a number of other roles before getting her big break. She was also told she was not thin enough, not pretty enough and not ethnic enough along the way, which really affected her confidence.  But she proved them wrong and she did it, going on to become a huge star - and she\u0027s understandably extremely proud of her achievments. To celebrate her own success she decided to treat herself to the \u0026pound5,000 Cartier Tank Francaise watch - and had a powerful message engraved on the back to remind her of her achievements.  During an interview with Hello! magazine back in 2015 she explained why the watch means so much to her.   She said: I\u0027ve always coveted the Cartier French Tank watch. When I found out Suits had been picked up for our third season – which, at the time, felt like such a milestone – I totally splurged and bought the two-tone version. She had the back engraved with the message \u0027To M.M. From M.M\u0027. She went on: I plan to give it to my daughter one day. That’s what makes pieces special, the connection you have to them.   Meghan will marry Prince Harry at Windsor Castle on May 19.   It was revealed last week that she won\u0027t have a maid of honour or any grown up bridesmaids.   Her dad Thomas will be walking her down the aisle , but Meghan will travel to the church with her mum Doria.

But CsA has other unwanted side effects so the scientists from Manchester University then sought out another compound – WAY-316606 – which also had the same effect. They found that WAY-316606 was even better at suppressing the SFRP1 protein and didn’t have side effects. The scientists hope the compound could be used to develop a drug to reverse hair loss.

Apart from London cab drivers no one had heard of - or cared about - this dark and damp tube of brick and tiles. All that changed on May Bank holiday weekend in 2008 when the graffiti artist Banksy showed up with an exhibition he called the Cans Festival (yes that\u0027s spray cans not Cannes in the South of France - get it?) A week beforehand the mysterious artist sent a message out to a select group of about 40 like minded \u0027street artists\u0027 from around the world - they needed to be in London to help Banksy and no one was going to turn down an invite from the biggest name in graffitti.  2008 was a big year for London and the world. The iPhone had just been launched - most people were still calling on fat Nokias or even using landlines. While Facebook and Twitter existed user numbers were tiny and Instagram was still two years away. Come September 2008 global stock markets would crash and banks would need billions of our money to bail them out.  As Banksy sent his call to arms Mercy by Duffy was number one in the charts. London had been suffering a knife crime epidemic, the Chinese government had been suppressing democracy protests in Tibet and and Prime Minister Gordon Brown had just seen his Labour Party hammered in the local elections by a Tory party run by David Cameron . His fellow Tory Boris Johnson was hatching a plan to become London Mayor. On 24 April Leake Street was boarded up with a sign warning people to keep out as it was \u0027closed for essential maintenance work\u0027. No one would have suspected the mega-star spray painter was behind the hoardings with a group of fellow artists creating soon-to-be famous, albeit temporary, works of art.  One of those on Banksy\u0027s invite list was Charles Uzzell-Edwards who paints under the name \u0027Pure Evil\u0027. He explained: No one knew what it was but it was coming from Banksy and it was going to be big. Then we got the call to meet at a hotel and everyone was brought into a conference room where we were shown plans of Leake Street and how they planned it would look - everyone was allocated a bit of wall to work on. I went back to my studio to pick up my paint and stencils and before I knew it I was painting with Banksy working a few yards behind me.  It was an extraordinary moment - many great artists from all over the world had come together, looking back I guess it was a seminal moment, whatever that means.  There were the guys from Massive Attack (Robert Del Naja), Blek le Rat, these were huge names and everyone worked through the night - the opening party was quite something.  As Uzzell-Edwards hints at this wasn\u0027t a bunch of kids showing up to make a mess of some walls - this was planned and with permission of the tunnel\u0027s owners, hotel rooms had been booked, security was in place and of course a few words were released to the press the day before it was opened to the public to tempt them in. Banksy said: Graffiti doesn\u0027t always spoil buildings, in fact it\u0027s the only way to improve a lot of them. In a few hours with a couple of hundred cans of paint, I\u0027m hoping we can transform a dark, dirty, neglected hell hole into an oasis of beautiful art.  I\u0027ve always felt anyone with a paint can should have as much say in how our cities look as architects and ad men.  So getting to cover an entire street with graffiti is a dream come true, or as some people might call it — a complete and utter nightmare.  As well as well established artists, Banksy picked a few unknowns to come along - among them was a young Portuguese artist called Alexandre Farto who paints under the tag Vhils. He was living in South London at the time and getting invited to the Cans was a big moment for him - not least he was given a bit of wall to work on right next to where Banksy was making his \u0027Cave Painting\u0027.  As Uzzell-Edwards explained: He pitched up with a jack hammer and a scary expression on his face and everyone was amazed by what he did - no one had seen him before.  A picture of Vhils \u0027Chisel Face\u0027 made the front Page of The Times on the Saturday of the Cans festival. Since then he\u0027s travelled the world carving faces in to walls and his latest collaboration was with the man behind the famous Obama \u0027Hope\u0027 election campaign poster Shepard Fairey.  Come 10am on the Saturday morning, with the festival well promoted in the press, thousands turned up with huge queues to get in.  It really did have a festival feel about it - there were bizarre moments too - Jason Donovan showed up on a moped to have a look around.  At the end of the tunnel an area of \u0027free wall\u0027 was left so anyone with a spray can and some stencils could make their mark. Within days the free wall was covered and most of the art works by the big names had been \u0027improved\u0027 by passers by - it\u0027s what Banksy wanted.  People always like to speculate on Banksy\u0027s identity - is he an individual or a group of people cleverly marketing a movement?

The Hollywood starlet, 36, best known for her role in hit series Suits, has wowed the world while accompanying husband-to-be Prince Harry at events across the globe.  And since their engagement last November, excitement about the royal wedding has rocketed, with the world waiting for any hint of what their big day will hold.  Meghan has already given up her acting career as she prepares to become an official royal, undertaking royal duties and charity work as a full-time job.  But while her life has taken a dramatic aristocratic turn, the brunette-haired beauty has far more humble roots than Prince Harry.   The actress was born to Thomas Markle Jnr and Doria Ragland in 1981, who divorced in 1987 - around 10 years after first meeting.  Meghan has two half siblings, Samantha and Thomas Jnr, who are the children of Thomas Snr from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless. While Meghan\u0027s parents will attend the wedding together and her father will walk her down the aisle, her frosty relationship with her half-siblings mean they will not feature in her big day. Here, we\u0027ve taken a closer look at who Meghan Markle\u0027s family are. Mum - Doria Ragland  Meghan has previously gushed about her \u0027free spirit\u0027 yoga instructor mum, Doria Ragland, who lives in Los Angeles and rocks dreadlocks and a nose ring. We first got a glimpse of Doria at the Invictus Games last October. After 17 months of keeping a low profile while dating, Harry and Meghan stepped out together for their first properly public display of affection - and she brought her mum along. Meghan\u0027s mum is in her early 60s, but her youthful complexion makes her look more like a sister than a mother to Markle. Born in 1956, Doria later became a social worker and yoga instructor in California, and the latter might give us a clue as to how she\u0027s stayed looking more like her daughter\u0027s sister. She gave birth to daughter Meghan in August 1981 and divorced her father Thomas Snr when Meghan was six. The 61-year-old will be playing an important part in the royal wedding, accompanying Meghan in the bridal car on her way to the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle. Dad - Thomas Markle Snr  For months the world eagerly awaited news of whether Meghan\u0027s father would walk her down the aisle. And two weeks ago, it was confirmed the 73-year-old former lighting director would be carrying out this traditional fatherly duty at his daughter\u0027s wedding. He met Meghan\u0027s mum in the late 1970s as a divorcee after separating from his first wife Roslyn Loveless. Thomas Snr already had two children with his first wife, Samantha and Thomas Jnr. Like his actress daughter, Thomas Markle Snr also worked in the world of film, winning awards for his lighting direction. He worked on iconic American shows including Married with Children and General Hospital. In 2011, he won a Daytime Emmy Award for his Outstanding Achievement in Lighting Direction for a Drama Series for his work on General Hospital.  After his career in Hollywood came to an end, he moved to Mexico where he reportedly lives a reclusive lifestyle near Rosarito Beach - according to neighbours. He moved to his new home from LA after declaring himself bankrupt in California with credit card debts of \u0026pound24,180. When Meghan was a child, her father won \u0026pound560,000 in the lottery enabling him to provide her with a great education, according to Thomas Jnr. Thomas Snr will meet the Queen in the days before the wedding, Kensington Palace confirmed. He will spend time with Her Majesty, as well as Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. This meeting of the Royals will also mark the first time he will have met his future son-in-law Harry. Brother - Thomas Markle Jnr  Thomas Markle Jnr shares his moniker with his father, Thomas Snr. He was 14 when Meghan was born after his father met Doria Ragland in the late 1970s. Thomas Jnr then grew up in the same household as his father, sister Samantha, step-mother Doria and half sister Meghan. Now living in Oregon, the window fitter is married to Darlene Blout and has two sons of his own. While the world will watch his father walk Meghan down the aisle on May 19, Thomas Jnr will not attend the Royal wedding. The 51-year-old has reportedly battled alcohol issues in the past and was arrested in 2017 for threatening his wife with a gun. Thomas exclusively spoke to the Daily Mirror about the frosty relationship with Meghan. He said he was left \u0027deeply hurt\u0027 by the royal wedding snub and that fame had changed the American actress. Thomas Jnr said: She’s clearly forgotten her roots. It’s torn my entire family apart. He added: Meg likes to portray herself as a humanitarian, a people’s person and a charitable person but she is none of those things to her family. She is giving the greatest \u0026shyperformance of her life. She is acting phoney. Once she got into Hollywood she turned into a different person.  Samantha Grant, 53, lives in Florida and has three children. During Meghan Markle\u0027s early years, she grew up in the same household, alongside their brother Thomas, father Thomas Snr and her step-mother Doria. Like her brother, Samantha also shares a rocky relationship with Meghan and will not feature in the much-anticipated royal wedding. Samantha has been vocal with her damning opinions of Meghan and her upcoming marriage to Prince Harry. In 2016, the writer and counselor said Meghan\u0027s behaviour was not befitting of a Royal family member after their romance became public. She has also shamelessly admitted her plans to write a reveal-all book about growing up with Meghan.  The book is expected to be called A Tale of Two Sisters, when it is published at a date yet to be revealed. In January, Samantha told the Mirror she had not spoken to Meghan in three years. Despite this, she was eager to receive a Royal wedding invitation, saying It\u0027d be very special to see our father walk Meghan down the aisle on this historic day. Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, have invited 600 people to their wedding and a lunch hosted by the Queen in St George’s Hall, Windsor Castle. Some 200 will remain for a private evening party at Frogmore House in the castle grounds hosted by Prince Charles.

At first the police didn\u0027t want to receive the complaint, because several neighbors gathered in front of the police station, so the complaint has already been made. Several neighbors who saw the situation began to follow him and try to stop him.
