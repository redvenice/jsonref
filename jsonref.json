Why are they called that?Here is everything you need to know…The Empire Windrush arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica (Picture: Getty Images)The Windrush Generation is a term describing the people who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean between 1948 and 1971.It garnered its name from the ship HMT Empire Windrush, a former German troopship acquired as a prize of war, which was the first to carry workers over from Jamaica in 1948.It landed at Tilbury Docks, Essex, in June of that year, carrying 492 passengers and a number of stowaways.Immigrants from Jamaica arrive at Tilbury, London, on board the Empire Windrush in 1948 (Picture: Getty)This was the first in several boat trips over the next two decades, and is not known how many people belong to the Windrush Generation as a whole.People began moving over from the Caribbean after a call from the UK for more workers in industries such as agriculture and mining.In short, they were invited to help the country which was struggling after WWII.The petition is gaining momentum (Picture: parliament.uk)The Windrush Generation is cut off at 1971 as that is when the Immigration Act came in.This allowed Commonwealth citizens already in the country the option to stay indefinitely.Any people yet to move to the UK had to have a work permit and prove that a parent of grandparent was born in the UK.The immigration was poorly documented and the Home Office did not keep accurate records or issue paperwork to those with the right to remain in the UK.Jamaican immigrants welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship HMT ‘Empire Windrush’ landed them at Tilbury (Picture: PA)This has not been a problem for years, but those without documents are now being told that they are necessary if they want to work, use public services or just live in the UK.Penny Mordaunt, International Development Secretary,  said there was ‘absolutely no question’ of the Windrush generation’s right to continue to live and work in the country.‘People should not be concerned about this – they have the right to stay and we should be reassuring them of that,’ she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Barbados high commissioner Guy Hewitt told the BBC: ‘I have held as a great honour the fact that I am the first London-born high commissioner for Barbados.‘This is the first time I have felt that the country of my birth is saying to people of my region “you are no longer welcome”.’Labour has called a public meeting with affected people on April 19, while Prime Minister Theresa May has issued an apology to the Windrush Generation.Meanwhile shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ‘The treatment of the ‘Windrush generation’ of migrants who came from the Caribbean is scandalous.‘Many came here as children, their parents invited to the UK to work. They have been here decades, worked and paid taxes, set down roots and created families of their own. This is their home.‘But the Government is treating them as illegal aliens. They are denied the free NHS care they are entitled to or even threatened with deportation. This must stop.’MP David Lammy described the Windrush scandal as ‘a day of national shame’.MORE: Seven inmates killed after eight-hour riot at prison holding some of America’s worst criminalsMORE: Planet Earth just survived an asteroid sneak attack – but we might not be so lucky the next time"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/pjimage-141.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;crop=1","title":"floss dance created everyone","story":"The floss dance began on Instagram and now everyone is flossing away (Pictures: InstagramITV)Just when you thought you were getting the hang of the dab, a brand new on-trend dance move comes along.It’s called the floss dance, and if you want to be down with the kids you better learn how to do it.Unfortunately, it requires a lot more coordination than the Cha Cha Slide or the Hokey Cokey.

Pictured above are residents overlooking downtown San Francisco as the fire rips through the city          The massive 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck the Northern California coastline, at precisely 5.12am local time on April 18th. Pictured above are people gathered following the quake as the fire continues to burn in the city          Although, the earthquake occurred before the Richter Scale was created, so the magnitude is an estimate. Some experts estimate the large tremor varied from 7.7 to 8.3.

International Mother Earth Day 2018 therefore falls on a Sunday.What is International Mother Earth Day?According to the UN, ‘International Mother Earth Day is celebrated to remind each of us that the Earth and its ecosystems provide us with life and sustenance’.The Day calls for the recognition of our collective responsibility to promote harmony with nature and the Earth ‘to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environmental needs of the present and future generations of humanity’.Harmony with Nature is the UN\u0027s initiative to get people and societies to reconsider their relationship with the Earth and the natural world to improve \u0027the ethical basis of the relationship between humankind\u0027 and our planet.          International Mother Earth Day coincides with another event raising awareness, Earth DayThe UN says the Day should be treated as an opportunity for people to raise public awareness about the challenges surrounding the well-being of the planet and all the life it sustains.In the UN resolution recognising the day, it says member states should acknowledge ‘that the Earth and its ecosystems are our home, and convinced that in order to achieve a just balance among the economic, social, and environmental needs of present and future generations, it is necessary to promote harmony with nature and the Earth’.Last year\u0027s theme was \u0027Environmental Climate Literacy\u0027 - whose aim was to establish a global citizenry that was \u0027fluent in the concepts of climate change and aware of its unprecedented threat to our planet\u0027.                                                    Why is it called International Mother Earth Day?The day is named so because Mother Earth, as it says in the resolution, is ‘a common expression for planet earth in a number of countries and regions, which reflects the interdependence that exists among human beings, other living species and the planet we all inhabit’.How did International Mother Earth Day start?The Day was created in 2009, when the General Assembly wanted to add another dimension  to, and way of achieving the balance between economic, social and environmental needs of current and future generations.Recognising that Earth Day was already celebrated in many countries on the same day, the UN decided to assign April 22 to International Mother Earth Day through resolution ARES63278. International Champions Cup 2018: Fixtures, dates, teams and ticketsJohnny Galecki net worth revealed as Big Bang Theory star returns to RoseanneSouthwest Airlines passenger paid $8 to leave Facebook Live goodbye message on Flight 1380 Pornhub now accepts Verge cryptocurrencyNational Lottery: EuroMillions results for Tuesday, 17th April 2018 Underground radio station set up by son of Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley is pulled off air amid claims of sexual harassment, failing to fairly pay artists and tolerating \u0027homophobic\u0027 remarks Margot Robbie to star in Harley Quinn spinoff movie directed by Cathy YanKim Kardashian \u0027annoyed\u0027 by Kanye West\u0027s Twitter tribute to Lamar OdomInternational Mother Earth Day 2018: Everything you need to know When is Kardashian Family Feud on TV?

But could that simple habit really be turning my life into such a headache?It turns out it could. Bruxism — the medical term for the involuntary clenching and grinding of the teeth, usually during sleep — is soaring. According to the NHS, as many as six million suffer, and the majority are women aged 25 to 44, like me. While it may sound like a minor irritation, it can do an awful lot of damage.Come on, Eileen! This pair of size 14 \u0027granny pants\u0027 almost...Acclaimed Fixer Upper craftsman Clint Harp and wife Kelly...Share this articleThe jaw is the strongest muscle in the body. Normal chewing puts between 20lb and 40lb of pressure on your teeth, but grinding or clenching can exert a force equivalent to an astonishing 300lb.It’s enough pressure to crack a walnut shell — and teeth-grinders can be doing it for as much as 40 minutes of every hour they’re asleep.          According to my boyfriend, who had to contend with me making an awful gnashing noise in my sleep, I did. But could that simple habit really be turning my life into such a headache? (pictured: Lara King)No wonder it can take its toll on teeth, wearing them down and causing them to crack, break or become more sensitive.It’s also not uncommon for problems to surface in the neck, shoulders and back as the jaw muscles become so tight that pain is referred to other parts of the body.Teeth-grinding can even be behind a range of symptoms as varied as vertigo and hearing loss, by triggering inflammation in the inner-ear muscles.It can ruin your looks, too. ‘If someone grinds a lot you can sometimes see it in their face, because the muscles increase in size from overwork,’ says Dr Uchenna Okoye, aesthetic dentist and director at London Smiling Dental Group.‘It’s like building up your biceps with weights. You end up with more muscle mass in the face and jaw.’The result can be a square face, bulging hamster cheeks or ‘lantern jaw’ — a long, thin jaw with a prominent chin.          Dr Shivani Patel, of Elleven Dental in London, tells me there’s a strong genetic element (thanks for that, Mum) but that stress is usually the triggerA British Medical Journal study also found that a loss of lower facial height due to teeth wearing down can make you appear as much as 20 years older.With all of that to worry about, it’s a wonder we ever sleep at all.So what causes teeth-grinding? The experts are agreed: stress.Dr Shivani Patel, of Elleven Dental in London, tells me there’s a strong genetic element (thanks for that, Mum) but that stress is usually the trigger. Dr Patel’s practice has seen cases of bruxism rocket by 30 per cent in five years as our lives become increasingly high-pressured.Most of her patients are women, but Dr Patel has also started treating children as young as 11.She says: ‘When some people are stressed they break out in spots, or get rashes or stomach upsets. Others grind their teeth.’If you think a glass of wine before bed will relax you, think again. Not only does alcohol reduce deep sleep, making grinding more likely, but Andrew Eder, a professor at the UCL Eastman Dental Institute, says that acidic drinks such as prosecco and white wine soften enamel so it’s more easily worn away through grinding.For me, two-and-a-half years after that rather painful lunch, teeth-grinding is a nightly battle that has left me with a fissure in one tooth, a clicky jaw and bouts of neck stiffness, headaches and jaw pain.And while the experts say that a spell of stress is likely to have triggered my grinding in the first place, they also warn that once it starts, it can become habitual. When I visit Dr Patel, she tells me that it’s left a line of dentine (hard, dense, bony tissue) visible on the edges of my top and bottom teeth — showing that I’ve worn away the enamel.Enamel can’t be replaced, and losing it raises the risk of cavities, decay and infection. I take good care of my teeth and pride myself on having no fillings, so it’s infuriating that something I’m doing when I’m sound asleep is damaging them.Still, it seems I’m one of the luckier ones. Emily Mason’s grinding was so severe she destroyed one tooth entirely and had to endure a root canal treatment.Emily, a 37-year-old communications consultant from Wokingham in Berkshire discovered she was grinding her teeth three years ago. ‘I had a lot of pain in what seemed to be every single one of my teeth,’ she says. ‘My entire mouth was aching constantly. I felt like I was going mad, because I just couldn’t get to the bottom of what was causing it.’Her husband Chris, 36, hadn’t noticed Emily was grinding her teeth, but her dentist eventually spotted the signs. In an attempt to stop it, Emily had three of her molars filed down, as her dentist suggested it would make her bite more even and let all of her teeth take the force of the grinding, rather than just one or two. But it wasn’t enough.‘Things came to a head last year when I had to have a root canal.‘I had clamped my teeth so hard together on such a regular basis that I had stopped the blood supply to a tooth. I was mortified that I’d allowed the situation to get to that point.’Emily admits she’s a ‘natural worrier’, but says: ‘I’m not sure what triggered it. I work full-time and have two young sons — Archie, seven, and four-year-old Rufus — and I don’t live near my family, which means the school run, helping at Beaver Scout group and generally being a taxi service all falls to me.‘But that’s nothing out of the ordinary for most mums.’In an attempt to break the cycle, she is now having her teeth straightened at a cost of £3,500.‘My dentist told me many of his patients who have done this notice they’re clenching less,’ she explains.‘If the alignment isn’t perfect, people may grind and clench their teeth trying to find a comfortable way for the upper and lower teeth to sit together.’Her Invisalign braces — clear plastic aligners that sit snugly over the teeth — will also offer her some protection.‘They will create a barrier and stop my teeth from hitting one another when I do grind,’ says Emily.Mouthguards worn at night are most dentists’ first course of action — but they can do more harm than good. Experts warn that the soft plastic variety that can be bought over the counter actually encourage grinding by inducing a chewing response.Dr Okoye recommends patients have a hard ‘splint’ mouthguard custom-made at a cost of up to £1,000. But even at that price, it won’t last for ever.‘The hardest substance in the human body is enamel, and if that’s ground away there’s no manmade thing I can replace it with that you won’t chomp away at, too,’ admits Dr Okoye.And while guards shield the teeth from damage, they can’t stop the grinding action, so a guard won’t necessarily alleviate the other symptoms.In desperation, more and more women are turning to radical treatments — including Botox. Tracey Jones, 49, a personal assistant, has spent at least £3,000 over the past five years on chiropractors and physiotherapists to try to relieve agonising pain in her back, neck and shoulders.Two years ago, her dentist diagnosed bruxism and said it was likely she’d been grinding for over a decade. He gave Tracey, from Cheshire, a mouthguard, but she says it didn’t stop the muscles clenching.Tracey, who is married with two grown-up daughters, is now trying Botox. More commonly used to smooth away wrinkles, the chemical is injected into the skin where it partially paralyses muscles. The theory is that injecting it into the muscles in the jaw reduces their activity.‘I had the treatment in September,’ Tracey says. ‘It took just five minutes and the effects last up to six months — although it takes ten days to start working.‘Each session costs £550, but today I estimate that I’m 85 per cent better than I was before.‘I’m sleeping through the night without interruption and when I wake up I’m no longer in pain.‘Fortunately it hasn’t affected my ability to chew or eat as it affects a different set of muscles.’But experts are ided on the safety of Botox for teeth-grinding, pointing to evidence that it may eat away at the jawbone.Our bones constantly regenerate, and rely on impact and muscle movement to produce new bone cells. When the jaw muscle’s activity is reduced by Botox, it can’t push and pull the jaw as powerfully, hampering the process.One study suggests a single treatment could trigger a loss of bone density of as much as 40 per cent, increasing the risk of teeth becoming loose or even falling out.So how can you tell if you’re grinding? Professor Eder says to ask your dentist to look for the tell-tale signs: ‘You’ll normally see a white horizontal line inside the cheeks, just adjacent to where the teeth meet, in people who are actively grinding.‘You may also see indentations on either side of the tongue.‘Eventually, worn teeth can become more sensitive, get sharp at the edges, chip and become shorter.’ Ultimately, the question remains: How do we stop something that we’re doing while we’re asleep?Perhaps part of the answer is not worrying about it too much. Dr Okoye says: ‘We used to try to cure people of teeth-grinding, but we now realise we can’t. It’s para-sympathetic, meaning it’s unconscious and involuntary — like breathing, or your heart beating.‘Instead, what we can do is protect the teeth with a mouthguard and give people tools to change their behaviour by learning to manage their stress. These can be as simple as sticking Post-It notes around your house saying “relax”.‘Many patients won’t realise how tense they are until they see that sign and consciously loosen up.‘Everyone wants some sexy, difficult treatment. But it really is just a case of stress management and creating an awareness of how important it is to relax.’As for me, I’ve decided to see if a mouthguard can help put an end to my waking nightmare — and to try not to let the daily grind wear me (and my teeth) down any longer."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/02/4B43AB7E00000578-5626379-image-a-28_1524015341720.jpg","title":"Pictured Hero pilot safely landed Southwest flight","story":"Tammie Jo Shults (pictured left, and right on the aircraft with the rest of the crew), a former Navy fighter pilot and the first woman to fly an F-18, quickly brought the Dallas-bound Southwest Flight 1380 to land at Philadelphia International at 11.30am after the explosion at 32,000ft. Asked if the plane was on fire, she said: \u0027No, it\u0027s not on fire but part of it\u0027s missing.

There was momentary chaos. Everyone kind of descended on where this hole was.

No slides were deployed.\u0027 It has given no further comment on the injured woman or what caused the engine to explode.  When the shrapnel pierced the window, it depressurized the cabin and triggered the oxygen masks. Despite the chaos in the air, others said the emergency landing was fairly calm and smooth.           One of the plane\u0027s engines exploded not long after it had left LaGuardia Airport in New York City on Tuesday morning.

The closer we got to the ground, I realised something was really wrong.\u0027The chute had gotten tangled and choked her instructor, who passed out.

Tree pollens tend to be most active from March to May and weed pollens from early spring to early autumn.Symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes.                                                     DEFRA guidance for high air pollution said: \u0027Adults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, should reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors.\u0027People with asthma may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often.\u0027Older people should also reduce physical exertion.\u0027Anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors.\u0027Around 29,000 Britons are killed annually by air pollution - 15 times more than the 2,000 who die in road accidents - Department of Health-backed research shows.With temperatures expected to hit a scorching 80F, the bookies have slashed the odds into just 14 that Thursday notches up the highest temperature of 2018. And the scissors have also been taken to the price that a whopping 86F (30C) is reached (64) anywhere in UK.

It is the world\u0027s largest operator of the 737. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.The National Transportation Safety Board says a preliminary examination of the blown jet engine  shows evidence of \u0027metal fatigue.\u0027In a late night news conference, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said one of the engine\u0027s fan blades was separated and missing. Sumwalt says the blade was separated at the point where it would come into the hub and there was evidence of metal fatigue. He said part of the engine covering was found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles west of Philadelphia. Horrific accident caught on camera leaves three deadPrecious moment gorilla kisses her baby seconds after birthGermaine Greer predicts Meghan Markle will leave Harry8-year-old girl raped and murdered a wedding in IndiaBattered boyfriend Alex Skeel tells of his mental torture\u0027The mouth is for eating\u0027: Uganda\u0027s president warns against oral sexGeorgia woman attacks pregnant soldier at restaurant and gets arrestedTerrifying moment surfer is mauled by four-metre great white sharkTwo surfers have been mauled by great white shark just hours apartDrug smugglers caught at Heathrow trying to move £16m of cocaineAlfie Evans\u0027s father front row of Pope\u0027s weekly general audienceJewish man is whipped with a belt in anti-Semitic attack in BerlinSouthwest CEO Gary Kelly said in Dallas that there were no problems with the plane or its engine when it was inspected Sunday.The jet\u0027s CFM56-7B engines were made by CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines of France. CFM said in a statement that the CFM56-7B has had \u0027an outstanding safety and reliability record\u0027 since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aircraft worldwide.Last year, the engine maker and the Federal Aviation Administration instructed airlines to make ultrasonic inspections of the fan blades of engines like those on the Southwest jet. The FAA said the move was prompted by a report of a fan blade failing and hurling debris. But it was unclear whether the particular engine that failed on Tuesday was covered by the directives.\u0027There\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0027 said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. \u0027In this case it didn\u0027t. That\u0027s going to be a big focal point for the NTSB - why didn\u0027t (the ring) do its job?\u0027In 2016, a Southwest Boeing 737-700 blew an engine as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida, and shrapnel tore a 5-by-16-inch hole just above the wing.

When will the industry tackle its failings?The year is 1971. In London, Robert Morris’s Tate show, Bodyspacemotionthings closes after four days because viewers, encouraged to climb over its adventure playground-style structure, have become too boisterous. In New York, the Whitney Museum faces a huge backlash for appointing a white curator for its Contemporary Black Artists in America exhibition. Meanwhile, Linda Nochlin’s essay Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists is published to the delight of campaigning feminists everywhere. She argues not that women artists aren’t great, but that their greatness has been overshadowed and ignored by a canon comprised almost entirely of men. Its publication is a watershed moment, one that shakes the lofty and complacent art world to its core. Forty-seven years later, much has changed. Female curators are now commonplace within national museums and galleries the head of the Tate is a woman, Maria Balshaw and there is a much greater awareness of the way women artists have been marginalised over the years. However, there is one aspect of visual arts that remains overwhelmingly male (and white): criticism. As Jerry Saltz, megawatt showman for New York magazine, receives his deserved Pulitzer win for his art criticism, it is worth taking note of the absence of female art critics who are similarly feted. Despite numerous female winners of the Pulitzer prize for criticism specialising in architecture, TV, fashion or film, the last – female art critic to win was Manuela Hoelterhoff of the Wall Street Journal, back in 1983. Since then, little has happened to dislodge the notion that men are the cultural gatekeepers. From John Ruskin’s enthusiasm for JMW Turner to Robert Hughes championing Lucian Freud, male art critics have been invested almost exclusively with the power to make or break entire artistic movements, shaping the cultural legacy of generations and deciding whose work is worth celebrating – and collecting in museums. So where are the women? Rosalind Krauss, Lucy Lippard and Griselda Pollock, all feminist art writers well known in their fields, largely write for academic and specialist titles rather than the mainstream press. At the other end of the spectrum, young UK-based art critics Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad are dedicated to making art criticism accessible and ersifying the structures of the arts industry. They make the case for a new brand of art criticism, as concerned with Love Island as it is the White Cube’s latest offering, and their success without the patronage of the mainstream press is laudable. But it speaks volumes about the kind of voices national titles are willing to give status to. Meanwhile the lead art critics for the Sunday Times, the Washington Post, the Independent, the Telegraph and the Guardian are all male. Laura Cumming at the Observer, Rachel Campbell-Johnston in the Times and Roberta Smith, co-chief art critic at the New York Times, are rare examples of female critics given a broadsheet platform. It’s not as though the visual arts industry is devoid of women – in fact statistics point towards a gender disparity in the opposite direction: arts, design and history graduates are overwhelmingly female. Yet the art press is still a boys’ club.  The problem must lie in an arts and media landscape that sees men as the voices of authority. Feminist art collectives the Guerrilla Girls and Pussy Galore, and art theorist Hito Steyerl have all attested to an art world still in the heavy grip of patriarchy. Like a bad rash, the effects of the arts industry’s problem with unpaid labour are catching. With the majority of unpaid work being taken up by women, is it any wonder that they are turning away from a career in arts criticism for more stable work elsewhere? Add to this the reduction of space for arts criticism in many newspapers, and common microaggressions like mistaking female journalists for PR assistants, and the circles of access for women art critics get smaller and smaller. Despite important work by people such as Taylor Renee Aldridge and Jessica Lynne – who have highlighted the significant lack of black art critics – the issues have been ignored, erted and at worst, forgotten. Unwelcoming and certainly not inclusive, it points at an art press seriously out of touch with the modern world.At a time when barriers in other branches of the arts are being dismantled – from Kendrick Lamar winning a Pulitzer to Beyoncé’s historic headlining set at Coachella – the art world is lagging badly behind. It’s about time arts criticism began to assess its failings. In the harsh light of a year dominated by the revelations of the #MeToo movement, Nochlin’s legacy remains a troubling reminder of the work that still needs to be done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a991fd62798f90eb6935fb361c442e3aa221d94/0_0_1600_1042/master/1600.jpg?w=1500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e08ca9ac8f963ace794ecfee304613dc 3000w","title":"the last town in sovietland vorkuta russia tomeu coll in pictures","story":"Up above the Arctic Circle, 40 hours by train from Moscow, sits the Russian city of Vorkuta.

Research suggests that new ideas and solutions to problems often arise when our minds are not focused on a particular task, but running in the high-connectivity state recently identified as the “default network”. Yet in an\u0026nbspage of smartphones, social media and other electronic crack-pipes, it is all\u0026nbsptoo easy to keep focusing on one trivial thing after another, and so never allow the brain enough of this fecund time. There is, then, some scientific basis to the increasing advice for us to unplug, at least partially, which is becoming formalised within a young discipline with the nice name of “ecopsychology”. Just as ecology aims to bolster bioersity in physical spaces, ecopsychology aims to help us keep our minds fertile terrain for the green shoots of constructive thinking.That is one of the lessons of this elegant and interesting book, which adopts the commercial form of the “smart thinking” airport manual but works with ideas at a higher level. Leonard Mlodinow is a theoretical physicist who has also worked as a writer on Star Trek, so he is obviously annoyingly good at the kind of boundary-hopping cognition he champions. “Elastic thinking” is the name he gives to the way new and creative ideas pop up into the conscious mind in moments of insight. It is contrasted with “analytic thinking”, which is our rule-led, logical, conscious thought. Other writers (such as Malcolm Gladwell) have rhetorically downgraded analytical thinking in order to champion the elastic or “intuitive” kind, but as Mlodinow emphasises, you need both. Elastic thinking generates a lot of rubbish as well as a few gems the job of analytic thinking is to sift for the diamonds in the rough and then polish them. A new scientific idea, for instance, is generated through elastic thinking, but then must be tested and worked out fully with the analytic mind.The problem, as the author sees it, is finding the right balance. A purely logical reasoning style is not creative a purely elastic one is all over the shop. But most people could do with a larger proportion of elastic thinking. Hence the advice to manage one’s info-consumption according to the precepts of ecopsychology. Particularly in the modern world, Mlodinow argues, we need more of elastic thinking’s “capacity to let go of comfortable ideas and become accustomed to ambiguity and contradiction”.This is not exactly a new recommendation, being very like what John Keats called “negative capability”. But Keats did not have a brain scanner, and the results of modern investigations suggest some useful new tips. It turns out that we might approach problems more creatively if our executive, conscious brain is exhausted from having focused on\u0026nbsplots of boring choices: so a few hours doing your accounts might help you write a better sonnet afterwards. Alternatively, if you find the world to be a\u0026nbspfuzzy place in the mornings due to sleep inertia, which Mlodinow charmingly admits is true of him (“in my morning stupor I have done things like crack an egg into the sink and then start to fry the shell”), you will do your best writing soon after waking up.The book is packed with other insights, puzzles and philosophical interludes – about how we often follow “scripts” in our social behaviour, rather like video game characters about how thinking itself is a bodily pleasure, something that is too rarely remarked on and about the authentic “intellectual beauty” that can be appreciated even in ideas that turn out to be wrong. Mlodinow notes that we have been able to program computers to emulate analytic thinking in very specific domains (such as chess), but elastic thinking is something no artificial system has ever demonstrated, regardless of any PR jargon about “deep learning” and the like. If you want to create a general problem-solving brain, he concludes happily, “the best way is still to find a mate and create a new human being”.There is no shortage of popular books making exaggerated claims about science’s understanding of\u0026nbspcreative thinking – including the now-notorious Imagine by Jonah Lehrer, which invented Bob Dylan quotes – but as a scientist himself, Mlodinow is laudably careful not to overstate his case. (“It is an oversimplification,” he warns for example, “to chalk up anything as complex as a personality trait to\u0026nbspa single gene.”) His book, while nodding to the business market, is refreshingly free of the curious moralising that often accompanies such how-to guides, which conflate imaginative thought with being a healthy 21st-century citizen-employee in all the approved productivity-enhancing ways. Not many other authors will advise the reader to try getting drunk – or, better, totally baked – if they have a tough problem to solve. It even turns out that procrastination helps, in which case I am sorry, because this review might have been better if I’d missed my deadline. • Elastic: Flexible Thinking in a Constantly Changing World is published by Publisher.

Seven other people were injured. The pilots of the twin-engine Boeing 737, travelling from New York to Dallas with 149 people onboard, were widely praised for showing “nerves of steel” after they took the plane into a rapid descent and made a successful emergency landing in Philadelphia.  Passengers said oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling and they were instructed to brace for impact, leaving some in tears, while others shouted encouragement. In a recording of conversations between the cockpit and air traffic controllers, the captain, Tammie Jo Shults, reported that there was a hole in the plane and “someone went out”.A passenger, Alfred Tumlinson, from Corpus Christi, Texas, said a man in a cowboy hat had rushed forward a few rows to grab Riordan and pull her back in. “She was out of the plane. He couldn’t do it by himself, so another gentleman came over and helped to get her back in the plane, and they got her,” he said.Images of the plane on the tarmac showed a missing window and damage to the left engine, including part of its cover. A piece of the engine covering was later found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles west of Philadelphia, the National Transportation Safety Board said.The NTSB said a preliminary examination of the engine showed evidence of metal fatigue. A full investigation is expected to take 12 to 15 months. The last passenger death on a US commercial flight was in 2009.David Gleave, an aviation safety investigator based at Loughborough University described the incident as a “completely freak event”, caused by an unlikely series of coincidences, each of which would have to be examined in detail. “Why did the engine fail? Why did the engine fall apart? And why did the blade get thrown forward out of the engine and hit a window? It’s an unfortunate series of things, but that’s what we need to get to the bottom of,” he said.Gleave said the engine’s metal cowling, or cover, should have prevented any parts flying out. Design flaws, manufacturing or maintenance issues were all possible explanations for what happened, he said.Passengers said Shults walked through the aisle and talked with them to make sure they were OK after the plane had touched down. “She has nerves of steel,” said Tumlinson. “That lady, I applaud her. I’m going to send her a Christmas card, I’m going to tell you that, with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.”The US transport secretary, Elaine Chao, said the pilot, crew and others onboard had prevented a greater tragedy. Shults was among the first female fighter pilots in the US military, according to friends and the alumni group at her alma mater, MidAmerica Nazarene University.Amanda Bourman, a passenger from New York, said everyone had started shouting to brace for impact when the plane prepared to land. “I just remember holding my husband’s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed. And the thoughts that were going through my head, of course, were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again.”She said she was seated near the back of the plane asleep, when she heard a loud noise and oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. Bourman said the plane was fairly quiet because everyone was wearing a mask but added: “You had a few passengers that were very strong and they kept yelling to people, you know: ‘It’s OK, we’re going to do this’.”The airline said in a statement that the fatality was the first of its kind inSouthwest’s 51-year history and extended its sympathy to all those affected.Gary Kelly, Southwest’s chief executive, said there were no problems with the plane or its engine when had been inspected on Sunday. Nevertheless, the airline announced on Tuesday night that it would inspect similar engines in its fleet over the next 30 days as a precaution.A Southwest Boeing 737-700 blew an engine in 2016 as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida, and shrapnel tore a 5-by-16 inch (12-by-40cm) hole just above the wing. The plane landed safely. The NTSB said a fan blade had broken off, apparently because of metal fatigue.Gleave said the cause of the 2016 incident was still to be fully determined, but now that it had reoccurred there was greater urgency to do so because there were 2,000 737s in the air at any one time.Riordan, from New Mexico, was the vice-president for community relations at Wells Fargo bank, working with non-profit groups. The Albuquerque mayor, Tim Keller, said the city had “lost a thoughtful leader who has long been part of the fabric of our community”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d84d11d6ae9f47546f64d57ee8dcfba2e39f968b/0_201_5393_3236/master/5393.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e7720d98596a44ecf16a1390edfdb1c1 1240w","title":"act jamaica deported british england home office","story":"I was 27 when I was deported from the UK to Jamaica, so I am not a Windrush migrant – but my great grandparents were.

But I was “illegal”, and so I couldn’t work or pursue my education, and it was incredibly difficult.Things weren’t easy for either of us. My mum didn’t have her right to stay, and had to work cleaning public toilets and doing whatever her boss told her. I remember she used to cry all the time, especially when it was cold, and we had hardly money to buy food. We’d turn the house upside down just to find enough coins to buy a large chips and wings, and then we’d share it, happy at least to be together.When I was 19, I was living with a friend, and she fell into debt arrears and was threatened with eviction. We needed money to keep a roof over our heads, and agreed to collect some drugs for some guys. The police raided us on arrival and I was arrested.Of course, I regret it. That offence made it much harder for me to fix my stay. I know there are people who will say I’m a “foreign criminal”, but what does it mean to call me “foreign”? I never felt like “a migrant”. I was just trying to build a life in the place I called home, and deportation has been the worst punishment imaginable.I was exiled from my mum, my partner, and my stepkids. I left my friends, my memories and my home. I was forced on to a charter flight in the middle of the night, denied all appeal rights, and sent to a country I did not know. Jamaica is not my home. Jamaica is where I am a foreigner.I remember reading the Coming Home to Jamaica booklet in detention. The immigration officers and detention staff try to paint a rosy picture of Jamaica: they tell you about these organisations that will help you they say there’ll be people waiting for you at the airport that these organisations will help you with financial support until you get a job. These are false hopes, these are lies, but sometimes they are all detainees have.I just found the booklet frightening. It told me to “travel where possible in the day”, to “keep my cash and personal items hidden from view” and to “try to find lodgings in areas that are considered safe”. It told me not to “walk around after dark in unfamiliar places”, not to “discuss my personal situation with people I was not familiar with” and not to “allow strangers to know my destination”. It definitely did not make me feel like I was “coming home”.But the piece of advice that was hardest to swallow was this: “Try to be ‘Jamaican’ – use local accents and dialect (overseas accents can attract unwanted attention)”.How was I supposed to “be Jamaican”? I had not set foot on the island since I was a child. Who was going to help me learn to be Jamaican? My mum and my support network were in England. “Try to be Jamaican.” They don’t know how hard that is.When I came back, I felt this kind of embarrassment: a stigma. As a deported person you feel small people stare at you. People don’t understand you and laugh at your “proper English”. When you go to buy things, they can tell that you’re “foreign”, and all of a sudden the price doubles.So maybe their advice wasn’t that bad after all. But it’s hard to “be Jamaican” when you speak in a Brummie accent with a twist of cockney.I stand out. I walk into places I don’t know and people shout: “Foreigner, let me sell you something.” So yes, overseas accents do attract unwanted attention, but what am I supposed to do about it? One thing is for sure, being sent from the UK to Jamaica was not “coming home”.I’ve been back for over a year now, and I still can’t handle the heat.My mum got sick immediately after I was deported. First she became severely depressed and started to blame herself for not being able to do more for me. Not long after, they discovered she had lung cancer. It happened so quickly. The day they shut her life support machine off, the electricity had gone from our district and the mobile networks were down. My family tried to call me to let me say my goodbye but I was robbed of that chance. I have been robbed of so much.In September 2017, one year after I was deported, I buried my mother in Jamaica. Maybe she was “coming home”, but this island is not mine. My home and my memories are in England. I try to be positive but I can’t follow the advice of that booklet. It is impossible for me to “be Jamaican”. I am British, and even deportation can’t change that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/832a539d471bd5f7042f32752b3171c6c5316f34/0_131_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9dca786004a4423f4cf76d5c10617bfd 1240w","title":"first human on mars should be woman","story":"What do the names Kalpana Chawla, Mae Jemison, Valentina Tereshkova and Sally Ride mean to you? Until fairly recently, the names of these female space pioneers didn’t mean much to me. Despite being obsessed with all things space as a six-year-old girl, who thought a day out at the Jodrell Bank Observatory was as exciting as a trip to Disney World, I was never taught about them. I didn’t know that Dr (!) Tereshkova was the first woman to fly into space, that she was 26 when she went, and that when she took off she said, “Hey, sky! Take off your hat, I’m coming!” Nor did I know that Dr Chawla was the first Indian-born woman to go into space and that after she died in the Columbia disaster they named a hill on Mars after her.A senior Nasa engineer, Allison McIntyre, said this week that the first person on Mars should be a woman. And she’s right, because despite the incredible work of many female scientists and engineers involved in space exploration, there has historically been a “space gap”.Nasa is light years away from where it started: in 2016, it selected its first gender-balanced cohort of astronauts and it has a number of outreach programmes geared towards inspiring girls. We are also starting to see the traditional under-appreciation of women’s role in space being addressed in wider culture, from films such as Hidden Figures, which tells the story of the three female Nasa “human computers” working in the 1950s-60s, to the women featured in books such as Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls and A Galaxy of Her Own.But Nasa being one-third female isn’t good enough, and women still face barriers when it comes to representation in science, technology, engineering and maths. They face biases both explicit and unconscious, which can affect them throughout their careers, impacting whether they get research grants and lab space. There is a clear gender gap that opens up at age 16 before then, equal numbers of boys and girls study sciences. This gap gets wider the further up you go – we make up only a small proportion of professors. There is much that can be done about this, such as peer-reviewing hiring decisions, but the pace of change is agonisingly slow.A woman being the first person on Mars would not solve all this. But what a statement for Nasa to make. The gravity of it makes my head spin. Perhaps it is a failure of imagination on my part but the feeling of watching a woman become the first human to walk on Mars … I can’t imagine how it would make me and millions of other women and girls feel. How does it feel to watch a person of your gender set foot on a faraway celestial body for the first time? Could you write to me, men, and let me know?And while it wouldn’t make up for all the gender injustice in the world, it would be a damn good start. It would make a statement to the planet – not to mention possible life on other planets – that women are as deserving of stardust as men. I know I shouldn’t get my hopes up after all, look at what happened with Hillary Clinton. But nonetheless, this is my plea to Nasa: make a woman the first human in history to set foot on Mars. For six-year-old me. For all of us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2655dee1ddb9dcc4a31d914fb0313d190a815a9/0_95_4024_2415/master/4024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=34793f825841e79ebbf7db8b0df7c79f 1240w","title":"political platitudes have masked cruel policies time to stop swallowing them","story":"Rightwing politicians spout rhetoric with which no reasonable person would disagree, while we wait for a catastrophic injustice to expose the realityThe politics of the platitude – the statement with which no reasonable person could disagree – has been dominant for at least the past 20 years. Who doesn’t want zero hunger? Who thinks education is bad? Who doesn’t want clean and sustainable energy or responsible, pro-social businesses? Who wants poverty entrenched, children from poor families to have no aspirations, opportunities for only some, inequality to thrive and some people to be treated as worth less than others?The language became so anodyne and meaningless that we had to look for the sense of it in the cracks, in the things that went unsaid. What did “lacking aspiration” really mean? Did it mean a person didn’t want a good life, or just that they weren’t middle-class enough? How was it that all unfortunate circumstances were driven by their hapless or feckless victims, and there were never any other factors? Why, when everybody was against inequality and for human rights, did equality get further away, and “human rights” become the new “red tape”, amorphous, troublesome, indistinct, someone else’s idea?In tandem with the new discourse, where everybody wanted the same thing – better, less impoverished lives for all – and all that was left was for decent people to choose between a suite of practical options, the actual decisions meted out by politics have become cruel. The “hostile environment” for which Theresa May is rightly castigated today has become the norm not just for immigrants, but for everyone who falls short of what the “decent citizen” of her conception should be. Anyone economically unproductive, unless they are old anyone insufficiently healthy, unless they are in the Paralympics anyone who doesn’t belong here, a category whose dimensions have become theoretically limitless, now that the criterion for belonging is that you can prove you belong, yet the Home Office holds the proof and is liable to destroy it at any moment, for “data protection”. It transpires – who knew? – that not every stamp of politics does want the best for everyone. Being unable, under the 21st century’s Convention on What’s Normal, to admit to not wanting the best, instead rightwing politics has reconfigured what it means by “everyone”.There’s historical precedent, sure, for conservative politicians not saying what they mean. Margaret Thatcher famously wanted to solve her disputes in the industrial heartlands by just putting a wall around Liverpool and leaving them to it. Even though this view was pretty well understood at the time, it took the release of historical cabinet papers before anyone could stick it on her. But the new element, the shiny modern bit of our predicament, is the sluggishness: we’re aways waiting for the hostile environment to explode into human tragedy, for a man to be refused cancer treatment, for a woman to be deported, for a hunger strike, for a suicide, always waiting for a catastrophic injustice to have a face, before we can say “this is unjust”. It’s not a collective amnesia, where we have forgotten what justice looks like, or a sudden, generalised lack of sincerity or compassion. It’s just a logical consequence there’s no space to argue about principle, because everyone claims to believe the same thing. So we wait and see what it looks like in practice. This has the pleasing scientific veneer of an evidence base, but is destructive to the lives capsized in the process. We need to stop buying it: stop swallowing the rhetoric with which no reasonable person would disagree. Then we might see the meanings beneath it in time to halt the consequences rather than bemoan them.“Am I being unreasonable?”, asked a woman posting on Mumsnet. That would have been the moment to look away. The answer is always either: “No, that’s fine, though it’s quite unreasonable that you wasted my time by asking,” or: “Unreasonable doesn’t even begin to cover it, you are so boilingly unhinged that someone should tattoo you with a warning sign or stripe you yellow and black like a bee.” But I had got as far as the subject line, whence there is no escape, like a spell invented by Tolkien.A mother of three was complaining that her husband, having started a job, had announced he needed “full personal assistance” in the morning. I assumed it was a sex thing, but no: he needed his keys and his wallet laid out, and his shoes and suit neatly arranged, unless he was cycling, in which case he wanted them in a bag, but she wouldn’t be informed of his method of transport until such time as she’d already done the other thing. Responses ided three ways: “If my husband said this, I would laugh in his face” “I used to have a husband like this, then I left him and my current husband is much nicer” and “How disappointing, I thought this was going to be a sex thing.”The outrage was superb – I want to say comradely or supportive, but no, it was just so vividly enjoyable. If someone had suggested forging the man’s Brompton into stocks and setting him there in a town square, I would have been in. Any one of us would have been. Which all made me feel a little sorry for the great villains of the internet age, the Zuckerbergs, the Russians trolls, the many facilitators of a social rage that previously didn’t exist. It’s not that the internet is making us angry. It’s just the place that you go when only anger will do, as the corner shop is to the strawberry bonbon.The Queen’s corgi, Willow, passed away this week aged 14, survived by two dachshund-corgi crosses that are probably called dawgies, full name: Inspector Dawgie.

Didn’t you love Willow?” is the unspoken followup unless it’s a yes, in which case: “So soon? How could you?” “How long, realistically, do you think you’re going to live?” hovers in the background, along with: “Do you trust any of your children to adopt a young pet, and if not, why not?” Safer, always, to go off on a tangent: taxidermy chinchillas tact lies in unexpected places at this difficult time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a9b690112242bc82cd5ed2c0ebeef9b3a6829c4/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6809dddd5603791618955e6c82afa89d 1240w","title":"starbucks misguided racism workshops","story":"The line between implicit bias and explicit bias can become murky at times, but the Starbucks incident is a clear case of explicit bias and to call it anything less is outrageousAfter a Starbucks manager had two black men arrested for occupying a table without making a purchase, Starbucks has announced their plan to conduct racial implicit bias workshops for all their employees amid the growing protest.Implicit bias, a term drawn from psychology, has become a new buzzword in the media that refers to the unconscious attitudes and stereotypes held by iniduals around certain groups of people. Often people can act on implicit bias in prejudicial and discriminatory ways without even realizing it, such as assuming a black man is less qualified for a job than a white man, despite having similar résumés and skill sets.While the line between implicit bias and explicit bias can become murky at times, the Starbucks incident is a clear case of explicit bias and to call it anything less is outrageous. To consciously pick up the phone to call the police on two black men sitting at a table doing nothing is an explicit act.What is more concerning than how this incident is being represented to the masses is the willingness of non-profits and social justice organizations to discuss overt discriminatory incidents through the lens of implicit bias. Implicit bias frames offer these organizations an ability to discuss race in a disarming, nonthreatening means because the idea is implicit bias affects everyone’s minds unconsciously and no one is safe from its grasp.There is some validity to this argument. However, the concerning part is when implicit bias workshops – which rely heavily on social psychology to understand and overcome our brain’s unconscious racial biases and stereotyping – are offered in place to mask explicit and structural bias qualifiers that form racial violence and attitudes. As such, implicit bias workshops have become nothing more than a neoliberal PR stunt for both corporations attempting to avoid legal liability, and race organizations seeking to be solutions and funding-oriented. It’s an easy out when genuine solutions to racial violence are much more complex, time-consuming and expensive.In the Starbucks case, consider that Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), has been brought on as one of the “experts” to develop the implicit bias workshop curriculum. The ADL is a staunch supporter of Israel and advocates against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which calls for an end to Palestinian occupation. How ironic is it that ADL is involved in a racial bias workshop while supporting Israel’s policing and oppression of Palestinian people?Additionally, the ADL has sponsored exchange programs that allow Israel’s military to provide training to US law enforcement officers. During a time when Black Lives Matter is galvanizing against the militarization of police and an end to police brutality against black and brown bodies, this is a grave oversight. These are the politically charged structural-level issues implicit bias work is deflecting from. Because it makes people uncomfortable.The ways by which neoliberalism has co-opted social justice work is not new though. Most recently, Cornel West called out Ta-Nehisi Coates for being the “neoliberal face of the black freedom struggle”. Coates’ contribution to mainstreaming the black narrative is undeniable. Yet West has very valid critiques of Coates’s work that apply to the emerging implicit bias field as well. West underscores “any analysis or vision of the world that omits the centrality of Wall Street power, US military policies and the complex dynamics of class, gender and sexuality in black America is too narrow and dangerously misleading”. This is where implicit bias workshops fall short – in both analysis and vision.There is a place for recognizing the critical role of implicit bias in racial disparities it’s just not here. Bottom line – don’t be too quick to label Starbucks’ racial implicit bias trainings a victory. It’s far from it. The process for change is uncomfortable and if it’s not, then it’s probably not working."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ccc227688b4527a344250d8b7c6498691f5bd1f/106_610_3198_1918/master/3198.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=afcc4acaa0aec1a295099a14775b0123 1240w","title":"british girl wins gold medal at international maths competition","story":"Emily Beatty from King Edward VII school in Sheffield came joint-first among 200 teenagersA 17-year-old Briton has won a gold medal in an international mathematics competition, becoming the first UK entrant to achieve full marks. Emily Beatty, who attends King Edward VII school in Sheffield, came joint-first among nearly 200 teenagers who took part. She was one of only five competitors to get a perfect score of 42 out of 42.The British team finished third of 52 in the European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad, which took place in Florence, Italy.Her teammates Alevtina Studenikina, from Cheltenham Ladies college in Gloucestershire, and Naomi Wei, from City of London Girls’ school, won silver medals for their scores. Melissa Quail, from Longsands academy in Cambridgeshire, won a bronze medal.The team was chosen by the UK Mathematics Trust (UKMT), a charity set up to advance young people’s education in maths.Speaking the day before the competition, Beatty and her teammates explained why they loved the subject. Beatty said she has always found “elegance in doing mathematics” and that she likes the way “structures weave into each other”. Studenikina said: “I find Olympiad-style mathematics questions interesting because, even though they do not necessarily seem to have useful applications, principles and skills obtained from solving them help solve real-life problems.”Quail said she enjoyed solving maths problems as they allowed her the freedom to use her imagination and creativity.Speaking to the Times Education Supplement, Beatty’s maths teacher, Graham Harvey, said that older pupils could be good role models for young mathematicians.“Probably the biggest impact on Emily was from one of our former students, another girl, currently at Cambridge studying maths,” he said. “We have always encouraged our older students to help us run clubs for the younger ones. Emily herself is currently mentoring one of our year 10 students. We also have a significant number of female maths teachers in the department.”Linda Gooden, the headteacher at King Edward VII school, said: “As a headteacher, I alongside all the other staff in school are really proud of Emily’s success and achievements. We always encourage staff to develop and enhance depth of mathematical understanding from an early age. We are really pleased with Emily’s achievements and know her parents will be proud too.”Rachel Greenhalgh, the director of the UK Mathematics Trust, said: “The team demonstrated their outstanding problem-solving skills and it is great to see their mathematical potential recognised.“I thank all those involved, from the maths teachers who support our activities and the UKMT volunteers who run them on our behalf, to our sponsors and supporters, in helping make this possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b88cca3c973ed7bfe5d3eea9a4505e45d0550d/0_29_886_532/master/886.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b9e10b7fa5d255f6f7533440dd3fdaea 1240w","title":"balkan dam projects could result in loss of one in 10 european fish species","story":"Exclusive: Plans for a network of hydropower plants in three countries would cause ‘chain reaction’ for endangered species, report warnsNearly one in 10 of Europe’s fish species will be pushed to the brink of extinction by a constellation of hydropower plants planned in the western Balkans, new research has found.Eleven endemic species would be wiped out, seven more would be critically endangered, four types of sturgeon would be devastated and the number of endangered species would double to 24, according to the University of Graz report.Prof Steven Weiss, the paper’s author, told the Guardian: “It is the largest systematic construction plan with negative environmental impacts that I know of, since world war two.”Weiss said: “The high density of what is being planned affects everything in the region. It transforms whole river systems into a series of reservoirs that need to be flushed. It breaks up migration corridors, and drains and isolates wetlands that have a dramatic effect on birds. There is a whole chain reaction.”The 11 fish populations most at risk are: Cobitis jadovaensis Alburnus vistonicus Delminichthys jadovensis Delminichthys krbavensis Phoxinellus dalmaticus Telestes polylepis Telestes turskyi Telestes ukliva Knipowitschia mrakovcici Eudontomyzon hellenicus and Zingel balcanicus.These are all endemic to the Balkans, Europe’s most important bioersity hotspot for molluscs and fish.One EU official told the Guardian that the study “should give us pause for thought. It’s clearly not possible for everyone’s plan to be built. Otherwise, you’re just pouring concrete over the entire region.”RiverWatch, the conservation group which co-commissioned the research, estimates that 2,800 hydropower plants are planned or under construction in the region, more than a third of them on Natura 2000 sites.Just three pristine waterways – the Neretva basin, Morača and the upper Drina system – alone host around 50 endangered and protected fish species.The countries through which they flow – Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro - are all investing in hydro, in a bid to meet the EU’s clean energy targets before joining the bloc, even though research suggests that hydropower annually emits as much methane as Canada.“This is one of the very painful activities we have to go through,” the EU source said. “These countries have plans for hydro to align with the EU’s rules on renewable energy but it is a sad state of affairs. The alternative for a number of them is not solar or wind, but coal and particularly, lignite.”The EU’s leverage over countries not yet in the bloc was limited to offering guidelines on standards, although technical assistance for environmental protection might also be considered, the official added.Ulrich Eichelmann, Riverwatch’s chief executive, said: “This report proves that Balkan rivers are the fish paradise of Europe. At the same time it is unbelievable that in the 21st century, hydro investors and politicians are risking this enormous natural value for something they call ‘green’ energy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6199c2342bf2024a7310dc1b94705df9fac0e99/0_190_3120_1871/master/3120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1bfcb2e6fc7a0e12d3926507e20cd7e3 1240w","title":"grease review john travolta olivia newton john","story":"Rereleased on its 40th anniversary, the nostalgic rock’n’roll high school musical remains a sugar-rush of a film‘What happened to the Danny Zuko I knew at the beach?” With this stunned and plaintive cry, Olivia Newton-John introduces the main theme and narrative dynamic of this still very enjoyable 1978 movie based on the original stage musical, which is now on rerelease.Newton John plays Sandy, and she’d met such a sweet boy over the summer, enjoying a more-or-less platonic beachside romance and imagining she would never see him again once she went back to Australia. But her family’s plans changed and, with the new term, Sandy shows up at the local high school and is astonished to see Danny, played by John Travolta. Compelled to be super-cool in front of his gang buddies, he is crudely dismissive of Sandy, but secretly still in love with her.We hear the classic split-point-of-view song Summer Nights, in which Sandy regales her saucer-eyed friends with Danny’s gallantry and Danny jeeringly implies he’d had his way with her on the sand. The movie is all about male identity, peer pressure, sex in that pre-pill era and innocently imagined rock’n’roll. Grease was also about race: the title had overtones of “greaseball”. Blond Sandy is as Waspy as they come Danny and some of his gang are regarded as outsiders partly because of their Italian American ethnicity – and the same goes for Rizzo, as tough as any boy, played by Stockard Channing.Grease broke John Travolta through to family audiences who might have been chary about his more adult movie sensation, Saturday Night Fever, the year before. It was part of the 70s fashion for 50s nostalgia that also had its expression in George Lucas’s American Graffiti and Garry Marshall’s longrunning TV show Happy Days, and survived in the form of Robert Zemeckis’s Back to the Future in 1985. Travolta’s effortless dancing here is different from his lithe and narcotically sexy disco performances in Saturday Night Fever. In Grease it is more family-friendly. Still superb, less about pelvic grinding than about the quiff, elbows and the knees rotating in 45-degree shunts, as if he were appearing in an Egyptian frieze. It’s still a sugar-rush of a film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893007c8bb46b312892379b7b423a8052de7f3ce/0_617_5669_3400/master/5669.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e500e47dd3b549b867f70fe1e845546b 1240w","title":"mercury 13 space women nasa 1960s","story":"In a new Netflix documentary, the tales of 13 female pilots who dreamed of becoming astronauts yet were denied the opportunity by Nasa are finally brought to lightBut what if that one small step had been taken by a woman? What kind of leap would that have represented, at a time when the American public was waking up to women’s rights?That’s the focus of Mercury 13, a Netflix documentary that explores the fates of 13 female pilots who were prevented from entering Nasa’s space training program.The women featured in the film passed through some of the same physiological and psychological testing procedures as Nasa’s first male astronauts, as the space race with Russia ramped up in the early 1960s. In some cases, the women, each of them skilled flyers, fared better than their male counterparts, but their testing, which was designed to assess their suitability for space flight, was conducted with private funding without the approval of Nasa.As the women prepared to undergo further testing, which would have included flying jet planes – previously the province of men – Nasa refused to extend the project. The women’s dreams were shattered, and it would be more than two decades before an American woman made it into space.After the release of Hidden Figures in 2016, which told the story of three black women who struggled for acceptance at Nasa during the space race, Mercury 13 offers a further glimpse into the difficulty women faced in breaking into the field.“I think it’s important to tell people that women were involved in the space program. There’s lots of films about the space program and lots of stories about the space program but they generally focus on men,” said Heather Walsh, who co-directed Mercury 13 with David Sington.“So I think it’s good to draw out these stories and show that women might not have been talked about but they were there, and they did help, and they did draw their bit.”The film follows the story of the 13 women and their legal battle before Congress in 1962, arguing that they were prevented from further space testing and training on sexual discrimination grounds.Their case captured the imagination of the American public, but was rejected by President Johnson. It was a missed opportunity. Russia sent the first woman – Valentina Tereshkova – into space in 1963, winning a propaganda battle that the US could have otherwise claimed.Walsh believes there would have been greater implications than just a propaganda victory, had the US backed the Mercury 13 women.“I think everything would have changed. I think there would have been a female president by now,” she said. “Being an astronaut at that time was the pinnacle of what you could do. You know, the whole world was watching. And when you step out on to the moon there wasn’t a person on the planet that didn’t want to see you and didn’t know who you were.“And I think if that person was a woman it would have would have changed things. It would have seemed normal for women to do anything.”Mercury 13 interviews Wally Funk, Rhea Woltman, Sarah Ratley and Gene Nora Jessen, each of the women participated in space-readiness testing conducted by Dr William Randy Lovelace, who had helped develop the physical and psychological examinations used to select the first team of astronauts for the Nasa training program. Named Project Mercury, it was America’s first human spaceflight program, and would see Alan Shepard become the first American in space in 1962.Lovelace was close friends with Jacqueline Cochran, whose pilot skills had propelled her to fame in the 1930s. Cochran had set women’s national speed records was involved in setting up establishing Women Airforce Service Pilots, who performed non-combat flying missions during the second world war.Cochran and Lovelace felt women had a role to play in space. Outside his contract with Nasa, Lovelace began a private screening program, conducting the same tests he had devised for men on female pilots.Jerrie Cobb, who later became a staunch advocate for female flyers, was the first to undergo space testing, but faced resistance in the media. Mercury 13 shows one clip from a television interview in the early 1960s that particularly illustrates the opposition the women faced. In the interview Cobb is quizzed as to why “there is a need” for women in space.She answered: “Well it’s the same thing as is there a need for men in space. I mean, if we’re going to send a human being into space we should send the one most qualified. And in certain areas women have to offer in other areas men do. I think we ought to use both.”Sington, who previously directed In the Shadow of the Moon, a documentary about manned US missions to the moon, said he and Walsh had originally hoped to bring Hillary Clinton’s success in the 2016 election into the film.Clinton has often told a story about writing to Nasa as a teenager, asking how she could become an astronaut. She said she received a letter back “saying they weren’t accepting women”, and Sington said contrasting that experience with her subsequent presidency would have provided an uplifting ending.Clearly, that didn’t happen.We’ll never know if Walsh is correct – and if we would have had a female president by now had a woman been the first to walk on the moon. Even if the Mercury 13 had passed the aptitude tests, they might still have been rejected – perhaps Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin would still have proved more able, and the first person on the moon would still have been a man.But as Cobb told her skeptical interviewer in the 1960s: women should have been given the opportunity to try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93e6a80eed58b1c5b845f1f1643f9d51b925efe9/0_281_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f9ec498d1cd6a958dd344e2bd1eef0f4 1240w","title":"joey barton fleetwood head coach betting ban","story":"Joey Barton will take over as head coach of Fleetwood Town on 2 June, when his suspension for breaking Football Association betting rules expires.It will be the controversial former England midfielder’s first job in management.

Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah, currently leading the Premier League scoring chart on 30 goals, accompanies Agüero and Tottenham’s Harry Kane, who has scored 26 league goals, in that attacking line-up. Only the goalkeeper David de Gea was named from United, while fourth-placed Tottenham boast three selections in Kane, playmaker Christian Eriksen and central defender Jan Verthongen. Completing the line-up, and despite last season’s champions’ disappointing title defence, Chelsea left-back Marcos Alonso was named in a team he failed to make last year when losing out to Tottenham’s Danny Rose. Alonso held off strong competition from left-backs such as Liverpool’s Andy Robertson and Tottenham’s Ben Davies.On Sunday, the overall winner of the PFA Player of the Year award will be unveiled, with De Bruyne, De Gea, Kane, Silva and Salah all nominated, along with City winger Leroy Sané, surprisingly omitted from the Team of the Year.Wolves will be playing Premier League football next season after securing promotion, and have three players in the PFA’s Championship team of the year.

I am strongly attracted to a friend with whom I work. We meet up once a year and work together for several weeks across the summer. The rest of the year, I’m in another country.Last summer I told him I was attracted to him, and his reaction was initially one of joy and surprise. Moments later his attitude changed and he started to talk about his “issues”. Over the next few weeks, he distanced himself from me. We did have one good talk, during which he said he was worried about detrimental effects on his mental health if things didn’t work out. I get strong signals that he would be very interested, except for this fear holding him back.Since separating our work has required us to remain in email contact. Besides work emails, I have sent several personal emails in which I have told him in detail about how I feel about him and how much I value and admire him, in the hope that it will give him some reassurance. I’ve not had much response, other than a brief thank you in acknowledgement, to these.I am in a quandary about what to do when we meet up again this summer. I flip between thinking I will keep my distance and let it go, and thinking I will push things a little further. But I am very worried that pushing things further may constitute harassment.You say you get “strong signals that he would be very interested except for this fear holding him back”, but the signals that you’ve described here are, alas, not that. You told your friend that you were attracted to him in person and he told you that he didn’t want to be in a relationship with you. You told him again, over email, how you felt about him, and you’ve “not had much response”.I’m sorry to say that I don’t think that your friend wants to date you. Who knows why not? It may be the “issues” he professes. It may be something else altogether, but the bottom line is that it’s not your job to persuade him otherwise.That’s not to say I don’t understand your desire to encourage him to feel otherwise! You mentioned that his initial reaction to you confessing your feelings was joyful, and it’s natural to wish that you could help him get back to that feeling. But what I learned from my own experience with ambivalent men (and oh my, I have known quite a few ambivalent men) is that the key to a successful relationship is two people wanting to be in a relationship. You can be kind and you can be encouraging, but you can’t make someone want to be with you by persistence and force of will.Will trying again to persuade your friend constitute harassment? I think it could be viewed as unwanted behaviour. Imagine if the gender roles were reversed: in this post-#MeToo world, a man who asks a female colleague out repeatedly after she says no would be seen as a creep. Even if he did not make a formal complaint if you “push things a little further”, your continued pursuit after your friend gave you a pretty clear no may make him uncomfortable, and have a negative effect on your experience working together. That would be a shame, since you clearly care about your friend and your work.Please don’t lose heart, or at least not too much. That you’ve written to ask me this question and that you don’t want to step over the line shows that you are a thoughtful and caring person. I’m certain that you will meet someone who you adore who will adore you back without caveat or condition or hesitation: someone who, like you, is ready, not afraid. I teach English as a foreign language and I’ve always been a bit wary about relationships related to work – both with colleagues and students (adult students, obviously). Although I’m relaxed about being friends with adult students outside of the classroom, I’ve always personally carried the idea that dating students is something that shouldn’t happen.However, I’ve met other teachers who’ve ended up in great romantic relationships with students (often after they’ve stopped being their teacher) and who now have happy marriages. I’m curious to know what you and others think, especially as it could potentially be an issue for me in the future.You gut feeling is correct: you should not date your students, even if they are adult students. The student-teacher relationship is inherently imbalanced in favour of the teacher’s authority, even if the student pursues the teacher, rather than vice versa. (Jo Livingstone wrote very well about this in the New Republic.) Your no dating students rule is right because it respects the reason that your students are spending time with you: to learn. A classroom is not a singles bar. I would also say that if a teacher is standing in front of a classroom of adult ESL students and thinking about which one of them is most attractive, rather than how to help them learn English, the teacher is … not really doing their job?Drawing the line at dating students also eliminates risks: that your relationship with one student might have a negative impact on your other students, your ability to do your job or your employer’s perception of your motivation and performance. These are all things that you’ll put on the line if you date a student, even if the relationship itself is True Love.Once someone is no longer studying under you, I think you can feel free to ask them out – when they’re not your student, but your peer. But maybe wait until they’ve been out of your classroom for a few days before you make your move, lest this give your employers the impression that you’ve been counting the days until the end of term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e599f0ed1653c2f22ecf85d34a6b1bb14672a7f/168_284_2358_1415/master/2358.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=aeb9abd2341731bfb1b2bd1bbb8363b2 1240w","title":"jeremy hunt investigated breach money laundering rules luxury flats","story":"Parliament watchdog confirms inquiry over failure to declare stake in companyJeremy Hunt is being investigated by parliament’s watchdog after admitting breaching money laundering rules.The health secretary was forced to apologise for failing to declare his part ownership of a company, which bought seven luxury flats in Southampton.Kathryn Stone, parliament’s commissioner for standards, received a complaint about Hunt on Friday. The commissioner’s website confirms that Hunt is now under investigation.According to the MPs’ code of conduct, “members shall fulfil conscientiously the requirements of the House in respect of the registration of interests in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests”.When the registration documents were filed in September 2017 only Hunt’s wife was named, constituting a breach of regulations.Guardian inquiries established that the flats were developed by a property company owned by a Conservative donor.The 82-flat luxury block was developed by Nicolas James Group, a south coast property company owned and chaired by businessman and Conservative donor Nicolas James Roach.Roach has made more than £50,000 in donations to Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency office since 2011, mostly in the form of the complimentary venue hire.Hunt and Roach were pictured together in 2011 at a party to launch a £60m hotel partly developed by Roachs’ company in Guildford, which is in Hunt’s Surrey constituency.A spokeswoman for Hunt said last week: “The owner of the development is a long-standing acquaintance. Jeremy paid standard market rates which would have been available to anyone else making an equivalent purchase.”According to the property giant Savills, each flat in the development is worth between £450,000 and £1m.The spokeswoman blamed Hunt’s accountant for mistakes in the Companies House’ documents. “These were honest administrative mistakes, which have already been rectified,” she said. “Jeremy’s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight.“With respect to ministerial and parliamentary declarations, the Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2019fced7d93af14d85ce6216f74d9ada8979306/0_14_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=53318337177f31f19695436b134fdcf6 1240w","title":"ministers to announce brexit climbdown as they face lords defeat","story":"Government braces for series of amendments including over customs union as withdrawal bill goes through upper houseThe government is preparing a climbdown over its key Brexit bill in the House of Lords over EU rules on clinical trials, as it braces itself for a series of defeats.Ministers are expected to accept the substance of an amendment tabled by crossbench peer Lord Patel, which would keep EU clinical trial regulations – which have not yet come into force – in UK law.The rules are aimed at streamlining clinical trials across the EU, allowing drugs firms to submit a single cross-EU application – and making it easier for pharmaceutical companies to conduct cross-border trials.A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union (DexEU) said the concession underlined the government’s willingness to accept changes to the complex bill as it makes its way through parliament.“We have always said we are open to listen to expertise, be it from peers or MPs, and if we think the bill can be improved, we will move to do so. That will be the approach through the whole process.”The EU withdrawal bill transfers EU law on to the UK statute book in preparation for Brexit – and grants the government sweeping powers to tweak it in the process.It reaches its report stage in the Lords on Wednesday, with the government expected to lose at least two votes: on a customs union, and future changes to protections such as workers’ rights and environmental law.Nine senior Conservatives, including two former Cabinet ministers, have put their name to various cross-party amendments.One deemed likely to succeed on Wednesday – because it has crossbench, Labour and LibDem support – was tabled by Lord Kerr, who drafted article 50, the formal process for leaving the EU.The amendment would commit the government to report to parliament “outlining the steps” it had taken, to secure “an arrangement which enables the UK to continue participating in a customs union with the European Union”.The DexEU spokesman stressed that even if the amendment were accepted, it would not keep the UK in a customs union, which is not government policy.But opposition peers hope that if the government sustains a hefty defeat, it could strengthen the hand of pro-customs union Conservative MPs, who have said they plan to force the issue in the Commons.Once the Lords has amended the bill, it will be returned to the House of Commons, which will decide whether to accept the changes, or refer them back to peers, in a process known as “ping pong”.The prime minister has postponed crucial votes on other Brexit bills, on customs and trade, to delay a confrontation over the issue of remaining in a customs union, which is now Labour’s preferred policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165a0be666ccb34b84f859b73929a5036fa1e704/0_34_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fe4006717b0e89dfda4ae6f17cb7b2b5 1240w","title":"ed smith ecb england new selector in frame","story":"Ed Smith is expected to be named as England’s new national selector by the England and Wales Cricket Board, with Andy Flower also understood to be in contention.Smith, the former England batsman who has been working as a pundit since retiring in 2008, is the front runner for the role after James Whitaker stepped down last month. Smith and Flower have both been interviewed for the position along with the former England players Mike Selvey and Derek Pringle, with the ECB poised to confirm its appointment this week.The move comes as part of a major shake-up of England’s selection process, instigated by Andrew Strauss, the director of England cricket, which will also involve Fraser and Mick Newell – directors of cricket at Middlesex and Nottinghamshire respectively – leaving their positions on the three-man panel. Instead, a new independent selector will appointed by the new national selector with the England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, remaining on the panel.Ashley Giles turned down an approach to succeed Whitaker this month while the Lions head coach Flower, who coached England between 2009 and 2014 before becoming the ECB’s technical director of elite coaching, retains a strong relationship with Strauss but is not expected to be given the role.Meanwhile, Australia have rejected speculation linking Justin Langer with the vacant head coach role, insisting an appointment has yet to be decided. Reports on Wednesday suggested Langer was close to being named successor to Darren Lehmann, who stood down in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last month.A Cricket Australia spokesperson said: “The process to be undertaken for the appointment of a new Australian men’s head coach will be discussed and agreed at the CA board meeting this Friday.“No appointment has been made, and nor will any candidate be put to the board for ratification on Friday.

It’s the only way we can compete at the highest level against the best in the world – by taking risks.”Pryce believes a solution would be in ensuring the previous generation of elite British halves remain in the game and working closely with clubs – something he believes is reaping rewards at the Super League leaders, St\u0026nbspHelens.“The likes of Lee Briers, Sean Long and Paul Cooke were all coached by the players themselves – and they learned by making mistakes,” Pryce said. “We’re blessed with a crop of highly promising youngsters right now. Players like Jack Walker and Danny Richardson look like absolutely phenomenal talents.“If they keep going down this path, they could easily be the answer – but a lot of what they’ll do is down to what they’re taught day-to-day. Richardson has the blessing of working alongside Sean every single day in training at St\u0026nbspHelens, so it’s no surprise to me he’s being talked up as a great half-back in the making.“Is a way to help by ensuring every club has a specific halves coach who’s played the game so they get proper tuition? Maybe. I’d love to see a way that the powers that be ensured people like Lee and Sean, as well as many others, aren’t lost to the game, because what they can bring to the table is vital for us as a sport and our hopes of winning major trophies at the highest level.”Pryce also feels the British game has to look at the Australians for answers as to how the issue could be resolved. “There’s a formula in rugby league that seemingly works, and it’s about completion rates and always taking the safe options. I’m not knocking any particular coach or any specific club, but if you go to Australia you’ll see that the half-backs are taught to play a completely different way down there.“We’ve continuously matched the Australians in the forwards for the last 15 years but it’s in the half-backs – and I include myself in that – where we fall short. The likes of Johnathan Thurston, Darren Lockyer and Andrew Johns have all been able to dissect a game with the skills and risks they’re encouraged to try from a young age.to pull apart the way young half-backs do things on video – it’s all very stop-start and if you make the smallest mistake it’s seen. I do genuinely worry that you’re coaching the genius and the ability out of these kids.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c34991e4cd9f4f17332ff36d37fc9164eb43d2/0_120_3481_2089/master/3481.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a4cdbfd8a0f39fc706af47e4a8d93609 1720w","title":"peter sagan pope cyclist cycling paris roubaix interview","story":"Sagan is the most popular rider in cycling today and, with the murky uncertainty surrounding Chris Froome and Team Sky, his victory felt like a shaft of light which revealed panache and grit. They call Paris-Roubaix the ‘Hell of the North’, because its 29 cobbled sections have a bone-juddering impact on even the toughest and most brilliant riders. It is also the glittering peak among the five monuments which are cycling’s oldest and most prestigious one-day races.This year the severity of the challenge was underlined by the death of the young Belgian cyclist Michael Goolaerts, who suffered a cardiac arrest. For just under six hours Sagan was in a battle and his feat was accentuated by the fact he broke for glory a startling 53km from the finish. The Swiss cyclist Silvan Dillier clung to a narrow lead as they entered the velodrome, but Sagan was imperious in the final 100m.“Twice I didn’t finish Roubaix,” Sagan says, “and in those races I did finish I was in much worse condition than this year. If you’re fighting for first position your emotions are very different. I was not thinking: ‘This is the hell of the north.’ But you realise one, two, three days later how tired you are. Especially the first morning, I was so tired when I woke up from shaking on the cobblestones.”Sagan sinks into the couch in a Maastricht hotel. We’re a week past Paris-Roubaix and it’s the day before he finishes fourth in the Amstel Gold Race – a 261km ride featuring 35 serious climbs – and the toll is obvious. Yet he is much more involved than he had been in a stilted press conference preceding our interview. As the routine questions from the Dutch press corps arrived slowly, Sagan quipped: “Is this a funeral?”Here, in a more relaxed setting, it seems appropriate to consider Sagan’s remarkable rise from obscurity in Slovakia to becoming the world’s premier sprint cyclist and star of the peloton. The 28-year-old, who rides for the German team Bora-Hansgrohe, became the first reigning world champion to win Paris-Roubaix since Bernard Hinault in 1981. This second classic, after Sagan won Flanders in 2016, sits alongside other milestones. Last year only a controversial disqualification, after Mark Cavendish fell heavily in a bunch sprint, ended Sagan’s run of five successive Tour de France points victories in the green jersey. He then won a third consecutive world championship in Norway.After that victory Bradley Wiggins tweeted, of Sagan: “Cycling’s saviour! This man is currently bigger than the sport, look after him. Congrats Peter, a true legend and one of the all-time greats!” This\u0026nbspgushing reaction mirrors the online response whenever Sagan pulls a giddy stunt – as in 2015 when he was John Travolta to his wife Katarina’s Olivia Newton-John and they acted out the fairground scene from Grease.Sagan reaches an audience which might not know the difference between the cobbled hell of Paris‑Roubaix and the hilly agony of Liège-Bastogne-Liège. Yet Sagan can also be crass and, after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, he pinched the behind of a podium girl.It feels apt to linger over Roubaix. Sagan’s instinctive daring meant he accelerated away early from his main rivals and hunted down the breakaway riders. “It wasn’t planned. It just happened. I started to believe this year could be the year so I told Silvan Dillier: ‘We must work together because behind us are strong guys. If you stick with me there’s a chance for you.’”Afterwards, Dillier said evocatively: “Sagan is an angel and a devil in the same person – an angel because he took me with him and a devil because I had to go man‑to‑man with him.”Sagan nods. “A race is a race and at the end you take it.”He pauses when reminded of Goolaerts’ fate. “I didn’t know him personally. But it’s a shame and I’m very sorry. I don’t know exactly what happened but I don’t think we can blame the sport.”His victory was watched by his father and the emotion they shared sparked memories of their humble Slovakian past, in the town of Zilina, a world away from cycling’s heartlands. “My parents met at a restaurant where they worked as waiters,” Sagan explains. “After some time my father opened a small supermarket. It was still one of the bigger ones in our city. Lots of people came to us and we were also selling beer in tanks. But after they opened big supermarkets in Zilina – like Tesco and Carrefour – in two years my parents’ business was gone completely. My father opened a pizzeria next but they had to work very hard.”When I mention seeing people chortling at his internet escapades he smiles. “Oh yeah? That’s a pleasure for me. I’m happy.”There are moments when Sagan reminds me of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. He is capable of outrageous brilliance, amusing arrogance and sly wit – even if Sagan is a much more measured talker. He still once described himself as an artist. Sagan\u0026nbspnods and points to a bland painting behind us.“For me art is not just a picture like this. Art can take many forms – even in sport. Look at motocross where they do triple back-flips in the mud and land without any issues. That’s art because the rider is doing something impossible for other\u0026nbsppeople.”Sagan might be an artist on his bike but does he feel a responsibility to improve cycling’s battered image? “If you ask me how could I help cycling I would say by being myself. I want to make people enjoy life – because so many people have a hard time. Maybe some of the videos are a little ridiculous, like I’m a clown, but it’s fun. The Grease thing with my wife was my idea. I tried to be good.”I am curious to know what Sagan thinks of Froome. Should the four‑times Tour de France winner be\u0026nbspallowed to race while his lawyers try to clear his name after he was found to have twice the permitted amount of Salbutamol at the Vuelta\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspEspaña last year?Sagan starts to answer but his team’s media officer, an otherwise genial man who accompanies him, interrupts. It is team policy not to comment on the affairs of other riders. I try again and ask Sagan directly. “It’s not my responsibility to discuss this,” he replies.What about the grey area of TUEs – therapeutic use exemptions – as Froome insists his doctor advised him to use his inhaler more when his asthma deteriorated? Sagan shrugs. “If somebody’s sick then\u0026nbsp…”It is, however, an important area as Team Sky have been castigated in a parliamentary hearing for their use of TUEs and Wiggins, another British winner of the Tour de France, has been implicated. “I don’t worry about this,” Sagan stonewalls.Some cycling fans are worried about motors being hidden on bikes but, for Sagan: “If somebody has not been proved guilty then what do you\u0026nbspsay?”Sagan is amused when I ask about his infamous bum-pinching moment on the Flanders podium five years ago. “That was young Peter,” he laughs, raising his hands in guilt. “But she reacted really well and thanks to her for understanding. She did not turn it into a serious problem. But it was a difficult time. I thought: ‘What’s going to happen?”Why did he do it? “Maybe it’s my personality. I don’t know. I was happy I came second and I had my friends around the podium. One of them said, spontaneously, ‘Just touch her thigh or ass’, and I said: ‘Yeah!’ I didn’t think about the consequences. But you have to respect people – otherwise it’s anarchy.”Six months ago Sagan became a father. “Marlon is healthy. He’s laughing, he’s a good boy,” he says of his son. “It’s too early to speak about whether there’s been any change in my perspective because he’s still very small.”As his fame grows so Sagan’s world expands and in January he met the pope. “I was very happy to bring my mother to see the pope. It was her present. I also gave the pope his personal bicycle which was specially made for him. It’s not every day you shake hands with the pope.”Sagan is not the saviour of cycling. He is just an ordinary man, with an extraordinary talent, and so he smiles. “I think being the pope is much harder than being a cyclist,” he says. “I’m not the superhero. I’m not saving people’s lives. I’m just a sportsman. It’s something I’m doing for myself and if people enjoy it then I’m happy.”"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

Her single-minded determination is a subject that comes up again and again when talking to her close – and very passionate – family and friends about her rollercoaster career.After an injury five years ago, Perri had to learn to walk again and switch disciplines from hurdles to sprinting. And this month, despite doctors and physiotherapists setting her chances of a full recovery at around zero, she’s competing as a member of Team England in the 400m and 4x400m relay at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia.“She wasn’t so focused at first,” says Chris Zah, her trainer for the past 18 years. “When we started working together, I made her do everything from 60m sprinting to cross-county. She hated it, and didn’t see the point. As a kid from east London, she really wasn’t keen on mud.”Perri’s outlook changed in 2007, after coming second in the 400m hurdles at the European Athletics Under-20 Championships.“She grabbed me and said: ‘What are we going to do about this then?’” Chris says. “From then on, we agreed to think outside the box. I’d watch her competitors and say: ‘This girl gets to the first hurdle in 6.2 seconds, so you’ve got to get there in 6.1.’ She’d reply: ‘Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.’”This attitude, along with her natural talent, pushed Perri to the world No 2 spot in women’s hurdles. But in 2013, she suffered a torn ligament and cartilage damage in her left knee at the finals of the World Championships in Moscow, leaving her unable to walk. “It’s when you’re at your fastest that your body is most likely to break down, and I’d just won two gold medals,” Perri says. “I tried to stay positive, but I went to some dark places.”Her family, along with Chris, rallied round to encourage Perri not to give up, even on her lowest days. “I used to be so frightened, I could only watch her run by peeping between my fingers,” says Perri’s mum, Norma. “I’d get so nervous – like it was me on that starting line. I’d tell her to run like she could see me at the finish line with my arms open. So when she got injured, it was a terrible time – I can’t put it into words. There were a lot of tears. It’s amazing to think how far she’s come since she was sitting on the sofa with her leg up, recovering.”Norma is speaking from LA, where she’s helping niece Jodie celebrate her 30th birthday. The pair’s enthusiasm for talking about Perri, who they call “the CEO of the family”, sees them scrambling to finish each other’s sentences.“We grew up together, so she’s more like my sister than a cousin,” Jodie says of Perri. “When she got injured I dragged her out to parties on her crutches. I told her it could be worse, that she’d bounce back. Now, she’s better and stronger than ever, and she amazes me every day.”Part of Perri’s fierce determination is a legacy from her father, Patrick, who for 14 years was one of boxer Lennox Lewis’s fitness trainers. “She’s passionate and competitive, and so am I,” Patrick says. “I’ve always been there in the background to guide her if she comes unstuck and asks her dad for help.“If she’s down, I’m a picker-upper, and I was there for her for physio and hospital appointments. It’s taken determination and grit to get past her injury, but having good people around you, that’s what gets you through.”In 2014, during her rehabilitation, Perri met her fiance, Mike Edwards, an entrepreneur and athlete. Welcomed by the family with open arms – “It’s like I’ve gained a brother and Norma has gained a son,” Jodie says – he helped Perri to connect with the world beyond sport during her recovery.“Perri had a strong desire to get back on top, but I wanted to offer her positive distractions and give her a bigger life beyond track and field,” Mike explains. “With my cigar business, I’d developed myself as a person and, in turn, Perri had achieved athletic goals I was trying to achieve myself. We really inspired each other.“After all she’s been through, she’s bulletproof. It’s great that we’ve been able to support each other.” Perri has come a long way – and as always, her family will be right behind her in Australia. “Everything she feels, we feel, so it’s like we’re all running that race with her,” Jodie says. “We lifted her back up as a family – and when she competes at the games, everyone will see what we see.”npower – proud sponsors of Team England and Jerusalem, their official anthem for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

For there – as medieval maps sometimes warned travelers – “be dragons”.Donald Trump has been lectured repeatedly on this score by various advisers and pundits. Yet word keeps leaking out of the White House that Trump would like nothing more than to fire Robert Mueller. So far, Trump has heeded the warnings. But how much longer, one wonders, can a man who famously bragged that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it be expected to resist temptation to dismiss the special counsel?Since May 2017, Mueller, dogged as Inspector Javert in Les Misérables, has been investigating assorted misdeeds allegedly committed by Trump and his aides – from “collusion” with Russians meddling in the 2016 presidential election to the payment of large sums of hush money to a porn actor and a former Playboy model. Mueller has already either indicted or wrung guilty pleas from 19 people, including Trump’s former campaign chair. What’s more, it appears that Mueller is following a trail left by former FBI director James Comey, whom Trump did fire last year, on a possible obstruction of justice charge against the president.Clearly, Trump is feeling pinched and would like the cause of his pain to vanish. So let us review the short history of that golden rule everyone keeps warning him about.The investigation into Trump and his team appears to encompass allegations of\u0026nbspcollusion,\u0026nbspobstruction of justice,\u0026nbspabuse of power\u0026nbspand charges specific to\u0026nbspTrump aides and former aides.Any case along these lines against the president would be historic. Both of the presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the past century, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon, faced obstruction of justice and abuse of power charges.It\u0027s important to note that the work of the\u0026nbspspecial counsel\u0026nbspis secret, and the public has no way of knowing for certain what charges prosecutors may be weighing against the Trump team or,\u0026nbspin what would be an extraordinary development,\u0026nbspagainst the president himself.Mueller\u0026nbspis authorized to investigate any links andor coordination between the Russian government and iniduals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump and related matters. In other words, potential collusion during the 2016 election.But so-called “collusion” is only part of it. The\u0026nbspspecial counsel\u0026nbsphas the broad authority to build a prosecution wherever the inquiry may lead. The investigation has already resulted in charges against former Trump aides such as tax fraud that do not relate directly to election activity.In the course of the investigation,\u0026nbspTrump\u0027s past business practices\u0026nbsphave also\u0026nbspcome under scrutiny. With his first indictments of people in Trump\u0027s orbit, the special counsel has demonstrated an appetite for the prosecution of\u0026nbspalleged white-collar crimes.\u0026nbspThe president has denied all wrongdoing.On Friday, 19 October 1973, Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox issued a subpoena for copies of tape recordings made by Richard Nixon in the Oval Office. With that, Nixon decided he’d had just about enough of Cox, an upright and highly respected attorney and Harvard law professor.The very next day, Nixon ordered his attorney general, Elliot Richardson, who had appointed Cox the previous May, to fire him immediately. Richardson refused and resigned. His successor in the justice department’s chain of command, the deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus, likewise refused and resigned. Next up was the solicitor general (and acting attorney general), Robert Bork, who obeyed the president’s order, fired Cox and kept his job. The White House announced the firing – soon dubbed “the Saturday Night Massacre” – at 8.35pm that same night.As a member of Time magazine’s Watergate reporting team, I well remember that night 45 years ago. Normally, by 8.30pm on a Saturday night, the magazine was entering the final stages of its weekly production cycle. But on this Saturday night, Time’s Washington bureau was in all-out crisis mode – correspondents, including me, were frantically phoning sources in Congress, in the White House, in the justice department, at the FBI and anywhere else imaginable, trying to learn what precisely had happened and why and what the ramifications were. Until the previous December, I had been on a three-year assignment, covering the Vietnam war. So I was not unfamiliar with what it felt like to report under pressure. But this situation was something completely new to me. We all understood that a political volcano had just erupted, and I think many of us sensed that the US was on the brink of being changed forever. Not since the civil war had an American president seemed so close to impeachment and never before had the list of impeachable “high crimes and misdemeanors” against a sitting president been so lengthy. The words “constitutional crisis” were on just about everyone’s lips as the full impact of the Cox firing began to be felt during those hectic hours of crash reporting, writing and filing by telex and phone that were necessary in order for us to get the news into the magazine that would be in mailboxes and on the stands 48 to 72 hours later.Soon, Congress also swung into action. At least 22 impeachment resolutions were quickly introduced in the House, along with 12 bills and resolutions, sponsored by 94 Democrats and four Republicans, calling for the appointment of a new special prosecutor. So ferocious was the public and official outcry that within 12 days, a new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, was indeed appointed, and would win access to the Nixon tapes before the supreme court. In the meantime, the Senate select committee on Watergate continued its televised hearings, uncovering layer on layer of criminal and unconstitutional behavior.Eventually, the tapes obtained by Jaworski provided the “smoking gun” of Nixon’s involvement in the Watergate cover-up, which in turn led the House judiciary committee to approve three articles of impeachment on bipartisan votes, and forced Nixon’s resignation in disgrace less than a year after the Saturday Night Massacre.As for me, I knew Nixon was doomed politically when, just a week after the massacre, I received a letter from Irene Cloud, my aunt who lived in the tiny town of Kingman, Kansas, some 50 miles or so west of Wichita. Cloud was a dedicated Lincoln Republican in the moderate, anti-slavery Kansas tradition that had existed from the civil war to the 21st century, when the far right captured the state house. An unmarried grammar school teacher, Cloud wrote me rarely but always to a purpose. When I opened the envelope, I found inside a light blue sheet of note paper on which in her perfect, schoolmarm’s hand, she had written “Dear Stanley, I have reached the conclusion that Mr Nixon is a bad man …”If Nixon had lost my Aunt Irene, he had lost the nation.Not everyone today believes that Donald Trump will necessarily suffer the same fate as Nixon should he fire Robert Mueller. At least two good friends of mine who are experts in measuring public opinion – and who are not themselves conservatives – told me recently that they believe Trump’s “base” in the Republican party will stick with him in a way that Nixon’s base, including my Aunt Irene, did not. “They would think firing Mueller was just another example of Trump bringing Washington to heel,” said one.Perhaps so. But there are still dragons out there.Stanley Cloud was part of Time magazine’s Watergate team, and went on to become Time’s Washington DC bureau chief"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00b0eb2ab4a4fc390ffae9992939da860f07f18/0_157_3020_1812/master/3020.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f88fc658ffd3a850fcbf1846311d8b7 6000w","title":"a bomb silenced daphne caruana galizia but her investigation lives on","story":"The Daphne Project reveals the story so far behind the murder of a Maltese journalistby  Juliette Garside in MaltaThe explosion was so loud it shook the windows of the family home.In a cold panic, Matthew Caruana Galizia ran to the front door, barefoot. “That moment, opening the door, the dogs barking, the light, I just thought I was going to collapse on to the floor.”The neighbours were already outside. He sprinted past them, down the dirt track that leads to the village road, barely aware of the stones cutting into the soles of his feet. Halfway down he saw the column of black smoke.In front of him were the remains of a burning car, his mother’s. She had been inside it.The murder six months ago of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia sent shockwaves around the world.In Malta, the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and his party stand accused of allowing corruption to go unpunished, of weakening the police and the judiciary, of allowing an environment in which her killing became possible.But it goes deeper than that. The European Union must now decide how to deal with its smallest member state – an island that appears to have become a magnet for criminals and kleptocrats, and that some MEPs fear has become a gateway for dirty money into the rest of the continent, including the UK.The profound questions raised by Caruana Galizia’s murder have become the focus of a new collaboration: the Daphne Project.With the support of her family, a group of 18 international media organisations, including the Guardian, Reuters and Le Monde, has come together. Led by Forbidden Stories, whose mission is to continue the work of silenced journalists, the group has spent months piecing together Caruana Galizia’s story and pursuing the investigations she was working on when she was killed.Today, the project launches with the story of her murder, of the men facing trial for the crime, and the enduring mystery of who ordered it, and why.Daphne Caruana Galizia had spent her last morning working at the dining room table opposite her eldest son, Matthew, 32. The air was still and heavy with the scent of wild fennel. The densely planted garden of her hilltop home in the northern village of Bidnija muffled any noise from the road. She was absorbed in her work, and the hours passed unnoticed.Just before 3pm Caruana Galizia hastily gathered her things – she was late for an appointment at the bank. She rushed out, came back for some forgotten cheques, then climbed into her car.As the charcoal grey Peugeot 108 headed south out of the village, she was being watched. For her killers, the moment had come a bomb placed under the driver’s seat was detonated by remote control.A neighbour, Francis Sant, who was driving in the opposite direction, recalls a first explosion, which sent out white smoke and debris. Moments later, there was a second, much larger blast and the vehicle caught fire, before careering off the road into fields.In an interview for this project, Sant said: “I am going to say something that I have never said before. Because I felt that I shouldn’t say it … I even heard her screaming … But as soon as she screamed she became a ball of fire.”As Matthew sprinted towards the scene, he remembers seeing a crater in the road. Trees were on fire. He could see glass, and plastic, and pieces of flesh.He couldn’t see the car but he could hear it the horn was blaring. He followed the noise and the smoke, all the while hoping it was not his mother’s vehicle.But then he recognised the licence plate. Circling, looking inside, there was nothing but orange fire. No sign of a body, no silhouette.He searched the ground for a stick to prise open what was left of the doors when he heard police sirens. “I was looking on the ground for something, and then I saw a leg. And I remember thinking to myself like OK … there is a leg on the ground, there are body parts up there, obviously no one could have survived this, so it’s pointless.”Soon, his mother’s sister arrived, and then, after some frantic phone calls, his father and two younger brothers. The family hunkered down in Bidnija, staying indoors for two weeks, avoiding the television crews. The days passed in a blur.But it was Matthew’s precise recollection of what his mother was doing in the minutes before she was killed that led to an apparent breakthrough in the murder inquiry.On 4 December last year, in an early morning swoop on the seedy port area of Marsa which involved soldiers arriving by boat and a Swat team storming in from the road, police arrested three men widely reported in Malta as being known to the police: brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, aged 55 and 53 respectively, and their associate Vincent Muscat, 55.The brothers were ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground. Muscat was handcuffed to an iron railing. Footage of the raid, shot from a soldier’s head camera, was released to the press.The focus of the operation that day was a large, rusty shed overlooking Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Known locally as the potato shed – it was once used for storing vegetables – the structure now shelters the colourful rowing boats of the Marsa Regatta Club.One end is fenced off. It contains weightlifting benches, a barbecue and a secure room with a metal door and shutters. Suspended from the ceiling are a Spider-Man toy, fishing tackle, and the severed heads and tails of marlin fish.This is where officers arrested the men – and where they suspect the murder was planned.“They used to come here at the beginning or the end of the day,” said one man who knew them. “Sometimes, they had visitors at night. They were the kind of people who, even in the middle of summer, they give you a chill.”The evidence that led police to suspect these men was compiled by Insp Keith Arnaud, a homicide detective who knew Daphne and had once tried to arrest her.His case has been set out in meticulous detail in testimony for an examining magistrate, who is deciding whether the accused should stand trial.Reviewed by the Guardian, the testimony shows how police zeroed in on the arrested men with help from the FBI and a team of forensic specialists from the Netherlands.They assumed the bomb had been triggered remotely, and had probably been linked to a mobile phone, so the question was: who was making calls that day, and from where?The evidence was provided by a major piece of FBI computer processing, undertaken in the US, and complicated by the fact that the Vodafone mast in Bidnija was “off grid” at the time of the murder.Thousands of calls redirected to other masts had to be sifted through before investigators believed they had found what they were looking for: the numbers of two devices that appear to have been used to detonate the bomb.Detectives believe the sim cards for the phones were bought almost a year before the murder, on 15 November 2016. The two numbers only ever communicated with each other.Further analysis revealed one of the sim cards was used in a basic Nokia handset the second, which Arnaud calls “the god device”, was attached to a circuit board like those used to switch on lights or central heating by remote control. Or, in this case, it seems, to detonate a bomb.Having apparently found the method for triggering the device, Arnaud’s team was unsure who had pressed the button.The intelligence services were already monitoring George Degiorgio’s personal phone, in connection with another investigation.Arnaud told the magistrate he was able to match the location data from George Degiorgio’s personal number with another device, thought to have been one of three “burner” phones acquired for the job. Over a period of weeks, they found the burner phones signalling to the network from the same masts as personal numbers used by the three accused.The data provided by the FBI showed that the night before the killing, all three burner phones were active in Bidnija. And at 1.41am, the circuit board sim was switched on.After that, the suspects headed their separate ways, Arnaud told the court. According to his account, Alfred Degiorgio spent the night in Bidnija and the other two left the village. By 6.15am on the day of the murder, George’s phones were allegedly signalling from the potato shed in Marsa. Shortly after that, they were said to be transmitting from the coastline around Valletta.Police matched the locations with CCTV footage and spotted a small cabin cruiser with a distinctive green hood. The boat, called the Maya, was registered in Alfred’s name, but the phone data led police to believe it was George at the helm that afternoon.At 2.55pm, the Maya stopped, idling along a sheltered stretch of water beneath a neoclassical whe ar memorial known as the Siege Bell. Minutes later, it is alleged, there were two phone calls to the boat, both from Bidnija. The first lasted 44sec the next, 1min 47sec.Arnaud’s testimony to the court explains: “If you look into why there were two calls, it matches perfectly with what Matthew Caruana Galizia said when he told us that when his mother left the house, she forgot the cheque book.“In our opinion … the spotter saw the victim come out, he informed the person at sea to prepare himself, the victim went into the house again, the call ended, but two minutes later it took place again.”At 2.58pm, a text message was sent to the “god device” containing a code designed to activate the circuit board in the bomb.Within minutes of the blast, Arnaud told the court, George was messaging his girlfriend: “Buy me wine, my love.” She replied: “OK.” At 4pm, CCTV shows the Maya cruising back towards its mooring.The police case relies upon the evidence provided by the phones, and more information may be forthcoming.A sweep of the harbour floor by army scuba ers led to the recovery of eight phones said to have been used by the accused.The Guardian understands that all the devices were sent to Europol in the Netherlands for analysis several weeks ago.Alongside the examining magistrate hearing police evidence against the alleged bombers, another magistrate, Anthony Vella, is investigating the murder. Europol, the FBI and a Maltese telecoms expert are reporting directly to him.The family’s hopes of discovering who ordered the killing rest with Vella, because they fear police will not pursue evidence that might lead to politicians. A source close to the investigation said police were focused on finding the bomb maker, and tracing any possible links to organised crime.Vella is “a very thorough, meticulous, no-nonsense person”, says the family’s lawyer, Jason Azzopardi. “The fact that these international experts are answerable to the magistrate is the way it should be because this case has reverberations that go beyond the shores of Malta.”The three suspects have said nothing since their arrest. George, known by the street name ic-Ciniz (the Chinese), simply pulled out his identity card and placed it on the interrogation room table during police questioning. Alfred, or il-Fulu (the Bean), would not even confirm his name.The Guardian understands that detectives suspect the men had been tipped off before their arrest. When officers came for them in Marsa, the phones they had allegedly used were already on the seabed, and George had his partner’s mobile number written on his hand.The Nationalist MP and former opposition leader Simon Busuttil is concerned that the raid appeared staged: “The assault was fully filmed and everything looked pre-set for maximum propaganda effect. Footage of the assault was quicky circulated on the media and looked like something out of a Marvel action film – theatrical.”All three men entered not guilty pleas and accepted legal aid, but declined to speak to their lawyers.They have yet to stand trial, and any suggestion they were acting on orders remains speculation.Certainly, Caruana Galizia had many enemies and many critics. She took aim at anyone she believed needed to be held to account – mobsters, business people, even the current leader of the Nationalist party, with which she had been closely aligned.Caruana Galizia’s second son, Andrew, lays the blame at the feet of the ruling Labour party.“Maltese citizens are completely naked when they interact with their state,” he said. “There’s no independent institution in between the citizen and the government. Her assassination became possible for that reason.”In the aftermath of the attack, and without the consent of the family, the government offered a €1m (£870,000) reward for information leading to the killers. Despite the arrests, it remains on the table.In a statement emailed by his spokesman, the prime minister said: “An investigation is ongoing into those who ordered the killing. I trust the Maltese police will investigate this case with full professionalism, and without fear or favour.” Muscat added that the murder had “shocked and outraged” him. “No prime minister would want a journalist to be murdered under any circumstances. This was an attack on our society and such a senseless act particularly affects a country our size. This murder does not reflect on the Maltese people, who enjoy a liberal, open and democratic society. The government is clear that the police will have whatever resources they need to pursue and prosecute those responsible.”The stakes for both Malta and the EU remain high.And for a family torn apart by the murder, there is anger, bewilderment, and an overwhelming feeling of loss.Matthew’s brother Paul, 29, flew in from London on the night of the murder and was confronted by a sight he will never forget.Their peaceful valley was, he says, unrecognisable: the familiar fields were floodlit, the road choked with police and television crews.As Andrew puts it: “It felt like the world had collapsed and no one was safe any more. Apart from my mother being taken away I also felt that my country had been taken away.”15 November 2016: Sim cards for mobile devices allegedly used to trigger the bomb are purchased.10 January 2017: The trigger sims are activated for the first time, in the area of Żebbuġ. One is placed inside a Nokia handset and used to send four text messages to the other, placed in a circuit board. After 20 minutes, the sims are switched off.19 August: Three burner phones believed to have been used by the bombers are activated within 20 minutes of each other.21 August: Trigger sims are switched on for the second time, and two text messages are sent between them. This appears to be a second test run.End of September: White rental car seen for the first time in the vicinity of Bidnija. Over the coming weeks it is spotted many times, parked near a lookout point.15 October: All three burner phones are located in Bidnija. Alfred Degiorgio’s personal phone and the device said to be his burner phone appear to remain there all night and most of the following day.16 October:1.41am - Trigger sim is switched on. It signals from Bidnija, where Caruana Galizia’s car is parked outside her home.8am - The Maya is filmed on CCTV leaving Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Phone data suggests only George Degiorgio was on board.8.30am – The Vodafone mast in Bidnija goes off grid and is closed for maintenance until 6pm.2.55pm - CCTV shows the Maya stopping in sheltered water beneath the Siege Bell war memorial.2.58pm –  Text message is allegedly sent from the boat to the circuit board sim, detonating a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of Caruana Galizia’s car.3.20pm – Phone data shows the Maya heading back towards the harbour.3.30pm - George Degiorgio sends a message from his personal phone to his partner: “Buy me wine, my love.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6077ffbd82ba44726ed6319c5fcdc0ebd884814/23_106_2438_1462/master/2438.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0735cc438f529dbf931613d619bf1956 1240w","title":"geese breeding dutch motorists netherlands","story":"Hundreds of geese spotted in grasslands around roads in east Netherlands, with some birds swooping into paths of vehiclesThe emergence of the Netherlands as the most popular place in Europe for geese has prompted an urgent call for Dutch drivers to watch out for hundreds of birds breeding on the grassy junctions and motorways verges.The Netherlands’ intensive farming and temperate climate make it the best country for geese in Europe, according to the Sovon Dutch centre for field ornithology, the organisation responsible for surveying bird populations.The population boom, however, is not without problems. Roadside grasslands are particularly attractive to breeding birds because of their the abundance of clover leaves and protection from predators.Hundreds of geese have been spotted off roads in Gelderland in the east of the country and elsewhere. Others have been swooping down into the paths of cars and lorries, presumably seeking to protect their offspring. A stretch of road in the town of Opheusden, in Gelderland, reported four collisions in a week.Albert de Jong from the Sovon centre called for drivers to be wary, but insisted that it was for the government now to take the risks seriously and build infrastructure to deter the birds from major roads.“We have during the summer more than 500,000 geese and we are a small country,” he said. “That’s because we are very suitable for them. The junctions on the motorways provide small pieces of nature. There is grass, access to water, and they are away from predatory risk as it is too dangerous for the foxes. Geese are very opportunistic.“It is a dangerous situation. I have seen some just flying in front of vehicles or walking on to the roads. They are defending their territory. First of all we need to discover the areas where they are breeding, where this is a problem. We know a lot of them but not all of them. We need to make it less attractive to the geese. Drivers aren’t going to drive more slowly for them.”The Dutch government had said in 2013 that it wanted to reduce the size of its goose population back to its 2005 levels which, experts say, would entail the slaughter of 500,000 birds. The state pays tens of millions of euros to farmers every year to compensate for damage to crops caused by greylag, barnacle and white-fronted geese.Schiphol and Noord-Holland have been in a long-running fight for approval to gas thousands of geese in the area around the airport, one of the biggest in Europe, despite a court ban.A spokesman for the Rijkswaterstaat, which is responsible for road safety, told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that it was constantly erecting fences to keep animals off the roads but that this was impossible for flying birds. “We cannot quite avoid that entirely,” the spokesman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b11e8fcaefe5a45b1fd2f256ea5546f8e137b33/0_438_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5480c04caf39ab25a6df00ecb22d89ee 1240w","title":"iran prepares to block messaging app telegram","story":"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei shuts down channel to ‘safeguard national interest’, but app is hugely popular in countryIran is expected to block the popular messaging app Telegram, following similar measures taken by Russia, after the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, announced he was leaving the service to safeguard the national interest.Telegram has proved a massive success in Iran, dwarfing the number of people using its global rival WhatsApp, and surpassing Facebook and Twitter, which have both been blocked for a long time in the country. About 40 million Iranians – almost half of the country’s population – are estimated to be on Telegram, which has also appealed to older generations previously unfamiliar with the use of such social media platforms. In addition to one-to-one or group messaging, it allows users to broadcast posts to large audiences with its channel function. Khamenei’s office announced on Wednesday that it was shutting down the ayatollah’s Telegram channel in order to safeguard national interests and end what it said was Telegram’s monopoly on the country’s social media.The announcement also signalled that a nationwide ban on the app was imminent. “This move comes ahead of plans by the authorities to block Telegram and is aimed at supporting domestic social media apps,” read the brief message. Iran’s vice-president, Eshaq Jahangiri, also announced that he was quitting Telegram. Officials also sent a directive to all civil servants and government departments telling them to stop using Telegram. Iran has been mulling a ban on Telegram ever since protests over economic grievances at the end of last year took on a political dimension before spreading to up to 80 cities in January. Officials blamed Telegram for providing a platform for protesters to organise rallies.The country’s technology minister personally reached out to Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, at the time, asking him to block channels that he alleged were spreading violence, prompting one such channel – that had been spreading misinformation – to be blocked. Although officials have been entertaining the idea of a ban in recent months, the app’s popularity means they are wary of any public backlash. Telegram has also become a source of income for hundreds of Iranians behind popular channels. A 23-year-old Iranian behind two cultural channels with over 80,000 followers said he was worried because he earned about £800 per month from posting ads. “I relied on it as a source of income, now I have to go and find another job. It wasn’t solely for entertainment, it was also my business,” said the Iranian user, who wished to remain anonymous. “I built my channels during four years and filtering Telegram will put all that time and energy to waste.”Iranians have shown huge resilience when it comes to the state blocking their access to online services, sites and social platforms. They have mastered anti-filtering software to bypass state restrictions and often migrate in their millions to a new platform when one is blocked. The success of Telegram is partly thanks to Iranians rapidly switching to the messaging service when Viber was blocked. Earlier this month, Khamenei said it was religiously forbidden for officials to intrude upon people’s privacy through domestic apps, but that has done little to soothe concerns by ordinary people about domestic substitutes, particularly in a country where online censorship is rife and intelligence authorities resort to hacking without any judicial permission. Iran’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, has strongly advocated free access to social media and messaging apps since coming to power in 2013. But the body that polices the internet in Iran is not under his full control, leaning more towards the ayatollah. The news in Iran comes after Russia’s internet watchdog blocked an estimated 16m IP addresses in a massive operation against the banned Telegram messaging app four days after a court ordered the service to be blocked over alleged terrorism concerns.On Tuesday, Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower living in Russia, came out in support of Durov, on Tuesday, tweeting:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40b0713be3c312846ead3241bb97287851e9502b/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=51f75108703e99cfa2d7e7a5002f3aa7 1240w","title":"puerto rico blackout power out electricity grid hurricane maria","story":"An island-wide blackout has hit Puerto Rico, which is struggling with an increasingly unstable power grid nearly seven months after Hurricane Maria hit the US territory.An Electric Power Authority spokeswoman, Yohari Molina, told the Associated Press that crews were investigating the cause.

But on the streets of Havana, indifference – not hope – is in the air.No posters or billboards referring to the changeover are to be seen, the identity of the new leader is hardly a topic of conversation, and nobody doubts that the existing political system will remain intact. As the Cuban saying goes: nobody can fix it, but nobody can knock it down.“A new president isn’t going to change anything so it’s not important for me,” shrugged María Victoria Esteves, 27, on her way to buy bread. “I think everything’s going to stay the same.”Yadiel Sintra, 30, a builder working in Cuba’s private sector said he wasn’t even aware the country was about to get a new president. “I’ve just found out talking to you!” he said.Díaz-Canel is widely expected to represent continuity, and few Cubans expect any dramatic shift, said Rafael Hernández, a political analyst and member of the Communist party.  There are no direct presidential elections in Cuba. When legislators for the National Assembly were elected this March, 605 candidates stood unopposed. Every one was elected.“If a new president were to represent a fundamental change in people’s lives, Cubans would be very focused on this,” he said. “But the fact is they don’t see it like this.”Though relieved of the presidency, Castro, 86, will remain a political presence, staying on as first secretary of the Communist party until 2021.“The new president will have more power in the day-to-day,” said Hal Klepak, author of a biography of Raúl Castro. “But whenever there are crises or major problems with the US, foreign policy, or the economy, Raúl’s word will remain the last word.”Díaz-Canel, a cautious reformist hand-picked by Raúl Castro, will be expected to walk the tightrope of implementing more market-oriented reforms without sacrificing Cuba’s social policies.Health and education remain free at the point of use in Cuba. The country has the most doctors per capita of any country in the Americas, and life expectancy is 79. And while Cubans on state salaries feel the pinch when buying meat and vegetables, essential foodstuffs are guaranteed by the state.Human rights groups say that the government continues to punish dissent and public criticism. The number of long-term political prisoners in Cuba dropped significantly under Raúl Castro, as the government shifted from long-term incarceration to short-term arrest and release, which typically lasts hours. But the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation say that last year more than 5,000 people were arrested for political reasons. Although in government for over a decade, Díaz-Canel’s politics are unknown to most Cubans. His relative obscurity reflects the top-down way public affairs are practised in an island where there is only one legal political party, and where political campaigning is prohibited by law.A former minister of higher education, Díaz-Canel has been criticised for coming across as stiff in his occasional media appearances, but his image is radically different from the late Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl. As the first secretary of the provincial Communist party in Villa Clara province in the 1990s he was known for his long hair, riding his bicycle and walking around in Bermuda shorts. He was a strong advocate for LGBT rights at a time when homosexuality was frowned upon in the province and by many in the party.Crucially, he was born after the Cuban revolution. If elected, Díaz-Canel will also be the first non-soldier in charge of the nation since 1959.“Accusations that Cuba is a military dictatorship have cut deep,” said Klepak. “It’s useful to have somebody who has come up through the system and didn’t arrive there through the use of arms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/113b8ed6891824c910bf24a4bf94a5b7a21ea6d4/0_186_3964_2379/master/3964.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1056492c4e589683d3fad64e1677a147 1240w","title":"turkey to hold snap elections on 24 june says erdogan","story":"Turkish president says country urgently needs to make switch to an executive presidencyTurkey has brought forward presidential and parliamentary elections that could pave the way for a single-party state with few checks on the power of the president, to 24 June, a year and a half ahead of schedule.Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, announced the new date after meeting Devlet Bahçeli, his ally and head of the nationalist bloc in parliament, who had called on Tuesday for early elections.“We have decided that elections should be held on 24 June 2018,” Erdoğan said at the presidential palace. “Our preference has been to try to hold out till the date in November 2019. However, whether it be the cross-border operation in Syria, or the historic developments in Iraq and Syria have made it so that it is paramount for Turkey to overcome uncertainty.”The winner will assume the presidency of the Turkish republic with broad new powers that were approved after a constitutional referendum last year. The elections are likely to take place under a state of emergency that has been in place since a coup attempt in July 2016.Before Wednesday Erdoğan had repeatedly pledged to hold the elections in 2019 as originally planned, but fears of an economic downturn had recently rekindled speculation that he might change his mind. Bahçeli’s proposal and its quick acceptance by the president was a stunning turnaround that will leave just two months before elections that will transform the political scene in Turkey, sealing its evolution from a parliamentary democracy into an executive presidency with sweeping powers.Turkey held a referendum on presidential powers in April last year. Narrowly approved by voters, the constitutional amendments abolished the office of prime minister and allowed the president to be a member of a political party, appoint unelected vice-presidents, and have a greater say in appointing judges to the highest judicial board in the country, as well as issuing decrees with the force of law.On 16 April 2017 Turkish voters narrowly approved a package of constitutional amendments granting President Erdoğan sweeping new powers.The amendments will transform the country from a parliamentary democracy into a presidential system – arguably the most significant political development since the Turkish republic was declared in 1923.Under the new system - which is not due to take affect until after elections in June – Erdoğan will be able to stand in two more election cycles, meaning he could govern as a powerful head of state until 2029.\u0026nbspThe new laws will notionally allow Erdoğan to hire and fire judges and prosecutors, appoint a cabinet, abolish the post of prime minister, limit parliament’s role to amend legislation and much more.The president\u0027s supporters say the new system will make Turkey safer and stronger. Opponents fear it will usher in an era of authoritarian one-man rule.\u0026nbspThe government, led by Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP), has launched a wide-ranging crackdown on dissidents in the aftermath of the coup, which is widely believed to have been carried out by followers of Fethullah Gülen, an exiled preacher based in Pennsylvania.The crackdown has gone beyond the Gülenists to encompass opposition MPs, academics and the media, with dissident journalists imprisoned or facing prosecution for allegedly abetting terrorist groups. Turkey this year was the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, ahead of China and Egypt. “I think 24 June is going to be a historic day in Turkey,” said Soner Çağaptay, director of the Turkish programme at the Washington Institute and author of a biography of Erdoğan. “It is when the office of prime minister will cease to exist, when the president will be able to rule by decree and the executive presidency will fully form. We will be switching from one Turkey to another, and it will be a dramatic day.” Bahçeli, whose Nationalist Movement party (MHP) entered into a formal electoral alliance with the AKP, had called on Tuesday for elections to be held in August.. Erdoğan said Turkey’s ongoing campaigns in Syria and Iraq, where it has intervened to fight Islamic State militants and Kurdish paramilitaries, as well as the need to more rapidly implement the new presidential system, made it necessary to hold early elections. Turkish-backed rebels in Syria recently achieved victory in a campaign to conquer the Kurdish enclave of Afrin near the border, a military operation that was widely popular in Turkey. But experts and observers say the early elections are meant to get ahead of the effects of economic troubles. An ongoing steep fall in the value of the Turkish lira, coupled with warnings of an overheating economy and a widening current account deficit, threaten the popularity of the AKP, which has often banked on a healthy and growing economy as a key element of its popular strength. The party is also likely to capitalise on nationalist sentiment, which is on the rise after the Afrin operation. Early elections may also leave Erdoğan with a limited field of competitors. The main secularist opposition bloc, the Republican People’s party (CHP), has failed to win successive elections for 16 years and struggles to field credible presidential candidates. Selahattin Demirtaş, the charismatic leader of the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic party (HDP) has been in prison for over a year and his party has been decimated by arrests of mayors, cadres and MPs, with lawsuits stripping the latter of their immunity. Meral Akşener, a popular nationalist leader who defected from Bahçeli’s party last year to set up her own, may face procedural hurdles for her party to run in the elections because of a rule that requires political parties to hold a general congress at least six months before the polls. She was billed as a credible opponent to Erdoğan due to her nationalist credentials and the fact that she is a practicing Muslim with secular views on government, and her ability to target both centrist voters and others from the president’s base. Akşener may still be able to run for the presidency even if her party does not qualify to run for parliament.

But with buoyant house prices and stagnant wages, what are the steps to getting on the property ladder?If you’re dreaming of buying your first home, it’s not surprising. It will mean the freedom to put your stamp on a place that’s truly yours, but some say you’ll also save money. According to research published by the Bank of Scotland in February 2018, buying a home is cheaper in terms of monthly costs than renting, and saves first-time buyers between £590 and £2,190 a year around the UK, on average, depending on area. So how can you join them?How much you can potentially borrow will also have a bearing on how much you need to save. “As a very general rule of thumb, you’ll usually be able to borrow around four times your salary, which, if you earn £30,000, means a potential mortgage of £120,000,” says Wallis. “The difference between your borrowing power and what you have to pay for a property is the minimum you should save.”In addition, Audhlam-Gardiner suggests that a Lifetime Isa is more flexible in terms of the type of house you can buy: if outside London, the most you can pay for a property with a Lifetime Isa is £450,000, rather than £250,000 with a help-to-buy Isa (for Londoners the limit is the same as for a Lifetime Isa). Plus, with the help-to-buy Isa, the government bonus can only be used on completion, whereas it can be used towards a deposit or split up across the process with a Lifetime Isa. Finding the right first home for your savings is just half the battle. “First-time buyers can take years to save for a deposit for their dream home,” says Lisa Hardstaff of credit reference agency, Equifax. “But a lack of understanding about the mortgage application process – including how credit information is used – could push their dream back even further.” About half of first-time buyers take between one and five years to save a deposit, says Hardstaff. “It is worth using this time to get your credit report in good shape.” David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker London \u0026amp Country Mortgages, agrees: “Ensuring that you are on the electoral roll where you live is a simple thing to do but could make a big difference. Having one or two well-managed credit cards can help, while having none could go against you. Regular use of payday loans could result in a straight decline from a lender.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3465833.1524062863!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why the good weather this week is not a mini heatwave","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoxer dogs Tyson and Lexie, from Ringsend, Dublin, enjoying the warmer weather in the sea at Sandymount. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw It may feel like it’s unseasonably warm in coming days, but that is more to do with a winter marked by low average temperatures since January, including two extended periods when large dumpings of snow fell on most of the country – and months marked by a notable absence of Sun.All of that means “nature is behind” its normal cycle, according to forecaster Harm Luijkx.This week will add up to “a short spell of decent weather, ending in the middle of the weekend”, he adds. And while it is a welcome change from a long Irish winter, which was also marked by above average rainfall in most areas, temperatures will struggle to reach 18 degrees.Eastern areas and the midlands will benefit most from the warmer conditions, in contrast to the west of Ireland.By Saturday, the best that can be hoped for is 16 degrees, though it will feel humid– average temperatures for this time of year are 12 to 13 degrees.By Sunday, it will back to cooler temperatures, but normal for this time of year, and with broken weather due to Atlantic weather fronts replacing the effects of a high over mainland Europe.London and southeast England are predicted to reach temperatures of 25 to 26 degrees in coming days due to that high pressure over the Continent, he says, but even that would not be classified as a mini-heatwave – such temperatures are normal for that region, he says.The rise in Irish temperatures will nonetheless improve soil temperatures, Luijkx predicts, and improve growing conditions for farmers, who have had to struggle with waterlogged fields and a dearth of fodder due to a lack of grass – heralding a very late but welcome spring.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?The Crossword Club provides access to an archive of more than 6,000 interactive crosswords from The Irish Times.

Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons On November 10th, 2016 the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), which signs off on mergers and takeovers, approved Independent News \u0026amp Media’s planned takeover of Celtic Media Group.This came just over two months after INM announced that it wanted to take over the regional newspaper group, which owns the Anglo-Celt in Cavan, the Meath Chronicle and the Connaught Telegraph.The acquisition would have increased the size of the INM, the country’s largest media company, which already owned regional newspapers including The Kerryman, the Sligo Champion and the Wexford People.Legal papers filed by Director of Corporate Enforcement Ian Drennan last month in his bid to seek the appointment of High Court inspectors to INM reveal confidential contacts between various parties who had an interest in whether the merger should proceed, including Minister for Communications Denis Naughten. According to the sequence of events outlined by Drennan in his affidavit and emails reproduced in his court papers, Eoghan Ó Neachtain, the director of public affairs at public relations firm Heneghan PR, telephoned Minister Naughten on the afternoon of November 11th, 2016 about the takeover.Mr Ó Neachtain told The Irish Times this week he was hired by INM, a client of the PR firm, to find out the Minister’s reaction to the decision of the CCPC not to block the proposed takeover and to see if Naughten intended to refer to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, which signs off on mergers of media companies. The decision by the CCPC raising no competition concerns about the merger effectively put the proposed acquisition back on the minister’s desk for consideration.The CCPC reviews media mergers on their narrow economic impact, while the BAI examines proposed mergers on a cross-media ownership basis and whether it damages media plurality. An email sent by Nigel Heneghan, managing director of the firm where Ó Neachtain works, to INM’s then chairman Leslie Buckley at 9.36am on November 12th, 2016 outlines details of Ó Neachtain’s conversation with the minister the previous afternoon.Heneghan wrote that the minister told Ó Neachtain that based on the advice of his officials he would refer INM’s proposed acquisition of Celtic Media to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for review because of the level of ownership of media companies, broadcast and print, by Denis O’Brien, INM’s biggest shareholder.Heneghan concluded his email to Buckley telling him that this information was “to be treated as highly confidential as the minister has not been officially informed yet of the CCPC decision.” The email was, according to Drennan’s affidavit, forwarded by Buckley to O’Brien at 10.07am.Drennan claims that the information communicated by Buckley to O’Brien - including this November 12th, 2016 email - may fall within the definition of inside information given that INM is a public company and that, as a result, Buckley may potentially be in breach of stock market rules, namely Market Abuse Regulations.Ó Neachtain told The Irish Times this week the minister told him on their telephone call that, regardless of the CCPC’s decision, he was going to refer the proposed takeover to the BAI. On November 23rd 2016 the minister told The Irish Times in an interview he had not considered INM’s takeover of Celtic Media, despite his reported remarks to Ó Neachtain.“I haven’t got the recommendations yet from my officials and as soon as I do I will weigh all that up,” he told Irish Times journalist Laura Slattery in the interview, which was published in early December 2016.In a February 7th, 2017 reply to a parliamentary question, Naughten said that following approval of the merger by the CCPC, he received notification of the proposed merger on November 21st, 2016.In his reply, the minister said that he had 30 working days from the notification deadline of November 24th 2016 to conduct an initial assessment on whether the merger should proceed as it may be contrary to the public interest in protecting the plurality of the media in the State. Following this initial assessment, or “phase one examination,” he decided on January 10th, 2017 to ask the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to conduct “a full media merger examination of the proposed transaction.” The BAI was given 80 days to examine if the takeover would be damaging media plurality in Ireland given that it would have increased INM’s ownership of regional newspapers from 13 to 20.In the end, INM and Celtic Media decided to walk away from the proposed deal by mutual consent in June 2017 shortly before the Minister was due to consider the BAI’s report on the acquisition.- Full text of email sent to then Independent News \u0026amp Media chairman Leslie Buckley by public relations executive Nigel Heneghan at 9.36am on November 12th, 2016.

The EU is trying to reinvigorate its plans for expansion in the Balkans, in part to counter rising Russian and Chinese influence in the strategic region, despite doubts among many member states and calls to introduce new rules for the bloc.“Your country has come a long way despite difficult circumstances, has managed to overcome a deep political crisis and is now firmly back on the EU path,” EU enlargement commissioner Johannes Hahn said in Skopje on Wednesday.“Reforms are being carried out in a more open, transparent and inclusive manner... but there is no room for complacency. The momentum of reforms needs to continue, especially in important areas like improving the independence of the judiciary.”Since taking power last May after two years of political deadlock, a Social Democrat-led government has tried to improve Macedonia’s ties with neighbouring Bulgaria and Greece, and relations with Athens are crucial to its EU bid.Athens has refused to back Macedonia’s efforts to join the EU and Nato until it changes the name that it shares with a region of northern Greece, and which allegedly implies a territorial claim to the area.The governments of both countries say they are now close to a deal, however, and Macedonia will need Greece and all other member states to approve the start of accession talks when EU leaders meet in June.“It’s not easy to find a deal...but we fully support this process and hope a mutually acceptable solution can be found very soon,” Mr Hahn said alongside Macedonian prime minister Zoran Zaev. Mr Zaev said his government had “changed stagnation and corrupted policies for reforms and friendships that are moving forward.”In Albania, meanwhile, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini hailed a “historic moment” for the country and the bloc, but said that “maintaining and deepening the reforms that you have undertaken” was now crucial.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker told the European Parliament on Tuesday that if the EU failed to offer membership to Balkan states “we will see war returning to that area as we saw in the 1990s”.French president Emmanuel Macron told the assembly, however, that he “will only defend an enlargement once there has been a deepening and a reform of our Europe. ”“I don’t want a Balkans that turns toward Turkey or Russia, but I don’t want a Europe that, working with difficulty at 28 and tomorrow at 27, decided that it could continue to run at 30 or 32 tomorrow with the same rules.”Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"there s a hole and someone went out southwest pilot tells air traffic control","story":"  April 18, 2018Plane violently depressurized after fragments from explosion hit window Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Passengers reported seeing a woman being given medical attention on the plane.“One passenger, a woman, was partially … was drawn out towards the outside of the plane … was pulled back in by other passengers,\u0026quot Todd Burr, the father of another passenger, told NBC10.Oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling and passengers said their prayers and braced for impact.Investigators examine damage to the engine of the Southwest Airlines plane \u0026quotI just remember holding my husband\u0027s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed,\u0026quot said passenger Amanda Bourman, of New York.\u0026quotAnd the thoughts that were going through my head of course were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again and give them a big hug so they wouldn\u0027t grow up without parents.\u0026quotMs Bourman said she was seated near the back and was asleep when she heard a loud noise and oxygen masks dropped. She said the plane was fairly quiet because everyone was wearing a mask.Passengers on board the plane wear oxygen masks \u0026quotEverybody was crying and upset,\u0026quot she said. \u0026quotYou had a few passengers that were very strong, and they kept yelling to people, you know, \u0027It\u0027s OK! We\u0027re going to do this!\u0027\u0026quotShe added that passengers clapped and praised the pilot after the aircraft touched down.Passenger Marty Martinez went on Facebook Live while wearing an oxygen mask.

Emergency landing!! Southwest flight from NYC to Dallas!!\u0026quotVideo: Passenger records mid-air drama on FacebookAfter the plane landed, he posted photos of a broken window near the left engine.Ms Bourman said she saw emergency workers using a defibrillator to help a woman who was then taken off the plane. She said that she also saw a man rush to cover the broken window and that the man had a bandage around his arm after the plane landed.Passengers did \u0026quotsome pretty amazing things under some pretty difficult circumstances,\u0026quot Mr Thiel said.How the Southwest Airlines tragedy happenedTammie Jo Shults, a former Navy pilot, was at the controls when the plane made the emergency landing. She walked through the aisle and talked to passengers to make sure they were OK after the aircraft touched down.\u0026quotShe has nerves of steel. That lady, I applaud her,\u0026quot said Alfred Tumlinson, of Corpus Christi, Texas. \u0026quotI\u0027m going to send her a Christmas card, I\u0027m going to tell you that, with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.\u0026quotPilot Tammie Jo Shults was praised for her handling of the mid-air dramaIn a recording of conversations between the cockpit and air traffic controllers, an unidentified crew member reported that there was a hole in the plane and \u0026quotsomeone went out.\u0026quotMr Tumlinson said a man in a cowboy hat rushed forward a few rows to grab the woman and pull her back in.\u0026quotShe was out of the plane. He couldn\u0027t do it by himself, so another gentleman came over and helped to get her back in the plane, and they got her,\u0026quot he said.Passengers struggled to somehow plug the hole while giving the badly injured woman CPR.As the plane came in for a landing, everyone started yelling to brace for impact, then clapped after the aircraft touched down safely, Bourman said.The Federal Aviation Administration said the crew reported damage to one of the engines, the fuselage and at least one window.The NTSB sent a team of investigators to Philadelphia. Sumwalt said the engine will be taken apart and examined to understand what caused the failure.Southwest has about 700 planes, all of them 737s, including more than 500 737-700s like the one in Tuesday\u0027s incident.It is the world\u0027s largest operator of the 737. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.The jet\u0027s CFM56-7B engines were made by CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines of France.CFM said it sent technical experts to help NTSB investigators. In a statement, it said the CFM56-7B has had \u0026quotan outstanding safety and reliability record\u0026quot since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aricraft worldwide.John Goglia, a former NTSB member, said investigators will take the engine apart and look at its maintenance records as well.\u0026quotThere\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0026quot Goglia said. \u0026quotIn this case it didn\u0027t. That\u0027s going to be a big focal point for the NTSB - why didn\u0027t (the ring) do its job?\u0026quot\u0026quotWe\u0027re pushing the engines to produce as much power as possible,\u0026quot he added. \u0026quotWe\u0027re right on the edge. Sometimes they fail, and that\u0027s why the containment ring is there.\u0026quotA Southwest Airlines flight made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after one of its engines blew out mid airThe engine failure was reminiscent of a similar event on a Southwest Boeing 737-700 jet in August 2016 as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida.Shrapnel from the engine left a 5-by-16-inch hole just above the wing, and the oxygen masks dropped. The plane landed safely in Pensacola, Florida.NTSB investigators said one of the engine\u0027s fan blades broke off during the flight, apparently because of metal fatigue.Family, friends and community leaders are mourning the death of Mrs Riordan, a Wells Fargo bank executive and mother of two from Albuquerque, New Mexico.She was well known in New Mexico, where she had built a career over more than two decades in community relations and communications after graduating from the University of New Mexico.Gov Susana Martinez called Mrs Riordan \u0026quotan incredible woman who put her family and community first\u0026quot and said her loss would be felt across the state.\u0026quotThe hearts of all New Mexicans are with the Riordan family,\u0026quot Ms Martinez, a Republican, said in a statement on Tuesday.Jennifer Riordan was described as \u0026#39an incredible woman\u0026#39Before starting with Wells Fargo in 2008, Mrs Riordan had worked for the University of New Mexico hospital system in public relations and for Citigroup.At Wells Fargo, she was the vice president for community relations and was in charge of managing employee volunteer and board service to nonprofit groups in New Mexico and parts of Texas. She also served on numerous boards and oversaw the annual United Way community campaign.Mike English, a spokesman for Wells Fargo in New Mexico, said Mrs Riordan \u0026quotwas a well-known leader who was loved and respected\u0026quot.Jennifer Riordan and her husband, Michael Riordan, had been married for more than 20 yearsAlbuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said his thoughts and prayers were with Riordan\u0027s family.\u0026quotToday, Albuquerque lost a thoughtful leader who has long been part of the fabric of our community,\u0026quot Mr Keller, a Democrat, said in a statement.Mr Keller said Mrs Riordan\u0027s leadership and philanthropic efforts \u0026quotmade this a better place every day and she will be terribly missed\u0026quot.State Attorney General Hector Balderas called Mrs Riordan a dear friend. \u0026quotI was honoured to work with her on financial literacy issues for over a decade,\u0026quot said Mr Balderas, a Democrat. \u0026quotJennifer was exceptionally active and passionate in working to improve our community, and I express our sincerest condolences to her husband and children.\u0026quotJennifer Riordan was returning from a business trip to New York Members of the broadcast community shared their condolences on social media, remembering the volunteer efforts and outreach spurred by Mrs Riordan through her many roles in the community.In a tweet, the New Mexico Broadcasters Association expressed its heartbreak over Mrs Riordan\u0027s death, noting that she was a former board member and scholarship winner.Mrs Riordan also served on the boards of Junior Achievement of New Mexico, New Mexico First and The Catholic Foundation.Ryan Cangiolosi, chairman of the Republican Party of New Mexico, said Mrs Riordan loved Albuquerque and worked tirelessly to help others.\u0026quotHer leadership in numerous charitable causes made a real impact on our state and earned her the respect and admiration of New Mexicans across the political spectrum,\u0026quot Cangiolosi said.Mrs Riordan and her husband, Michael Riordan, a former chief operating officer for Albuquerque, had been married for more than 20 years.A lack of oxygen above 10,000ft means cabins have to be pressurised to ensure those on board can keep breathing. When the seal is broken - such as by a smashed window - compressed air rushes out, as conditions inside and outside the aircraft equalise.Chartered aeronautical engineer Guy Gratton said plane windows are thick and strong but \u0026quotlike anything else, they\u0027re capable of being broken\u0026quot.He said: \u0026quotIf you lose a window then you\u0027ve punched a hole in the pressure vessel. The air inside will try to escape.\u0026quotFor anybody close to that window, there\u0027s going to be an incredibly strong wind heading out. It\u0027s strong enough to suck somebody out of the window, potentially.\u0026quotMr Gratton outlined a number of other effects a severely damaged window could have.\u0026quotThe pressure will drop and the temperature will drop,\u0026quot he said. \u0026quotQuite likely it will suddenly get foggy inside the cabin, it will be really noisy.\u0026quotLots of people will be getting popping of ears. The oxygen masks will all drop. That all happens in a couple of seconds.\u0026quotIn 1990, a poorly-fitted section of the windscreen of a British Airways aircraft blew off, causing the captain, Tim Lancaster, to be pulled halfway out at 17,000ft over Oxfordshire.Cabin crew held on to his legs and co-pilot Alastair Atchison made an emergency landing in Southampton, where Mr Lancaster was treated in hospital for frostbite and a broken arm.Two years earlier, an Aloha Airlines flight lost a section of its roof when a hole caused decompression.A flight attendant was sucked out of the plane and died, but everyone else on board was wearing their seatbelt and survived.Please review our commenting policyTelegraph reader cracks two-year challenge of \u0026#39world\u0026#39s hardest crossword\u0026#39 in two hoursJewish men beaten with belt in Berlin anti-Semitic attackUK enjoys hottest day of the year as country basks in mini heatwaveItalian language under siege from imported English words, warns Florence academyBitcoin heist suspect escapes to Sweden \u0026#39on board flight with Iceland\u0026#39s prime minister\u0026#39Comment: It should have been Jeremy Corbyn’s easiest PMQs.

Older people should also reduce physical exertion.“Anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors.”The NHS has even publicised its tips for coping in a heatwave including limiting going outside between 11am and 3pm, wearing lose-fitting clothing and staying hydrated.The London Fire Brigade has also urged people to resist the temptation to jump into any of the capital\u0027s rivers.However, not all parts of the country were basking in the sun shine as parts of Wales, Scotland and the North West reported overcast conditions.The warm spell is expected to last into the weekend and temperatures forecast to return to their seasonal norms of around 16C on Monday.Meanwhile London Marathon organisers are preparing for the hottest even yet as temperatures could be has high as 24C for the race. The previous warmest temperatures were just over 22C in 1996 and 2007The organisers told the BBC: \u0026quotWe have a number of contingency plans in place in case of hot weather and we will be sending advice to runners and spectators later in the week that will be proportionate to race day.\u0026quotFather and son enjoying the sun on Primrose Hill LondonThe unseasonably warm weather comes less than two month after the UK was blanketed under snow as the cold snap dubbed the Beast from the East gripped Europe.The snow caused widespread disruption with the RAF called in to transport health workers and more than £10 million damage done to vehicles in the UK.The cold snap also saw the coldest March day on record with a low maximum of -4.7C  recorded in Tredegar, in South East Wales.A sunbather in St James\u0026#39 Park determined to capitalise on short heat wave The bookmakers Coral has now made it odds on, at 4-5, that 2018 goes on to be the hottest year on record as amid a surge in bets.\u0026quotThe sun is shining and the bets are flying in for this year to go on to be the hottest we\u0027ve ever had,\u0026quot said Coral\u0027s Harry Aitkenhead. \u0026quotWith a tropical blast giving us a glorious April we certainly can\u0027t rule it out, making it odds on at this stage.\u0026quotPlease review our commenting policyAnt McPartlin\u0026#39s comeback: the big questions, answeredTelegraph reader cracks two-year challenge of \u0026#39world\u0026#39s hardest crossword\u0026#39 in two hoursJewish men beaten with belt in Berlin anti-Semitic attackItalian language under siege from imported English words, warns Florence academyBitcoin heist suspect escapes to Sweden \u0026#39on board flight with Iceland\u0026#39s prime minister\u0026#39Comment: It should have been Jeremy Corbyn’s easiest PMQs.

This amounts to 100 weeks, or just over two years.\u0026quot  However, he did add that there would be people who would likely complete it faster than others.  Mr Lancaster commented that whilst the puzzle was reasonably challenging it was no harder that some of the Telegraph Toughie crosswords or Enigmatic Variations, adding: “I\u0027d expect anybody who can solve these to be able to crack Mr Breman\u0027s crossword within a few hours.”  The puzzle can be downloaded from Mr Breman\u0027s website, marcbreman.london.  The first 10 people to crack it were to receive a signed copy of his new book, \u0027The Foggiest Notion\u0027, which is itself based on a crossword puzzle.1 Leave after finding nothing in big rambling empty space (4,6)6 Tolerate swimming in sea that tastes of tarragon (9)14 Round a great deal, turning out hit that\u0027s within hearing (7)15 Some heat to cook rice, getting address in Spain back (7)16 People fail to perform with that woman\u0027s leaderless energy (8)18 American uncle has left grand in Wimbledon (4)21 Endless call to finish measurement system in the tube (6)23 Tune has audible pause and it slows down (3,5)27 Car blockade has husband running from Bonn to Berlin (8)29 Head of casting is apparent during whole film (4)31 Force redhead to leave ales out for sugar supplier...

Because crypto-assets know no boundaries, international cooperation will be essential.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

It bases this scenario on the Prime Minister’s recent Mansion House speech which outlined the Brexit she hopes to deliver.This would mean leaving the single market and customs union whilst maintaining access to EU markets with minimal tariff and non-tariff barriers. It would also include the flexibility to erge from Brussels regulations, negotiate trading relationships with other non-EU countries and implement restrictions on immigration.How cognitive psychology makes sense of the Brexit voteSterling falls back from post-Brexit referendum highBrexit: Commonwealth trade plans mocked as a \u0027fool\u0027s errand\u0027 by MPHow we can make the government give everyone a vote on the Brexit dealThe research estimates that this outcome would leave the country better off than a no-deal Brexit but worse off than under the “Norway model” or under an average free-trade agreement such as the one Canada has with the EU.The Norway model, in which the UK would stay in the single market and adhere to EU rules and regulations but leave the customs union, would have a negative fiscal impact of £262m per week while the Canada option would cost around £877m per week, Mr Portes finds. The figures are the equivalent of  9 per cent and 31 per cent of the current NHS budget respectively. A no-deal Brexit in which the UK trades with the EU under World Trade Organisation terms is estimated to cost £1.25bn per week. No scenario is more beneficial than staying in the EU.The analysis takes into account the benefits from lower financial contributions to the EU budget and a new trade deal with the US as well as costs arising from new customs controls, tariffs, and reduced migration. A survey conducted as part of the research found that 72 per cent of Leave voters thought that £615m a week would be too high a price to pay for a bespoke Brexit deal, while 78 per cent said it was worse than they had hoped for when they cast their vote in June 2016.Among all EU referendum voters polled, just 23 per cent said they thought the estimated cost would be worth paying.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Selfridges\u0027 Bobble 550ml filtered water bottle costs £12.95 and includes a replaceable carbon filter that filters water as you drink, removing chlorine and organic contaminants in the process. You can buy it from selfridges.comIt is estimated that the UK throws away around 2.5bn disposable coffee cups a year and almost all are incinerated, exported or sent to landfill because their plastic lining makes them expensive to recycle. The new Latte Levy in the UK means there will now be a 25p charge on every disposable coffee cup bought by consumers. Pret A Manger announced that it will double its discount to 50p in an effort to reduce waste. By swapping to a reusable cup you will be able to help cut the cost of disposable coffee cups.

You can purchase them from Bali Boo on Amazon.co.uk for £13.99.“The main issue is that effectively the price per tonne to the waste management companies received for cups has meant it hasn’t been economic for them to take the cups to the paper mills – there hasn’t been enough profit it in it  for them,” he said.“We realised that was actually the hurdle we had to overcome if we were going to cut through this, and as the market leader we felt we should.”To address the shortfall, Costa Coffee has agreed to pay an additional £75 per tonne to waste management companies, making it economically viable to transport cups to the paper mill.In doing so, it predicts the number of cups recycled at the UK’s facilities will rise from 14 million cups to 100 million this year.UK set to throw away a third more disposable cupsThe company has entered into a partnership with five national waste collectors – Veolia, Biffa, Suez, Grundon and First Mile – that between them cover public spaces across the UK including hospitals, universities and transport hubs.The coffee giant is also working with paper mills to ensure their products are recycled effectively. James Cropper, for example, has plans to “upcycle” 500 million cups a year to create plastic-free packaging.“We’ve developed these processes over a number of years because we recognise the need for brands to consider their packaging design and explore plastic-free alternatives,” said Phil Wild, chief executive officer at James Cropper.By building more partnerships with waste contractors in every region, Costa intends to hit its half a billion mark within two years.With one report predicting the number of takeaway drink cups thrown away in the UK is set to rise by a third by 2030, and the government recently failing to back a “latte levy” to discourage cup use, it falls to businesses to act on the huge amount of waste from their products.Commenting on the announcement Environment Minister Therese Coffey, said: “Congratulations Costa on taking this significant step to help coffee lovers do the right thing and increase recycling. We all have a responsibility to our environment and this is a significant step by a British business which should dramatically increase the number of disposable coffee cups we recycle in this country.“We want to help companies become plastic free and through our 25 Year Environment Plan we are putting in place the ambitions to encourage all of us to play our part in ending the scourge of plastic waste in our natural environment.”    What do people think of Starbucks charging 5p for coffee cups?“We’re hoping that via this announcement our other competitors will come on board with us as well – we can’t see why they wouldn’t,” said Mr Paul.Concern about plastic waste,and the harm it is causing to the marine environment in particular, has led to many communities up and down the UK attempting to eradicate single-use plastics such as disposable coffee cups altogether.As awareness has grown among the public, companies have felt the pressure to act on their disposable coffee cup waste.  The Independent’s Cut the Cup Waste campaign has found that the majority of the British public would support a 25p charge on disposable coffee cups, investigated the use of china cups in major coffee chains and featured calls on businesses and government to take responsibility for their waste.“What the campaigns have done is increase customer focus on this area – quite rightly – and it has actually been helpful for us because it has enabled us to move quicker with some of the waste management firms than we would have done otherwise,” said Mr Paul.“It’s helping us do the right thing.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling: Warning of imminent slump against euro and dollarSterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Selfridges\u0027 Bobble 550ml filtered water bottle costs £12.95 and includes a replaceable carbon filter that filters water as you drink, removing chlorine and organic contaminants in the process. You can buy it from selfridges.comIt is estimated that the UK throws away around 2.5bn disposable coffee cups a year and almost all are incinerated, exported or sent to landfill because their plastic lining makes them expensive to recycle. The new Latte Levy in the UK means there will now be a 25p charge on every disposable coffee cup bought by consumers. Pret A Manger announced that it will double its discount to 50p in an effort to reduce waste. By swapping to a reusable cup you will be able to help cut the cost of disposable coffee cups. This Keep Cup Brew, cork edition, travel cup in Fika is just one of the many available to purchase.

These straws are handmade in Bali and crafted by local balinese artisans. Made of organic and natural materials they are the best eco-friendly alternative to plastic, steel or glass straws. You can purchase them from Bali Boo on Amazon.co.uk for £13.99.“The main issue is that effectively the price per tonne to the waste management companies received for cups has meant it hasn’t been economic for them to take the cups to the paper mills – there hasn’t been enough profit it in it  for them,” he said.“We realised that was actually the hurdle we had to overcome if we were going to cut through this, and as the market leader we felt we should.”To address the shortfall, Costa Coffee has agreed to pay an additional £75 per tonne to waste management companies, making it economically viable to transport cups to the paper mill.In doing so, it predicts the number of cups recycled at the UK’s facilities will rise from 14 million cups to 100 million this year.UK set to throw away a third more disposable cupsThe company has entered into a partnership with five national waste collectors – Veolia, Biffa, Suez, Grundon and First Mile – that between them cover public spaces across the UK including hospitals, universities and transport hubs.The coffee giant is also working with paper mills to ensure their products are recycled effectively. James Cropper, for example, has plans to “upcycle” 500 million cups a year to create plastic-free packaging.“We’ve developed these processes over a number of years because we recognise the need for brands to consider their packaging design and explore plastic-free alternatives,” said Phil Wild, chief executive officer at James Cropper.By building more partnerships with waste contractors in every region, Costa intends to hit its half a billion mark within two years.With one report predicting the number of takeaway drink cups thrown away in the UK is set to rise by a third by 2030, and the government recently failing to back a “latte levy” to discourage cup use, it falls to businesses to act on the huge amount of waste from their products.Commenting on the announcement Environment Minister Therese Coffey, said: “Congratulations Costa on taking this significant step to help coffee lovers do the right thing and increase recycling. We all have a responsibility to our environment and this is a significant step by a British business which should dramatically increase the number of disposable coffee cups we recycle in this country.“We want to help companies become plastic free and through our 25 Year Environment Plan we are putting in place the ambitions to encourage all of us to play our part in ending the scourge of plastic waste in our natural environment.”    What do people think of Starbucks charging 5p for coffee cups?“We’re hoping that via this announcement our other competitors will come on board with us as well – we can’t see why they wouldn’t,” said Mr Paul.Concern about plastic waste,and the harm it is causing to the marine environment in particular, has led to many communities up and down the UK attempting to eradicate single-use plastics such as disposable coffee cups altogether.As awareness has grown among the public, companies have felt the pressure to act on their disposable coffee cup waste.  The Independent’s Cut the Cup Waste campaign has found that the majority of the British public would support a 25p charge on disposable coffee cups, investigated the use of china cups in major coffee chains and featured calls on businesses and government to take responsibility for their waste.“What the campaigns have done is increase customer focus on this area – quite rightly – and it has actually been helpful for us because it has enabled us to move quicker with some of the waste management firms than we would have done otherwise,” said Mr Paul.“It’s helping us do the right thing.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling: Warning of imminent slump against euro and dollarSterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The situation is made more urgent by the fact that the UK cannot even begin to negotiate replacement deals with other countries until it has left the EU.“It has become clear that negotiating our trade framework after Brexit will be a complex and time-consuming matter,” the MEPs wrote in the letter.“As political representatives of farmers and food exporters we are deeply concerned that the underestimation of the difficulty of this process should not impact negatively on them and hence on British trade.Molly Scott Cato, a Green MEP representing the strongly rural and agricultural South West, and one of the letter’s signatories, said: “Liam Fox’s infamous claim that securing a trade deal with the EU post Brexit would be the ‘easiest in human history’ has been exposed as total bluster and bravado. Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

russia","story":"International chemical weapons inspectors\u0026nbspfinally set to visit\u0026nbspsite of the\u0026nbspalleged attack in DoumaTheresa May has won a second symbolic vote on her decision to launch airstrikes after another day of fraught parliamentary debate on Syria.The prime minister’s advisers believe the result shows she has successfully navigated difficulties arising from her move to push ahead with a military operation without first consulting MPs.But Jeremy Corbyn used the debate to demand that the House of Commons “take back our control” of decisions to launch any military action, with a new “War Powers Act”.Theresa May says ‘element of surprise’ was crucial in Syria bombingThe development came as inspectors were set to finally make it to the site of the alleged Douma chemical weapons attack on Wednesday, with Ms May accusing Moscow of preventing the scientists from doing their work.Ahead of the Commons vote on Syria, Ms May told MPs that coming to parliament before undertaking military action would “compromise the effectiveness of our operations and safety of British servicemen and women”.She attacked the suggestion of a War Powers Act, claiming it would remove “vital flexibility” from situations which are “by definition unpredictable”.She went on: “Making it unlawful for Her Majesty’s Government to undertake any such military intervention without a vote would seriously compromise our national security, our national interests, and the lives of British citizens at home and abroad.Syria bombing: EU ‘understands’ recent airstrikes but calls for ‘urgent’ resumption of peace talks“And, for as long as I’m prime minister, that will never be allowed to happen.”She concluded by saying that after two days of debate no one could doubt her commitment to be held accountable by parliament, and also that the tone of the debate had been supportive to the strikes.Chemical weapons inspectors have entered Douma, Syrian media says‘Very likely’ evidence disappearing from Douma site, France saysCorbyn leads debate in Parliament on Syria strikes- as it happenedMay defends Syria air strikes amid criticism over lack of voteTrump halts plans for new sanctions on Russia If May wants to help Syria she should accept more refugeesA vote related to the Syria action was already won by the government on Monday, though it was not on a substantive motion – one that explicitly seeks to approve the action or not.The motion of Tuesday’s vote, which stated the Commons has “considered parliament’s rights in relation to the approval of military action by British forces”, was also neutral in tone.But Mr Corbyn called on his own MPs to vote against it, despite Labour having called the debate, to show opposition over how they believe the government sidelined parliament in relation to the military action.Before the motion was passed by 317 to 256, Mr Corbyn’s speech was met with bad tempered heckling from Tory MPs, who consistently tried to intervene while the Labour leader was talking.Kenneth Clarke criticises Theresa May for failure to consult parliament over Syria bombingSpeaker John Bercow gave warnings to Conservative backbenchers such as Alec Shelbrooke and Mark Harper during the course of the debate.Outlining his proposed War Powers Act, the Labour leader said it was for the Commons “to take matters into its own hands and take back our control”.He added: “There’s no more serious issue in decisions made by parliament on matters of war and peace, and the government taking planned military action.“That convention was established in 2003, it was enshrined in Cabinet in 2011, and the then the foreign secretary gave every indication that he supported the principle of parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary approval of such a major step.“I’ve outlined the caveats that are there in a case of overriding emergency, but I do think it is very important that the House of Commons, as one of the oldest parliaments in the world, holds the government to account.”Earlier in the day the prime minister accused Moscow of preventing inspectors for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) from reaching Douma.Russian officials at OPCW headquarters in The Hague later said arrangements were being made for the inspectors to travel to the site on Wednesday.Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has flatly denied that Russia had “tampered” with the evidence, and insisted there is no proof that chemical weapons had even been used in Douma.Douma chemical attack: Syria war in picturesDouma chemical

dangerous development”.Speaking at a press conference in Dublin, Yury Filatov suggested the strikes were intended to impede the investigation so nobody would know the truth, adding that experts have not yet found any traces of chlorine or any other toxic agents.“As far as we can see there was no attack,” he said. “Not a single local resident was able to confirm that a chemical attack had actually taken place.”Mr Filatov said the suspected chemical attack had “definitely been staged”, and that the images had been “fabricated”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They are part of us and I want to be absolutely clear that we have no intention of asking anyone to leave who has the right to remain here, Ms May told MPs.For those who have mistakenly received letters challenging them I want to apologise them and I want to say sorry to anyone who has been caused confusion and anxiety as a result of this.Theresa May apologises to those affected by Windrush deportation errorsThe majority of citizens who arrived before 1971 will have the documentation to prove their status, but the small number who do not will receive urgent help from the Home Office, she said.Thousands of people are believed to lack the documents they need to prove their immigration, under the “hostile environment” for suspected illegal immigrants introduced by Ms May when she was home secretary.Affected citizens will not be “left out of pocket” while they establish their credentials to meet new government rules, the prime minister has promised.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

They said if Florida were a separate country, it would be the world’s 26th largest carbon polluter.“The Sunshine State gets less than one per cent of its energy from solar power,” said Oscar Psychas, 20, from Gainesville, the oldest of the plaintiffs.Speaking at a press conference in the state’s capital, Tallahassee, he added: “Last spring I walked to 280 miles from my home in Gainesville to Tallahassee to demand our state’s leaders protect our wild places. During my walk I saw climate change firsthand during the hottest spring ever recorded in Florida and forests dying from sea level rise along the Gulf Coast. “I’m back in Tallahassee today because I’ve seen that when our leaders destroy a stable climate, everything we care about — our wild places, our communities, our basic rights to life, liberty, and property – is endangered.”Security of supply, jobs and climate change: Jacinda Ahern lays out why she is banning further oil exploration in New ZealandGuy Burns, who is serving as lead counsel for the young plaintiffs said that Florida had an amazing opportunity to make use of its renewable energy sources, that included solar, wave and wind. Instead, he claimed the state government had promoted the use of fossil fuels. “It is the responsibility of the state to uphold the constitution, and these young people have a fundamental right to a stable climate system,” he said.The civil lawsuit is not seeking financial damages. Rather, it wants the court to order a science-based climate recovery plan and for the state government to acknowledge climate change is real and that climate change impacts are harming the youth plaintiffs. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesTurkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces early presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, 2018, at the Presidential Palace, in Ankara.

He couldn’t do it by himself, so another gentleman came over and helped to get her back in the plane, and they got her.” Passengers gave CPR to Ms Riordan, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, while others struggled to plug the window as pilots began a rapid descent before performing an emergency landing in Philadelphia.Passengers did “some pretty amazing things under some pretty difficult circumstances”, said Philadelphia fire commissioner Adam Thiel. Ms Riordan later died from her injuries. She is the first person to die in an accident involving a US airline in nine years.Her Facebook page shows she was married to husband Michael and had two children.In a statement issued to Texas TV news station WFAA, her family said: “Jennifer’s vibrancy, passion and love infused our community and reached across our country.

Others wrote “#Iambreakingthelaw”.Weibo, which is similar to Twitter in format, appeared to then ban the hashtags and deleted many of the 150,000-plus comments related to them.The company’s Nasdaq shares fell in value on Friday amid the controversy.In an update on Sunday, Weibo said the “clean-up” would “no longer target gay content”.Censors will “primarily focus on pornographic and violent material,” the social network said, adding: “Thank you everyone for your discussions and suggestions.” The company had previously said it was acting in accordance with China’s cybersecurity laws.The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, has not commented.But the People’s Daily, the official paper of China’s ruling Communist Party, also appeared to criticise Weibo in an editorial on Sunday. “Intellectually speaking, there should be a consensus around respecting other people’s sexual orientation,” the column said, adding that comparing homosexuality to pornography and violence and regarding it as “abnormal” would go down badly with the public. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesTurkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces early presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, 2018, at the Presidential Palace, in Ankara.

However, a traditional, conservative preference for conventional marriage and childbearing creates barriers for LGBT+ people. Following Weibo’s initial announcement on Friday, more than a million users have viewed hashtags in support of LGBT+ rights.Hua Zile, the founder of Voice for China LGBT, Weibo’s first LGBT-themed account, said he was encouraged by the widespread anger over the site’s censorship plan. “The response shows that we LGBT people in China are slowly realising our rights,” Mr Hua said. “Gay people who would not have spoken out years ago are now letting their voices be heard.” He said a Weibo manager had told him to stop posting while the “clean-up” was taking place.China’s Weibo will soon overtake TwitterHe complied, and his announcement that Voice for China LGBT would be going on hiatus was shared nearly 40,000 times. After Weibo’s u-turn, Mr Hua called on the firm to apologise to the LGBT+ community. “Like China, which has developed so quickly in such a short time, sex education in the country is a work in progress,” he said. On Sunday, an LGBT+ group of more than 100 people took part in a marathon in the city of Nanjing, holding rainbow flags to raise awareness of gay rights.The group had planned to take part in the marathon months in advance, but its organiser, Lucas Chen, said Weibo’s announcement gave it “added significance”. The main objective of joining the marathon was to “help everyone courageously come out of the closet,” Mr Chen said. “So it was meaningful that people online were also bravely speaking out and showing that they were not defeated by negativity.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
