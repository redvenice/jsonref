The photographs, captured by photographer and explorer Gianluca Chiodini, 41, from Rome, Italy, only hint to the New Guinea tribe\u0027s dark, violent history (Pictured: Young members of the Asmat tribe)         The Asmat people spent centuries hunting down their enemies and removing their heads, sometimes transforming their decapitated skulls into pillows (Pictured: A child in a sea shell hat)         The tribe is said to have \u0027officially\u0027 turned its back on headhunting in the 1990s in favour of a quieter, more peaceful life of woodcarving and creating \u0027legendary\u0027 handicrafts         \u0027I have always really wanted to go to Papua, in particular the Asmat area,\u0027 said Mr Chiodini, who works as a manager for an energy company\u0027Asmat handicraft is legendary of course and a big reason for my visit. Another was the beautiful body and facial decorations on display but most of all I yearned to explore a tribe which is close to world limits\u0027.The tribe, which still remains relatively isolated from the modern world, formed a community organisation, the Lembaga Musyawarah Adat Asmat, in 2000.  This represents the needs and interests of the tribe, and promotes self-reliance, self-governance, and sustainable economic development.The Asmat people became infamous in 1961 after they were accused of the murder of Michael Rockefeller, who was the son of then-New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller.              The tribe, which still remains relatively isolated from the modern world, formed a community organisation, the Lembaga Musyawarah Adat Asmat, in 2000 (Left: A group of tribesmen and right: sacred wooden masks)         The tribe did not only hunt for skulls but also worshipped them, and believed that when they killed a man and ate him, they took his power and became him         The heads of the deceased were stripped of the brain and the eyes and nasal parts were closed up in order to prevent evil spirits to enter or exit the body\u0027You really need to want to go to Asmat, because it takes several days to get there, you need to sleep in tents in their longhouse, to navigate in narrow rivers and they are not that friendly\u0027, said Mr Chiodini.\u0027I knew the Rockefeller story before I got there, I was also a little bit scared because you cannot know what you will face when you arrive in the area.\u0027Officially headhunting ceased in the 1990s. What I can say is that Asmat are relatively isolated and their most important cultural traditions are still strong - you can feel it as you explore the area.\u0027The tribe did not only hunt for skulls, they also worshipped them. The heads of the deceased were stripped of the brain and the eyes and nasal parts were closed up in order to prevent evil spirits to enter or exit the body.          Two Asmat tribesmen exhale smoke in a small hut while wearing elaborately decorated feathered hats and body paint         Children were also covered in white paint within the tribe, which became infamous for its headhunting practices in the 20th century         Dozens of tribesmen sit crossed legged for a community meeting of the Asmat people, some with white paint across their bodies and heads         A group of tribesmen head across the coastal waters of Papua on their own hand-hewn canoes near to the isolated village         The Asmat people became infamous in 1961 after they were accused of the murder of Michael Rockefeller (Pictured in New Guinea)Skulls that were modified and decorated were then displayed by the Asmat in an honourable place in their homes. The tribe were said to believe that when they killed a man and ate him, they took his power and became him.Each of the thousands of tribesmen was named after someone deceased, or after a killed enemy. It is, however, believed headhunting ceased in the 1990s when Catholic missionaries suppressed the practice.          Pictured: Italian photographer Gianluca Chiodini, 41, who captured the striking photographsTheir biggest alleged scalp was Rockefeller, who had been exploring New Guinea in 1961 in search of treasures to bring home and put on display in New York City.He visited Asmat during the trip - a region he described as \u0027wild and somehow more remote country than what I have ever seen before\u0027 - where he had a pragmatic relationship with the local tribes. But as his boat approached what is now Papua New Guinea on November 19, a sudden gust of wind churned the water and capsized Rockefeller\u0027s boat. Despite being 10 miles from dry land, he attempted to swim to shore.In 2014, Carl Hoffman, a reporter for National Geographic, alleged in his book Savage Harvest that he believed Rockefeller was murdered and eaten by the Asmat people. According to years of research, the Oil Standard heir had managed to make it back to the island but was confronted by a bank of Asmat tribespeople who were fishing the waters.But the tale didn\u0027t stop Mr Chiodini from visiting the area. The photographer recalls speaking to the tribal elders, who were old enough to have partaken in their tribe\u0027s history of cannibalism and headhunting, and being distracted by the notion as he asked the ancient warriors to pose for a photo.\u0027Being able to capture people in their environment and show what life is like in these places is a big part of what I enjoy about travel photography,\u0027 he said.\u0027In other worlds, connecting with locals, even if sometimes just with non-verbal language.

Interview by Felix PettyMy first game at White Hart Lane was Tottenham v Wimbledon on Saturday 10 November 1990. We won the game 4–2. I sat in Park Lane watching a Spurs side featuring Gazza, Lineker, Mabbutt, Walsh … But my love for Tottenham started long before that. We all have our stories as to why we support the club. Mine might be a little different to most, having grown up in Denmark.The first ever game I remember watching on TV was the 1978 World Cup final between Argentina and Holland. I was six years old and watched the game with my parents. I remember taking an instant liking to the Argentina kits, the blue and white stripes and the black shorts. I was blown away by the atmosphere and celebrations and instantly fell in love with football. After that summer I started following the English games on TV and as the recent World Cup winners Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa had signed for Spurs, I decided Tottenham was going to be my team. I watched as many games as I could on TV before I finally moved to London in 1993 and was from then on finally able to visit White Hart Lane on a regular basis.I’ve been supporting Tottenham most of my life and seen us in good and bad times. Seen players and managers come and go, and it can be frustrating, even heartbreaking, when they leave for another team. Sometimes it can feel like there’s little loyalty in football. One day you are Spurs, the next day you can go play for a rival. The focus is always on the players and the manager. I was interested in making a project about the fans. The fans never switch allegiances, they are here forever and I felt that needed to be documented and celebrated.I started bringing my camera to the games and photographed the atmosphere on the streets and in the pubs before and after. It ended up growing into an obsession, and after three years I realised that I was beginning to document a piece of our history – the last seasons at White Hart Lane. I decided that our last game at White Hart Lane should be the endpoint of this project. I went to, and photographed, over 100 home and away games between 2013 and 2017.I wanted to capture different generations of fans, the camaraderie, the banter, the songs in the pubs, the madness. Travelling up and down the country and the long away trips in Europe. I wasn’t interested in making a chronological “football fan” book covering all the games with numerous pictures on each page. I wanted the book to have some artistic merit in terms of photography. I am interested in people and I’ve always been more interested in photography that is open-ended, pictures that are suggestive and open to interpretation, rather than pictures that are descriptive.The Arsenal derbies are always memorable, something every fan looks forward to. It’s an early start and you can feel the tension and excitement in the atmosphere all over north London. I also used to love the trips to Upton Park, which are now sadly also part of history. The European away trips are fantastic. There is something special about going abroad with Tottenham. Being in a different country, putting our flags and banners up and taking over a pub with all the familiar faces. The last game at White Hart Lane was emotional and beautiful. When we beat Manchester City away in 2016, when Eriksen scored the winner in the 83rd minute, and of course our 3-1 win against Real Madrid at Wembley, these were all very special moments.There’s something about going to all those games, travelling home and away, which forms bonds between people, and over the past five years I have met so many fantastic characters and heard many Tottenham stories. There is something fascinating about meeting and talking to lifelong fans, those who have been there since the glory days – there’s a real link to the history of the club in their memories. It’s important to memorialise that.I was interested in capturing characters, emotions and expressions and also the dynamics of the group. I kept an instinctive approach throughout and often shot from the hip. Nothing was planned or staged. It was all about capturing those little moments – a feeling that could so often get lost if I’d spent time framing the shots.It definitely helped being a Spurs boy, but you don’t just turn up and get invited in and start taking pictures. In the beginning there were certainly a few people who questioned what I was doing pointing a camera in their face. I knew from the beginning that I had to take my time. It was important for me to get to know people first, find out what they are doing and just go with the flow. It might sound like a cliché, but you can’t make images happen when you want them to – the images will come to you. It’s a little bit like fishing – sometimes you catch something and sometimes you come home empty-handed.I like using my camera as a tool to meet other people. It can help break down boundaries. I always treat everyone with respect – if they didn’t want to be photographed I wouldn’t photograph them. I am always modest and interested in what other people are doing and thinking. I take better pictures when I feel a connection with others. Once you are accepted and you are part of the same dynamic you feel that you belong to something special and it becomes easier to take pictures.Can’t Smile Without You by Martin Andersen is published by AMS and available at https:www.shop.martinandersenproductscant-smile-without-you.

The gentleman in the foreground, Joe Wrenn, organises this group ride every fall in the hilly terrain to the north of the Mississippi delta. I’ve been going for a few years.Trail rides are universal in the American cowboy tradition. In other states you might find thousands of people on a single ride. Here there were about 100 people, many riding, and others, who you can’t see in the photo, on dirt bikes and all-terrain vehicles.Most of the delta region is completely flat. Up here, though, are rolling hills, which is where the group gets its name. The ride wasn’t following a trail – part of it was along an old logging road. We had all stopped for a break. People were relaxing, playing music and then, when we started back out, Joe drove the truck up alongside these three horses. I shot I don’t know how many frames. I remember feeling so excited at getting both Joe and the kids on their horses silhouetted against that beautiful, late-afternoon sun bursting through. That is Joe’s grandson on the first horse.Elsewhere, I have photographed a great-grandmother who had just turned 92 – her husband, now deceased, was one of the first cowboys to start organising these rides in the delta. And I’ve photographed little kids, maybe four or five, riding around a horse show.Being a Delta Hill Rider is like being a member of a biker club. They have been riding horses for generations, and they take great pride in passing down the skills – riding, grooming, competing – from one generation to the next. The riders go to R\u0026ampB clubs dressed as cowboys and the DJ will play cowboy songs and zydeco music.My interest started by chance, in December 2016, when I was working as staff photographer at the university in Cleveland, Mississippi. I stumbled across a small group of riders during the annual parade and asked one of the riders if I could come and photograph where they keep their horses.

Its walls are sprayed with graffiti and plastered with stickers, and the windows are blacked out.But listen closely and you can hear the windows rattle to the sound of drums and electric guitars from dozens of rock, funk, blues and jazz bands.Diogo Azevedo, singer of the thrash metal band Jarda, is one of an estimated 300 musicians and artists who helped turn Centro Comercial Stop – known as Stop – into a unique, and controversial, music studio complex.“It’s part of the underground scene in Porto,” Azevedo says, attractive to its bohemian occupants, but a headache for city hall.Porto’s authorities claim the building is illegal: it was never intended to be a music studio, they say, and it fails to comply with modern safety requirements.The musicians feel differently. For the past 10 years they have battled to keep the building open, citing its cultural relevancy at a time when locals feel they’ve been priced out of the city by the ever-increasing demand from tourism.“We have so many friends here,” Azevedo says. “We rehearse, jam. It ends up being a waste if this place was demolished to be one of many other hotels in Porto.”The car park first became a mall in 1982, one of dozens that sprouted like mushrooms across the city following the collapse of the Second Republic. Locals flocked to the cinema and top-floor dance hall. But new, larger, out-of-town complexes in the 1990s saw many of Porto’s businesses, customers and residents relocate to the suburbs. Shutters were pulled down over large areas of the city.Helena Fernandes remembers her first visit to the abandoned mall. “It broke my heart,” she says. “I saw how shopping was in the golden days and this was empty.”Hernandes, 44, is president of Batucada Radical, a Brazilian street percussion band. “We came here because nobody wanted us in other places,” she says. “We are very loud. We stayed for six months rehearsing in one place, and people asked us to get out. We were like nomads.”In Stop they saw an opportunity. They negotiated cheap rates and, along with other musicians, transformed the storefronts in amateur rehearsal and recording studios.“It was crazy. There were lots of heavy metal bands that started – rock, punk. The building trembled. It’s weird because your neighbour is the one who blows out your ears. You get louder, then your neighbour gets louder – it was like a war. Who plays louder!”Many of the musical groups are collectives – Hernandes’ began with 20 members but now has more than 100. The venue, she says, has been “a turning point” for the group. “With rents as they are now, it would be impossible to get a place like this,” she says.The artists’ appetite for loud music, late-night drinking and in some cases antisocial behaviour have somewhat strained relations with the local community.“It was like a Noah’s Ark where all the animals were inside,” says Jorge Prendas, a coordinator at the music venue Casa da Música, which rented two studios in Stop. “Police went there three or four times to close it. They had a very good argument: it was not safe.”But authorities couldn’t close it, because of a quirk: the building has never had an owner, so legal responsibility fell on the dozens of inidual landlords of the various retail spaces. The sales of these shopfronts, however, were unregulated, and authorities in many cases don’t know the owners, let alone how to track them down.Without clear ownership or maintenance, the building slid into disrepair. The escalator and air conditioning clunked to a halt, toilets were badly damaged and water leaked from ceilings. To improve acoustics, musicians glued cardboard egg cartons and sponges to walls, but this only amplified the fire risk – in a building with no fire exits or sprinklers, at a time when unsafe electrical usage in the building was surging.The group was called StopEstra (from “Stop” and “orchestra”), and for its launch it staged a 21-band performance across the city, performing nonstop for six hours before convening at Casa da Música the next night as a unified 100-piece rock band.The British composer and director Tim Steiner, who conducted the group that evening, says the experience was “an extraordinary thing”.“I’ve been working for 30 years in community-grounded music projects around the world and there’s nothing like StopEstra”says Steiner, a former professor at the London Guildhall School of Music. “There was a real understanding between all the musicians – a lot of respect – and a sense of experimentation and exploration of what you could do when you have a large group of rock musicians together.”The megagroup performed seven more times over the next six years, including as the opening act for the first Porto edition of the Primavera Sound music festival in 2012, and had appeared to secure the building’s future.A fire in 2017, however, gutted four studios and once again drew the attention of city hall. A new organisation, Alma Stop, fronted by the Portuguese singer Manel Cruz, was formed to defend the building’s case – but it was a hard sell after the fire.“The biggest problem is the musicians,” Cruz says. “It’s very difficult for them to believe the truth. People can die here, we have to understand that.”Other musicians have moved on to more professional digs. João Brandão used to rehearse here as a teenager, but has gone on to establish Plataforma Campanhã, a €1.7m (£1.45m) production hub with music studios, production rooms and a training academy for studio engineers and production staff.“It’s the same concept” as Stop, he says. “We wanted to get together and share ideas and work together but in a more professional space. We knew that people needed a good studio in Portugal – a professional studio with good-quality equipment, good acoustics.City hall is much more supportive of the new, slicker venture, leasing a room for its vinyl library – 35,000 LPs donated by two radio stations – with plans for community events and podcasts.Guilherme Blanc, head of contemporary art and film at the Porto Municipality for Culture, hopes Stop could soon do the same, as part of the city’s multimillion-euro investment in culture.“The space doesn’t follow the necessary rules for public use. It’s not a public building – it’s an illegal building,” he says. “But what we want is to save the building for its current use, and that’s our goal.To Mendes, Stop is about what Porto means to its residents – particularly its poorer artists and musicians – at a time when the city is growing. “Tourism is good,” he says, “it gives money, great industry, businesses around it, but we must draw a line. The centre of Porto is not for the people of Porto any more. Stop is a privileged place.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a37537847fe35374c829c1d127cd926d528f361/2_0_1087_652/master/1087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ae8967cf98627f764cd20778fbdf78a","title":"living through endless weeks of dirty air it does your head in and your lungs","story":"I wake up at night thinking the house is on fire, and I struggle to breathe.

Misleading bar charts, selective publication, dubious tactical voting recommendations and outright fake research are all in the news, and the mantra “trust no poll” is resounding on social media. Questions are understandably being asked about the contributions of the media, political parties and electoral regulators to the poor level of public discussion of public opinion. But I think the polling industry also has questions to answer.The best set of principles for judging whether statistics are being communicated in a trustworthy fashion come from the philosopher Onora O’Neill. She says that statisticians should make their work accessible, intelligible, usable and assessable.How does the polling industry do according to these standards? YouGov’s recent MRP poll (it stands for multilevel regression and post-stratification) can serve as a high-water mark. As a piece of statistics communication it surpasses the rest of the polling published so far in this campaign: it comes with a nice website, accessibly formatted results and a detailed document explaining its methodology. Yet according to O’Neill’s criteria, even this analysis falls short.YouGov may have released constituency-level results, but other, more important, parts of its analysis remain inaccessible. The company has not shared the data that went into its analysis, or the code that implements it, so it is impossible to check it for errors or compare YouGov’s approach against alternatives.The explanatory material on the website is helpful, but this isn’t enough to make YouGov’s analysis acceptably intelligible. It doesn’t spell out how exactly its models used demographic traits to predict voting behaviour – a crucial part of multiple regression – or what assumptions it made about how many people have all those traits in order to carry out its post-stratification. Absolute clarity is important here because, like other statistical techniques, multilevel regression and post-stratification are highly sensitive to modelling choices where there is no obvious right answer. Before the 2016 US election the New York Times asked four respected teams of pollsters to predict the Trump-Clinton spread in Florida based on the same opinion poll. The results ranged from Trump ahead by one to Clinton ahead by four. None of the analyses were bad, they just made different judgment calls. This shows that in order to understand any opinion poll analysis, we need to know exactly what choices the pollsters made at every stage.How might people use YouGov’s analysis? Well, many people have probably seen it as a way to predict constituency results in the election. Unfortunately, this isn’t possible: the results are merely snapshots of the week of 20-27 November, when the polling took place, and do not try to capture how public opinion will change between then and election day. This is a big problem because there aren’t many sources of information about constituency-level public opinion, so people are bound to be tempted to misuse YouGov’s results. It may caution against using its results as forecasts, but that’s no excuse for putting such easily misinterpreted numbers into the public sphere in the first place.As for O’Neill’s last requirement, YouGov’s analysis is impossible to assess. The natural way to test its model would be to use it to predict unseen survey responses, but with the data and code kept out of reach, no one outside the company can do this.It’s clear that even this poll fails to meet the standards of statistics communication. So what could YouGov and the rest of the polling industry do to be more trustworthy?The best thing would be for the industry to make all its analysis reproducible by sharing its data and code online, following the standard practices of open-source software development. That would enable any interested person with a computer to run the same analysis. It would then be possible to catch polling firms’ errors by picking through their code, and to assess their models against fresh data. Perhaps members of the public could even build on the polling industry’s work to produce forecasts that people can actually use, taking into account how public opinion changes over time. In short, opinion polling would become more trustworthy.Thanks to modern software, there is no technical barrier to making opinion poll analysis reproducible only a minimal amount of extra work would be involved. The objection I anticipate from the polling industry is that its analyses depend on secret proprietary data that is simply too valuable to share. Valuable to whom? It’s mainly valuable to the polling companies themselves, helping them differentiate themselves from their competitors while also providing a handy excuse for ducking some scrutiny. But is that really worth sacrificing our trust in opinion polls?It’s not surprising the public discussion about opinion polls is in such a bad state, when even the best polls fail to meet reasonable standards of trustworthy statistics communication. The polling industry benefits greatly from the exposure it gains during election campaigns, which amounts to free advertising. In return it should be required to provide reproducible analysis, even if that means sacrificing a little secrecy.• Teddy Groves is a statistician at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Centre for Biosustainability"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81b1f38895d36cfea1df6e98f8a1a5a03f19af88/0_209_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b771203290f015f5e538e8269cdee96","title":"what is an app i honestly have no idea","story":"I’m trying to get my dad to use his iPhone.

I’ve blamed the way they stab so desperately at their phones, but I read somewhere that it’s because older people have drier skin on their hands, which makes them less touchscreen-capable.Either way, my dad’s particular issue is kind of conceptual.

Then, a month or so later, the same question again, delivered with ever more brow-furrowing angst: “Ade, please can you explain, what is an app?” Whatever I say doesn’t seem to help the poor chap.Google certainly doesn’t help with this, serving up a definition that, for my dad, prompts as many questions as it answers: “Simply put, an app is a type of software that allows you to perform specific tasks. Applications for desktop or laptop computers are sometimes called desktop applications, while those for mobile devices are called mobile apps. When you open an application, it runs inside the operating system until you close it.” I haven’t even shared this “explanation” with him yet. There’s no point.I’ve tried everything. I have sought to work up a decent analogy, but without success. Getting him to think of his record player as a kind of app to play his records didn’t work.

Experts say the district’s “Data Deletion Week” may be the first of its kind in the country.It’s not exactly an accident that schools in Montgomery county, in the suburbs of Washington DC, are leading the way on privacy protections for kids. The large school district is near the headquarters of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency. It’s a place where many federal employees, lawyers, and security experts send their own kids.As digital surveillance of American students expands rapidly in schools across the country, sparking new debates over tradeoffs between privacy and safety, Montgomery county is a revealing example of what protections some of the nation’s most well-informed, privacy-savvy parents think their children need.Like thousands of American public school districts, Montgomery county gives students laptops andhas hired tech companies to track students’ activities on those computers, including monitoring what they search for and what websites they visit.This digital surveillance – a booming industry – is marketed as a way to keep kids safe from school shootings and self-harm. It also generates detailed data on inidual children. Montgomery county parents fear that data might someday be used against their kids.This is not a distant worry. Teenagers are already facing consequences for private behavior online. In 2017, Harvard rescinded the admissions of at least 10 incoming students for sharing racist and obscene jokes in a private Facebook group chat. This year, Harvard rescinded an offer of admission to Kyle Kashuv, a conservative activist from Parkland, Florida, because of racist comments he had made in text messages and a shared Google Doc as a 16-year-old, a decision that sparked a heated national debate.Parents across the US told the  that they were afraid about having detailed educational data about their children – like how quickly they complete their homework – being fed into the enormous black box of the data mining industry. Companies have long gathered, traded and sold vast quantities of data on iniduals’ online behavior and consumer purchases, information that is also combined with public voter data and used to create targeted political advertising. Iniduals have little way to know how their data is shared from one company to another, and no power to prevent giant, frequent data breaches.By requiring tech companies to delete data they collect on schoolchildren once a year, parent activists in Montgomery County said, they hope to shield kids from being held accountable in adulthood for youthful mistakes, as well as to guard them from exploitation by what one parent termed “the student data surveillance industrial complex”.Montgomery county public schools tested Data Deletion Week last year and publicly launched the program this past August.While not all student data is deleted that week, the district works to clean much of students’ digital slates over the summer, including data collected by Google and by Go, which tracks students’ web searches, according to Peter Cevenini, the district’s chief technology officer.The district demands more than a vague assurance from tech companies that the data has been erased: “They send us a certification that officially confirms legally that the information has been deleted from their servers,” Cevenini said.Go has already submitted its formal certification the district is still waiting for formal certification from Google, Cevenini said.One of the parent leaders of the Data Deletion Week campaign was Bradley Shear, an attorney who specializes in social media and privacy policy. Shear said he was attending a conference for privacy law scholars in Washington a few years ago when he received a phone call from his son’s teacher informing him that the second-grader was in trouble for having Googled the song Fuck You, by CeeLo Green, on his school laptop.Shear said he was certain that his son had not searched for the song on purpose, and that the auto-complete function in Google search was to blame. But the incident prompted him to try to make sure that Go, which the school pays to monitor students’ search and website visits, would delete the data it had collected on his son.The response he eventually got from the tech company in 2017, a pledge to delete or “de-identify” his child’s data, was not enough for Shear. As a policy expert who had worked to pass social media privacy laws in states across the country, Shear said, he knew that “de-identified” data could usually be re-identified again.He decided to push for district-wide changes in how Go and other companies retain children’s data, including working to educate and organize other parents to push the school district to change its policies and require tech companies to regularly delete student data.“You don’t need to keep for ever what these kids are searching for online, or what’s in their Gchats,” Shear said.“Even when data is supposed to only be used for one purpose, it will be used for other purposes,” he added. “We don’t want any of this stuff hanging out and then being used against kids when they apply to college.”Shear met with district officials to discuss his concerns, and he soon found allies on the district’s active parent-teacher association, which has an entire committee dedicated to “safe technology” issues.One parent on the safe tech committee, who asked that her name not be used to protect her son’s privacy, had an experience similar to Shear’s.She said her then eight-year-old son typed in “save the land” when doing a book report on conservation, “and up came the Ku Klux Klan … ‘Save the land, join the Klan.’ He didn’t know what that was,” she said.When she talked to the teacher and suggested wiping the search from her son’s browser history, the teacher said that would not be possible, the parent recalled. If anyone was building a digital footprint of her son’s behavior, the parent said, there would now be a visit to a Klan site in it.“Kids are curious. They’re just going to plug in some key words thinking that they’re funny, and it just might stick,” she said.“I want my child to do whatever he wants to do with his career and his life,” said Ellen Zavian, a George Washington University law professor and another of the parent advocates. “If he wants to run for office, something he did in second grade shouldn’t hold him back. If he wants to apply for college, he should have no data that the colleges have bought that would provide a negative data point.”Even with broad parental support, demanding that companies delete student data was not a simple process, Shear said. Parents had to work with the school district to understand what the district had agreed to in its contracts with different technology companies, and to figure out if the contract language needed to be changed. The parents also wanted tech companies not simply to say they had deleted student data, but to certify that they had done so in an official letter to the district.“It was a complicated process,” Shear said. “It was not something that was so simple.”While parent fears over student data and privacy are “newer concerns” for school districts, the pushback that the district heard from a few parent activists also amounted to “kind of universal concerns”, and school officials decided to “get ahead of the game and see how we can address them”, Cevenini, the district’s chief technology officer, said.Amelia Vance, the director of education privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum, said that, as far as she is aware, Montgomery county is the only American school district to have implemented an annual Data Deletion Week, although parent activists across the country have pushed for other student privacy laws at the state level.Deleting records of students’ online behavior on a regular basis is a “fabulous” choice, Vance said, but doing it just once a year might not be frequent enough. Video surveillance footage is often deleted once a month, just long enough to be clear if there’s an incident that needs to be reviewed, she said, and a similar 30-day time period might also be appropriate for students’ online behavior.While there are good reasons for schools to monitor students’ internet usage – like making sure that “students aren’t being radicalized on YouTube” or “viewing totally inappropriate content”, Vance said, that monitoring can also be “incredibly invasive”.“It’s essentially a reflection of every aspect of kids’ lives today,” she said. “It is every question they ask in their brain and type into Google to see if there’s an answer. It’s every chat message that they type to their friends, every essay they write for English class.”But school districts also may face some barriers in developing Data Deletion Week policies, she said, including different state data retention laws, and parents’ and students’ desire to be able to save some of their school projects from frequent data purges.Shear, the attorney who led the push for Data Deletion Week, said he sees the rapid growth of the school surveillance industry as a “huge issue” and one that needed much more attention from students and their families.“Most parents don’t understand these issues until something happens,” he said. “You don’t really care about something until you’re discriminated against, or until you lose out to another person based on something you might never even have thought of.”The Montgomery county parent activists acknowledged that their push to change their district’s policies benefited from the expertise of the Washington-area parents involved, which included not only attorneys but people with expertise in security, privacy, and politics.Having that kind of expertise behind a parent privacy campaign “is unusual”, Zavian said. “But it doesn’t mean that other communities can’t pull on those resources. They have them. They just have to find them. It may take a little longer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/091dbac86634562a9353ea6f3cfefcc982ff21a5/0_133_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=195e7d8a0d559b4e19862d72e05171e4","title":"the struggle for sitkas herring photo essay alaska","story":"Dwindling numbers of the fish have led indigenous people to sue the Alaskan government for failing to protect the fishery • Photographs by Pieter Ten Hoopenby Pieter Ten Hoopen and  Jo GriffinEvery spring, the herring arrive in the cold Alaskan waters of Sitka Sound to spawn. But as those waters have warmed, their numbers have fallen drastically.Tribal leaders in Sitka have long called for better protection of herring, a fish that holds cultural as well as economic significance for the people here. To demand protection of the sac roe herring fishery on which their way of life depends, they are taking the Alaskan government to court.For the subsistence harvesters of sac roe herring in the sound, this decline has been accelerated by what they see as the failure of the government to manage the herring fishery properly. Since 2002, the Sitka Tribe of Alaska (STA) has been appealing to the board of fisheries with proposals to protect the herring population.The scale of the decline was underlined in April, with the cancellation of an annual derby that usually sees hundreds of boats from the North Pacific gather in Sitka before setting sail for two to three days’ fishing. This year, not a single ship left the port and not a single herring was caught.The Sitka tribe, of more than 4,000 people, welcomed cancellation of the derby by Alaska’s department of food and game. But the move doesn’t reverse a decade of decline. While in 2009 the derby had celebrated a record fishing season, by 2018 the Sitka sac roe herring fishery was forced to close early because the herring were too scarce and too small.It was the fourth time in eight years that the herring fishery had shut down early without meeting the quota, following early closures in 2012, 2013 and 2016. In 2018 the department had expected a catch of more than 11,000 tonnes of sac roe herring, but not even 3,000 tonnes were produced, according to its own report.While the commercial industry harvests the eggs from inside the fish once caught, subsistence harvesters set out hemlock branches after the fleet leaves, where herring spawn and lay their eggs. Native Alaskans have been harvesting herring in this way for centuries but, in recent years, they have been pulling up branches bare. They say herring spawn now only cover a fraction of the coastline, and fear is mounting within the Sitka tribe that local stocks are on the verge of collapse.At the heart of the dispute with Alaska’s authorities is the question of whether the herring – which feeds on zooplankton and phytoplankton and is a key food for salmon, seabirds and marine mammals – is designated a forage fish. The STA wants the species to be included on a forage fish management plan, acknowledging its importance in the Alaskan food web.The Sitka tribe also want Alaskan authorities to decrease the size of the herring that can be taken to market in order to protect the species, but say their requests have fallen on deaf ears. Herring return to spawn for up to seven years, each year growing larger depending on conditions in the ocean. It takes a fish at least five years to reach the size and roe maturity that processors want.In 2018, the fisheries board turned down a proposal to reduce the level of the commercial catch, and last December STA launched legal action in the superior court to demand a new management plan for the fishery. The Sitka tribe also want the court to find the actions of the fisheries board department of food and game illegal.A spokesperson for the STA explained the action, saying: “The time is now to ensure that our people have the chance to fulfil their cultural responsibilities, which have been interwoven with the herring since time immemorial, and to fill their freezers. We cannot sit by while the state of Alaska shirks its statutory and constitutional duties to citizens. We demand action by the state.”The trial – the culmination of more than two decades of concern over declining herring for the Sitka tribe – has been set for January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ead48d020bfa52459345e37be2924da6dc8c77f5/0_99_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3698d1127b68047a03c9c5889be4d04a","title":"john boyega ive met americans who dont know black people live in london","story":"Entertainment is great chance to open people’s eyes, says Star Wars actorThe Star Wars actor John Boyega says he has met Americans who are not aware there are black people living in London, and believes the under-representation of the black British experience in popular culture fuels such ignorance.Boyega made the comments in a Radio Times interview where he discussed his future plans to create work about black life in Britain, partly as a result of having to explain to Americans that black Londoners exist while promoting his 2011 breakthrough film Attack the Block.He said: “I’m black British and I’m from London.

Boyega will play Leroy Logan, one of the first black Met police officers.Boyega had to go through a seven-month audition process before he secured the part of Finn in Abrams’ Star Wars trilogy. The third film, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, is out this month and earlier this year Boyega admitted to losing his script, which ended up on eBay, before being reclaimed by Disney."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a3a724566a8330cab5c7c580ac03914d8db309a/0_142_2506_1504/master/2506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82697b90fe27324ed8f31ab390cad0e5","title":"maggie smith harry potter downton abbey were not satisfying","story":"The actor has said that, while grateful for the work, ‘I didn’t really feel I was acting in those things’Dame Maggie Smith has said her work in the Harry Potter films and on Downton Abbey “wasn’t what you’d call satisfying”.The actor, 84, played schoolmistress Minerva McGonagall in the boy-wizard films and the waspish Violet Crawley in the period drama. Discussing the earlier years of her career, she told ES magazine: “It seemed to take ages to get away from light comedy.”She added: “I am deeply grateful for the work in Potter and indeed Downton, but it wasn’t what you’d call satisfying. I didn’t really feel I was acting in those things.”Smith returned to the stage this year as Joseph Goebbels’ secretary in the Christopher Hampton one-woman play A German Life. She said that as soon as she agreed to do it, she suffered “doubt, doubt, doubt”.“I suddenly felt twice as old as I actually was,” she said. “And also, when you haven’t done a show for a long time, there’s something pretty dumb about doing it totally on your own.”The long-awaited Downton Abbey movie made almost $200m on release earlier this year, with home entertainment numbers expected to be healthy. Smith was reported to be on of the last cast members to agree to the feature film her involvement would also be key to any sequel.Speaking about the possibility of a followup last week, one of the film’s producers, Graham Neame, confirmed there is a potential film in the works.“We’re working on what the story is,” he said, “and when we might be able to make it.“But it’s the same as the first time around: we have to try and get everyone back together again. And that was very challenging.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b1493393e4788b034184c7f3bbb63ff0aad71c2/0_100_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1be80a9b36973db76d24deda25ce4f28","title":"the last right review colm meaney irish comedy drama","story":"This Christmas homecoming story about a lawyer and his autistic brother is predictable but fits like a well-worn onesie’Tis the season for festive comedy-dramas about awkward andor farcical homecomings. There will be worse ways to dodge the high-street rush than this genial, Christmas-set Irish indie, in which hotshot Boston lawyer Daniel (Michiel Huisman) returns to his native Cork after his mother’s death to chaperone autistic teenage brother Louis (Samuel Bottomley).Writer-director Aoife Crehan acknowledges a certain debt to Barry Levinson’s once prizewinning, now unfashionable Rain Man early on, and proves no less upfront about her dramatic contrivances. The first act is a veritable blizzard of twaddle designed to get the brothers and mortuary assistant Mary (Niamh Algar) into a Volvo bearing a coffin containing the body of the stranger that Daniel sat next to on his flight. Weather that, and you can settle in for a middle-of-the-road road movie across a drizzly, provincial Ireland: gently heartwarming, mildly amusing, only vaguely related to real life. Inevitably, family secrets are unearthed and worked through en route inevitably, the two grown-ups have a moment, then a tiff, before pushing on towards reconciliation.Crehan knits it together like a well-worn onesie: you know exactly what shape it’s going to be once you’re wrapped up in it, but that doesn’t mean it lacks for comfort and warmth. Odd surprises keep it from terminal predictability: there are a couple of pretty good gags related to Louis’s soup habit, and a thoroughly unexpected revival of the comedian Denis Leary’s 1996 single Asshole, which appears to have stuck around in Crehan’s head longer than it did in the charts.The performers, meanwhile, roll up the sleeves of their winter wear and strive to lend inherently thin material what heft they can. Huisman putters along in a blandly personable second gear, but Bottomley is sparkier, and there’s another useful profile boost for Algar, so compelling in Shane Meadows’ The Virtues on TV. • The Last Right is released in the UK on 6 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b23a6ef0ee9dafc8aadb8c25d77028769401f861/315_0_1412_847/master/1412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=749c4850c71cc02e5e5fbafd992acbc4","title":"why alternate reality movies are making comeback la belle epoque jumanji","story":"A new wave of ‘rubber reality’ cinema, from La Belle Époque to the latest Jumanji sequel, is coinciding with social anxiety, political populism and a loss of faith in factsIn the film La Belle Époque, which is now showing in UK cinemas, a French comic book artist called Victor (Daniel Auteuil) seeks refuge from a foundering marriage and faltering career in a meticulous facsimile of 1974. He finds himself in the bar where he first met his wife, when the world was at his feet, and where customers and staff are all still puffing away on Gauloises. It’s like a peculiarly French mashup of Westworld and The Truman Show.Unlike Truman, though, Victor is aware that his surroundings have been artificially created, and they help him come to terms with his present. Travelling into the past is a conscious decision on his part, one that has been specifically ordered and paid for, albeit from “Les Voyageurs du Temps”, an outfit that sounds like something from a story by Philip K Dick – Rekal Incorporated, perhaps, from We Can Remember It for You Wholesale (the inspiration for Total Recall and its 2012 remake) – or from one of Charlie Kaufman’s screenplays, such as Lacuna Inc. from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Indeed, the plot of La Belle Epoque is so improbable it could almost be sci-fi, but the film has muscled its way to mainstream attention by refashioning its premise as a romantic comedy of manners.In the forthcoming fantasy-adventure comedy sequel Jumanji: The Next Level, three high-school students go back into the role-playing game to rescue a friend. This time, unlike in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017), they make a conscious decision to immerse themselves in an artificial world, where you can be sure a fresh set of life lessons will be learned. And in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, due in UK cinemas next month, TV personality Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks) dispenses benign aperçus and life lessons from the studio where he presides over a pastel-coloured toy village complete with model railway, “Owl Correspondence School” and puppet population. No one is under the illusion that the village is real, yet it’s not an escapist theme park so much as a safe place of emotional honesty and positive thinking.These characters use their simulated realities in a therapeutic way, just as Mark Hogancamp (Steve Carell) in Welcome to Marwen (2018) deals with the brain damage he sustained in an attack by white supremacists by building a village in his backyard. Not just any village but a Belgian one in the second world war. No longer able to paint or draw because of his injuries, Hogancamp works through his unresolved trauma by setting up and photographing melodramatic scenarios in which the village’s Action Man and Barbie doll inhabitants, as avatars of himself and the people he knows, repeatedly fight back against the Nazi invaders.Such scenarios stand out amid one of the most pervasive cinema trends of the past 30 years, in that they’ve added a layer of awareness to the “rubber reality” syndrome. From The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) onwards, the cinema has always dabbled in alternative realities and imaginary worlds, but towards the end of the 20th century this tendency went into overdrive. In film after film, characters discover that their world is not what it seems. That it is, in fact, a fictional construct sparked by psychological or pathological conditions (Jacob’s Ladder Fight Club A Beautiful Life), or created by aliens (Dark City), an artificial intelligence (The Matrix), psychiatrists (Shutter Island), the supernatural (The Sixth Sense The Others), self-delusion (Mulholland Drive) or friends and relatives (Good Bye, Lenin! 50 First Dates).Rubber reality also crept into crime movies such as The Usual Suspects, Wild Things and at least two thrillers with the tip-off title Deception (2000 and 2008). Such films are fanciful, more personalised updates of the political paranoia thrillers of the 1970s. In preposterous thrillers such as Malice (1993), 88 Minutes (2007), Trance (2013) and Side Effects (2013), the criminal masterplan is so elaborate and requires such insane levels of plotting that you almost feel sorry for the villains, who really ought to have channelled all that preparation and ingenuity into a more lucrative, less risky undertaking, such as politics.Classic film noir, in which the antihero is entangled in a web of deception, often spun by femmes fatales in cahoots with the bad guys, was a shadowy precursor to the reality-is-not-as-it-seems scenario. And just as that genre in its 1940s heyday reflected the anxiety and alienation of a society still traumatised by the second world war and undermined by shifts in moral certitude, so the rise of rubber reality cinema coincided with the evolution of the conspiracy theory from a minority pursuit into a mainstream interest fed by the internet, The X-Files, 911, falsified WMD reports, the Panama Papers and Wikileaks.With so many films pedalling the scenario that the narrative is not to be trusted, audiences have become almost addicted to the “twist”, expecting or demanding one even where it doesn’t exist. Thus they’ve also been primed for a situation in which reality can no longer be trusted, facts are indistinguishable from fiction, everyone has a hidden agenda, the moon landing was faked, vaccination causes autism, the Earth is flat, and Britain can return to a great and glorious past in which the rest of the world falls over itself to shower it with amazing trade deals.With or without a narrative twist, films already offer alternate realities in which audiences can seek refuge, whether it’s an idealised vision of class-ridden Britain in the Downton Abbey movie, the extended Lucasverse of the Star Wars franchise and its TV spin-offs, or the Marvel films, where might is always right and the good guys come out on top. In this context, it’s heartening to see a few pioneers such as La Belle Époque and A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood, which suggest to audiences that they themselves can control the narrative, rather than be controlled by it, and that - rather than requiring an army of servants, a full set of Infinity Stones or the Force, all it will take is emotional honesty and clear-eyed thinking.• Jumanji: The Next Level is released in UK cinemas on 13 December. A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood is released on 31 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02ff8cff349d9a0285a0c36071aa032609fdb199/0_0_8829_5299/master/8829.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f56afd6bca3006c4fd6f5498c30e3f1a","title":"felicity cloakes mince pie masterclass an easy step by step recipe","story":"How to make proper mince pies, with crumbly, rich pastry and fruity filling.

The whisky can be replaced by fruit juice or tea, though it won’t keep as well if you go down the booze-free route.You can make the mincemeat well in advance, so long as you sterilise the jars properly (if you’re using it immediately, skip this step). Either wash the jars and lids in hot, soapy water, or run them through a hot dishwasher cycle, then dry them in a low oven (about 120C (100C fan)250Fgas ¼) for 20 minutes, until dry, and fill them straight from the oven.Roughly chop any of the fruit that needs it into raisin-sized pieces. Lightly toast the nuts, if using, in a dry pan until fragrant, then roughly chop them, too. Put both into a large bowl with the ginger, sugar, spice, whisky (brandy, golden or dark rum, amaretto or sloe gin will also work), zest, grated apple and suet, or grate in the butter, if using.Add a little more spice, if you think it needs it, or indeed booze. If you haven’t used the ginger, add a dash more booze, to make up for the loss of the syrup. Decant into the sterilised jars if you’re not planning on using the filling immediately.Sift the flour into a bowl with a good pinch of fine salt. If you’d prefer to keep it nut-free, swap the ground almonds for the same amount of extra flour. Grate in the cold butter, then rub this into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture looks like damp sand.Stir in the ground almonds (or extra flour) and sugar. Whisk the egg yolks with the orange blossom water, if using, and a tablespoon and a half of ice-cold water (two, if you’re not using the orange blossom water) – add just enough to bring the mix together into a firm, but not wet dough. Shape into a ball by hand, wrap well, and chill for half an hour.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 5. Grease two tartlet tins of whatever size you prefer with butter, and roll out half the pastry on a lightly floured surface until about 3mm thick. Cut out bases a little larger than the tin holes and use to line them, then fill each about three-quarters full with the mincemeat.Roll out the other half of the pastry and cut out into rounds the same size as the tin holes. Alternatively, cut out stars or hearts, or top the pies with nuts (whole pecans and flaked almonds are nice) or even marzipan shapes, if you prefer less pastry-heavy pies.If using a pastry top, dampen the edge of the lids with a little water or milk, and press down lightly on the pies to seal. Brush the tops with milk or beaten egg, and prick with a fork. Bake for about 20 minutes, until golden, then cool on a rack and dust with icing sugar before serving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/790e4100b61f9a2ff0aa8a257418d7c4a350aa13/763_257_5143_3087/master/5143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06a87fc6f6f166a9a3eef58ead633716","title":"crisps cheese and curacao how to have a fantastic election night party","story":"It may be a bit early to bring this up, but on the other hand, it is only a week away: what are you going to eat on election night? On 1 May 1997, a journalist named Gavin Hills held an election party that became the stuff of fable.There was a firework for every Tory, let off when they lost their seat, and the sky was ablaze. I wasn’t there, as I didn’t know him, but people talked about it so fervently afterwards that it has entered my memory as the best election night I ever had – the one I wasn’t at. Hills died in a freak drowning accident the same month, tragically young at 31, and the magic of the election party died with him. Now, instead, we have snacks.In the 00s elections, it tended to be pretty clear who was going to win, because Labour was going to win. I remember doing a Question Time-style panel for some sixth formers in 2010, and some bright spark asked Gus O’Donnell whether the civil service was ready for a hung parliament. “Never mind a coalition, we’re not ready for a change of government,” he said.Even though elections are inherently exciting because you get to stay up late, there was very little to get excited about, few marginals and even fewer surprises.You can have a lot of fun with colour coding when the stakes aren’t very high. I used to make cheesecakes decorated as a bar chart of the vote share, which was a shame as people actually prefer blueberries to strawberries, and kiwi to lemon. You can do the same with tiny quiches (cheese, chorizo, spinach), so long as you pretend to think aubergines are blue, when they are actually purple, and you ignore Ukip for disambiguation, which we all did, anyway, probably for too long.That was quite a lot of work in 2001 2005 was entirely crisps. Cheese and onion for the Tories, salt and vinegar for the Greens, roast chicken for the Lib Dems and spicy tomato Wheat Crunchies for Labour, which are – when in the right mood – the most delicious crisp imaginable.In 2010, the accepted wisdom was that Labour would probably scrape through again. There was just a residual sense that the country would give Gordon Brown one term of his own, because of fairness, and how long he had been waiting. Subconsciously, I must have known that wasn’t true, because my hosting strategy was to get everyone completely hammered. It had taken a decade, but having finally acknowledged that there were no blue foods apart from fruit, and that nobody wants fruit at a party, I went nuts with blue curaçao (plus vodka and lemonade to make a blue lagoon), very red negronis, greyhounds (which are yellowish) and caipirinhas. When the results started to roll in, nobody could understand them – it was like watching dogs try to do crosswords.There is a salient point to make here about how often accepted wisdom is wrong not because polling is flawed or the country has changed in invisible ways, but because of the baseline assumption that things will probably be a bit like they were last time.So, in 2015, everyone was expecting another hung parliament, and the mood turned to ash at exactly 10pm with the exit polls. I can’t remember whether or not people immediately went home, but they definitely didn’t eat the colour-coded macarons, which was good, as they are mad expensive and I hadn’t bought enough.I didn’t have a party for the EU referendum, because it was a stain on democracy. Nor in 2017, because, again, even though I didn’t believe the prevailing certainty of a Tory landslide, I didn’t think I had the stomach to toast it if it happened.This year is different, because I’ve had an epiphany it would have been helpful to have in 2010: whatever the result, the day after will demand more energy and fellowship, not less.So this year, I’m focusing on people rather than parties – which, in any case, are more fun to represent. I’ll take a bunch of marginals and make a finger food out of regionally appropriate snacks. A lot of them will be by the sea (North East Fife, Hastings and Rye, Workington), so fish finger sandwiches. All anyone eats in Richmond and Cheltenham is vol-au-vents. Brecon and Radnorshire is, of course, in Wales, which cracks open the world of the welsh rarebit. Anywhere not by the sea probably has its own cheese.I’m not promising to enjoy it: I might just sit in and eat all this stuff on my own. But I do plan to unite the kingdom in buffet form, and if that means getting in the Staffordshire oatcakes (Newcastle-under-Lyme), that’s fine by me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c82466ad93a779c05e0b9cafe6c17cda14b58d0/40_62_2482_1489/master/2482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcd5293972f91a0821557b42e0ec894c","title":"marco silva on brink after derby thrashing as everton line up david moyes return","story":"Marco Silva is on the brink of the sack as Everton manager following a comprehensive derby defeat by Liverpool, with David Moyes lined up for a return to Goodison Park.Everton conceded five goals against their local rivals for the first time since 1982 as they slipped into the relegation zone with an eighth defeat in 11 league games. Divock Origi and Sadio Mané punished a shambolic defensive display by the visitors as Liverpool set a new club record of 32 league games unbeaten and recorded their 100th Premier League victory under Jürgen Klopp. It could prove to be Silva’s final game as Everton manager, with Moyes favourite to replace the beleaguered Portuguese coach and Tim Cahill being considered as his assistant.Silva admitted Everton were “not good enough” and conceded a series of dreadful goals from a defensive perspective. “We have to do better, be more brave and win more challenges,” he added. “We knew they would make runs in behind but we were not strong enough. It was not good enough, what we did tonight.”Klopp, by contrast, could savour another derby victory after making five changes to the team that started against Brighton on Saturday. The Liverpool manager said: “It was really good, especially in the circumstances I created pretty much myself with the line-up. We had to make changes. It was clear we needed fresh legs and what the boys did in this difficult game was exceptional.”Klopp’s century of league wins as Liverpool manager arrived in 159 games, quicker than any of his predecessors. “It is not a number I’m interested in,” he claimed. “It’s 300 points, that’s cool, but only 43 points helps us this season. The boys are the reason for the wins. It’s just a number, it’s cool but it’s necessary too.

Absolutely no one. Not a single soul”, before the words “Corriere dello Sport headline writer” and a picture of the front page.Inter did not reference the newspaper article, but tweeted: “Football is passion, culture and brotherhood. We are and will always be against all forms of discrimination.”The organisation Fare network, which works against discrimination and for social inclusion in football, also tweeted, saying: “The media fuels racism every day. This is today’s edition of Italian sport daily Corriere dello Sport.”In the article the newspaper appeared to attempt to highlight the league’s racism problem. “In the faces of those idiots who boo, tomorrow everyone must instead go ‘oooh’ like children. It will be a Black Friday, but this is not an end-of-season sale,” the article said. It went on to describe Lukaku and Smalling as “two giants of colour”.Lukaku and Smalling have both made successful starts to their careers in Italy. Lukaku has 10 goals in 14 Serie A games with Inter top of the league, one point before Juventus. Smalling has been an ever-present since making his debut against Atalanta towards the end of September, having scored two goals and provided one assist.Serie A has again been plagued by racist incidents this season, with Lukaku himself and the Brescia forward Mario Balotelli among those to be racially abused by supporters during games. An Italian TV pundit was also sacked for saying the only way to stop Lukaku was to give “him 10 bananas to eat”.Only last week all 20 clubs in Italy’s top tier signed an open letter which called on “all those who love Italian football” to unite to try to eradicate its “serious problem with racism”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35e43a49202f882fcf18f7313f95feb79fe5e478/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f44f77ce44a90a7a71091872a2a33562","title":"the 100 best female footballers in the world 2019","story":"Alex Morgan and Ellen White are among the players ranked between 40 and 11 as our countdown continues.

It’s doubtful you, or anyone you know, has any strong feelings about them. Primary school teacher and part-time street artist Andy McVeigh, on the other hand, certainly does. He’s been daubing dull electric boxes around Leeds since last year, replacing the lifeless green with vibrant Leeds United-themed murals depicting classic shirts, lyrics of chants and stencils of players past and present.Popular with fans and residents alike, McVeigh creates his designs independently – he isn’t paid for his time or imagination – simply seeking to improve the aesthetics of his local neighbourhoods and honour his home club. “There’s virtually no Leeds United art anywhere in the city, which seems daft to me,” says Andy. “Even in the City Museum there’s a pretty pathetic token gesture to the club when it’s one of the most famous things about the place.”The murals leading to the ground have become part of the matchday experience for many, with fans tapping the boxes for luck before games. Younger fans are also enamoured with his colourful compositions. “Kids love it, which is brilliant because I’m a primary teacher and had that in mind when I did them. One bloke told me his kids asked him to do a tour of them with him.”McVeigh offered to sit down with them in an effort to build bridges, but the group said: “We have no interest in ‘having a coffee’ with this person. He simply needs to desist in his vandalism.” McVeigh was devastated. “Obviously I was gutted. Each one probably takes two or three evenings to do. At my own cost. It was bewildering why someone destroyed them. A very ‘troubled’ person, I guess. The person responsible sent very sinister emails, which were actually quite disturbing.”Local fans were aghast at the senseless destruction of Andy’s quirky artwork. “The vandalism was nothing but targeted bullying,” says season ticket holder Jack Sanderson, who believes the murals have become a symbol for the positivity returning to Elland Road in recent years. “The art itself is absolutely brilliant and an asset to the matchday experience. Projects like Andy’s have been a light in a very dark place and Andy himself is absolutely golden too. He genuinely just wants to make people happy through his talent.”The club and community rallied around McVeigh, fundraising to replenish his paint supplies and allow him a few days off to repair his artwork. Leeds United offered him and his son complimentary tickets for his efforts and, together with Leeds City Council and Virgin Media, they commissioned McVeigh to officially decorate the electric boxes surrounding Elland Road.He has since returned to his work, bolstered by the positive reaction of fans and neighbours alike. “Every time I’m out painting now, I get loads of people beeping horns, shouting encouragement, giving me the Leeds salute. Tons of people stop for a chat. The reaction was genuinely overwhelming. Sounds cheesy but it’s true. It’s like the whole city came together.

M\u0026ampG admitted it had been unable to sell commercial property fast enough to fund the rush for the door by investors, leaving it with no choice but to block further withdrawals.The fund’s biggest holdings include shopping centres such as Fremlin Walk in Maidstone, Kent, where House of Fraser is one of the biggest tenants, the Gracechurch centre in Sutton Coldfield, where stores include House of Fraser, Topshop and New Look and the Wales designer Outlet in Bridgend, home to retailers including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Next.Investors may now have to wait months to see their cash again. In the aftermath of the Brexit referendum in 2016, M\u0026ampG’s fund was shut from July to November, as panicked investors fearing a collapse in values were prevented from withdrawing their cash.There will now be concern of a domino effect in a repeat of the 2016 experience, when funds worth a total of £35bn were forced to close their doors.M\u0026ampG said the suspension would give it time to sell property to raise cash to repay investors. While the fund is suspended, M\u0026ampG will cut the fees it charges to manage the fund. M\u0026ampG did not give a timeline for when the fund would be reopened, saying it was monitoring the situation daily.The fund is the latest victim of Britain’s ailing high streets and shopping centres. Last month, the independent valuers Knight Frank knocked £76m off the value of the fund’s retail assets, after what Knight Frank described as a marked deterioration in the retail sector since the summer. It warned of falling rents even in highly sought after locations.The suspension of the fund is highly embarrassing for the M\u0026ampG group, one of the world’s largest property investors with £33.5bn invested on behalf of small investors and pension funds alike.Its property investments are largely focused on retail parks, which have been hit particularly hard by the problems facing bricks and mortar retailers, which include cost increases driven by the higher minimum wage and business rates bills and the switch by shoppers to buying more goods online.Many retailers, including New Look, Monsoon and Debenhams have used a legal insolvency procedure to force rent cuts – which hit the value of property – while House of Fraser, which is owned by Sports Direct, has agreed many low or no rent deals with its landlords as the department store chain struggles to stay afloat.Gina Miller, the anti-Brexit campaigner who also manages an investment firm, SCM Direct, said M\u0026ampG’s decision to partly blame Brexit was a distraction as there had been related uncertainty since the 2016 EU referendum.The suspension of the fund is likely to raise further alarm among investors as it comes so soon after the debacle at Woodford funds, which was also unable to finance withdrawals from investors.Ryan Hughes of AJ Bell, an investment platform, said: “M\u0026ampG’s decision to suspend the fund comes at a time when there is heightened concern about liquidity in funds, with investors understandably jittery after Woodford’s fund closure. ”“This news will unnerve them, because it may spark some additional selling from large holders,” said Jason Hollands, a fund adviser at Tilney Investment Management Services.It said: “We will continue to monitor the situation closely and in particular any impact M\u0026ampG’s decision has on investor sentiment towards the sector.”“To avoid the brickbats this time, ‘the smart money’ has been selling ahead of the general election, as a Corbyn-led government will likely trigger a sell-off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7898b89a1a814687c3f8f0d3b38bbb5356872ee/0_0_5062_3038/master/5062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b16d40b7ec050e1a9b289ef095880738","title":"dont mention the president boris survives nato summit largely unscathed","story":"US president ditches 70 years of Nato diplomacy and opts for some good old-fashioned name-calling It’s war. The summit that was meant to celebrate Nato’s 70th anniversary as one of the greatest peacetime alliances in history ended in open hostility. Had it gone on for another day, nukes might have been fired. Donald Trump stomped off from the golf resort just outside Watford in a huff, cancelling his scheduled press conference. For the first time in living memory, the US president was lost for words – even the usual ones that mixed lies with unintelligibility.There again, the writing had rather been on the wall long before the summit had even started. Having previously slagged off Nato at every opportunity, Trump had now become outraged that other countries were taking the US for granted and not paying their fair share. Emmanuel Macron had declared the organisation brain dead. President Erdoğan had started buying arms off the Russians.Boris Johnson just wanted to avoid being seen in the same room as the US president during an election campaign. British voters might be happy to turn a blind eye to the prime minister’s liaisons with Jennifer Arcuri and others, but they took a dim view of his shameless brown-nosing to the Orange Sun Bed God.Still, they all might have got away with it had the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, not been caught on camera sharing a joke about Trump’s chaotic press conference, with Johnson, Macron and Princess Anne at a Buckingham Palace reception.That stung Trump. The president might have few social skills – when he and Boris get together it’s a meeting of true narcissistic mindlessness – but even he can tell when he’s getting badly mugged off. So he had made a point of being the last to arrive for the Wednesday golf course meeting and keeping Boris waiting out in the cold. It was the least he could do to try to retrieve what passed for his self worth.At his own press conference, Johnson had tried to play the complete innocent. He couldn’t imagine how anyone might have imagined he had been laughing at President Trump. So it was left to Trudeau to tidy things up. It turned out that for once Trump had been fairly accurate in his assessment, as the Canadian went full two-faced. Sure they had all been having a laugh. But with the president not at him. He loved the orange panda to bits. The guy was the life and soul and all the other world leaders really looked up to him. His tie! His intelligence! His insight! Hell, the Donald had it all. And he just couldn’t wait till the next G7 at Camp David.On the way back home, Johnson breathed a sigh of relief. The summit had been a disaster, but his kind of disaster. He hadn’t even dared hope the president would cancel his presser. So much possible shit averted. Everyone would talk of the Trump-Trudeau spat and no one would mention the NHS. The west might be one step nearer to being at war with itself. But Boris was one step nearer winning the election.John Crace’s new book, Decline and Fail: Read in Case of Political Apocalypse, is published by  Faber.

The graffiti has long been scrubbed off. The question posed, however, remains as pertinent as ever.“It was devastating,” said 59-year-old Mark Kaczmarek, a former miner who was a shop steward when South Crofty shut. “Politicians came around, having their photographs taken with the miners, promising this, that and the other. Then you never heard nor saw them again”.So he stood as an independent local councillor and has been campaigning for its reopening. It makes sense, he argues: the price of tin has risen. There is plenty in the mine. A Canadian company is exploring possibilities. He is hopeful that within five years, it could be operational again.“There could be 200 well-paid jobs,” he said. “So if any politician puts on their leaflet they are supporting South Crofty opening again, it would get my vote, and others’.”But the constituency fans out over agricultural land, coastal communities and wealthy estuarial villages such as Port Navas, with its regatta, yacht club and famed wild oysters.It has been held by the Conservative George Eustice, from a local farming family, since 2010, when boundary changes chopped out Falmouth and its docks and inserted Hayle, with its St Ives Bay holiday parks and Three Mile Beach.A dearth of well-paid, secure jobs is high on the list of local concerns, along with insufficient affordable housing. Jobs in the bygone mines and big engineering companies have largely been replaced with those in small industry, retail or seasonal tourism work, with many part-time or zero-hours contracts. The largest employers are Cornwall council and the NHS. The area has higher than average self-employment.About 100 miles from the nearest motorway, it suffers from low wages but a high cost of living, constituents answering a  callout said. Wealthier outsiders and second home owners push up house prices and push out young families. Stripped services have meant “every trip out is a bit like a Ken Loach film” with scenic backdrop, according to one woman. Boris Johnson recently promised a new women-and-children’s unit at the hospital in Treliske, Truro. But the facility is overloaded by tourists in the summer and overwhelmed by the elderly in winter.Gardner, 75, joined the engineering company Holman Brothers from school as an electrical engineer. At one time it employed 3,200 making air compressors and rock drills, but closed in 2003.“That was the backbone of Camborne,’ said Gardner. “Now the manufacturing jobs are gone, there’s no good full-time jobs. People can’t buy homes because they can’t get a mortgage because they have not got permanent work.”He knows better than most of the post-industrial problems prevalent here. On being made redundant, he set up an electrical engineering business, but since retirement 10 years ago has run the Transformation CPR foodbank in Camborne and Redruth. One of the largest in the UK, it delivers 16,000 meals a month – up from 12,000 this time last year.Based at the Centenary Wesleyan church in Camborne and staffed by 74 volunteers, it is part of the End Hunger Cornwall network, whose slogan is: “You can’t eat the view.” Last Christmas he had to offer pastoral care to volunteer drivers “coming back in tears at what they saw” when delivering ready-to-cook Christmas lunches to families in need.“Camborne is three miles from the coast, but there are children here who have never seen the sea,” he said. Scaremongering over Brexit, and the uncertainty of delay, will be major factors for voters, he believes. “People that come in here are struggling. For many it is ‘heat or eat’. They have had enough. Brexit is the big story, and they just want it done.”He is weighing up options and would “love to vote Labour”, but has concerns about Labour’s costing of its manifesto and, as someone who voted to leave the EU, about Jeremy Corbyn’s neutrality on Brexit.Corbyn’s stance caused some confusion on the doorstep until it was explained, one Labour canvasser admitted. But not for 49-year-old Russ Johnston, who, with the climate crisis very much on his agenda, is a committed Green party voter.Johnston, who has a doctorate in evolutionary biology and palaeontology, moved to the village of Constantine 10 years ago with his American wife, Caitlin DeSilvey, 47, an associate professor of cultural geography at Exeter University based at the nearby Penryn campus shared with Falmouth University. The campus has about 1,800 students, which could prove significant on 12 December.Constantine, where Zoopla records the average house price as above £300,000, is three miles from Cornwall’s south coast. It has a Spar shop, the Constantine Stores off-licence (which also sells online) and a mobile post-office once a week, and is imbued with vibrant community spirit.The couple, who have sons aged 12 and three, tend an organic allotment on the village edge and are active with Transition Constantine, part of a global movement towards community sustainability. Transition volunteers have helped transform an old chapel into a community centre, fitted solar panels on the local school, manage nearby woodland for community use and run a local newsletter, The Constant Times.A stay-at-home father and independent researcher, Johnston has served twice on the village pre-school committee. Ten years ago, 10 of the 12-strong committee had attended the school or grown up in the village. Today only “one or two” have that connection. The others are from outside, he said.“There is a missing generation of people who would have had their kids at that school and would have gone to it themselves,” Johnston said. The elderly do not have children and grandchildren nearby, heralding a future social care crisis.“Housing is a huge issue and young people just can’t afford to stay here,” said DeSilvey. Professionally, she also worries about the Brexit effect on EU academic research funding.Johnston, who voted to remain in the EU, admires Corbyn’s Brexit strategy. “If elected, being in a position to field a second vote without taking sides is probably as fair and smart a position to be in as you can manage to get,” he says. He also believes Labour’s Green Industrial Revolution proposals allow him to “align my green priorities with that vote”. In a “two-horse” constituency, he will vote tactically for Labour.Labour is chasing the engaged green vote here, and it has left some conflicted. At a hustings organised by the St Day Climate Action Group, 18-year-old Elle Pyner, an arts foundation student and first-time voter, broke down as she told a packed village hall she wanted to vote Green but felt pressured to vote Labour to ensure the Conservatives lost.“It makes me feel as though what I am doing is wrong,” she said, in tears. After being consoled by others, she will now look for a vote swap in Bristol. “They can vote Green for me, and I will vote Labour for them,” she said. “So my Green vote will count where it will matter.”Should South Crofty ever reopen, Kaczmarek, who voted for remain and worries who will plug the EU funding gap, knows 200 jobs will not solve problems. But he believes mining – including for lithium, for which testing is currently ongoing – will return in some form. “And it would be a huge boost.” He had not yet decided his vote. “I want someone who will stick their head above the parapet, and fight for Cornwall.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eda4ea0e8e1f3222128c1dc6a712ac086b0fd45c/6_0_1910_1146/master/1910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a95883e399fbfbcd96ec13aaae1520a","title":"election polls uk 2019 latest opinion poll tracker","story":"Find out who’s ahead using our opinion poll tracker.

Breitbart, the Washington Times, Fox News and the rest of the usual suspects quickly reported the contents of this provocative tweet: “Spent the morning at the Indigenous People’s Sunrise Ceremony on the 50 year anniversary of the Occupation of Alcatraz. The US government has stolen over 1.5 billion acres of land from Indigenous people. Thank you to my Indigenous family, I’m with you today and always.”Just in case that benign announcement didn’t raise the Defcon 1: Apocalypse Looming alarm in your head, Fox started the “news” story by editorializing the contents: “Former NFL player Colin Kaepernick had an odd way of celebrating Thanksgiving, attending an event that appeared to serve as a rebuke to the holiday and the United States.” News reports aren’t supposed to tell us it’s an “odd way” unless they already want to bias the reader. Say it ain’t so, Fox! The conservative political site the Blaze’s headline also wanted to make sure the readers don’t have to burden themselves with thinking: “Colin Kaepernick bashes America on Thanksgiving, participates in ‘Unthanksgiving Day’ celebration.” Technically, pointing out a fact isn’t “bashing.” America’s forefathers did indeed steal the land from the indigenous people, often over their dead bodies. Just as indigenous people stole land from other tribes. That’s just historical fact. Like pointing out to grandpa that his zipper is open. I’m not bashing him, just stating a truth. So, why the panicky attacks on Kaepernick? Clearly, there’s something much more insidious going on here: the sustained attempt to steal Kaepernick’s political voice by characterizing him as un-American. The Black Grinch who wants to steal White Christmas American values.This attempt to drown out Kaepernick’s voice by shouting unfounded personal insults has been going on since he first took a knee during the national anthem in 2016. But really it’s how conservative America has always treated African American athletes who speak out, whether it’s Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, Tommie Smith, John Carlos, or any of the others. It’s the equivalent of sticking fingers in their ears while shouting, “Nyah, nyah, nyah, I can’t hear you.”Kaepernick’s highly publicized tryout last month did not seem designed to seriously consider him for readmittance into the NFL. Instead, it looked like a media-savvy sham-show to make the NFL look like the good guys while destroying Kaepernick’s credibility as an athlete and therefore as a spokesman for anything, be it social justice or Nike. When the NFL refused to allow the media to attend and insisted on sole control over the video of the tryout, Kaepernick balked and moved the location so that the media could attend and no one could control how the world witnessed his football skills. The NFL also wanted him to sign a contract apparently agreeing not to sue the league if he wasn’t signed. There was no point to this unusual set-up except to promote a progressive image for the NFL: “See, we’re no longer trying to silence an outspoken athlete. We’ve evolved. We’re woke, baby!” Not really.Neither the focus on his tweet nor the NFL pretense of his tryout are really about Colin Kaepernick, the man or the player. They are about all the other athletes who conservatives are trying to preemptively silence. NBA superstars like LeBron James and Steph Curry are impervious to this kind of treatment, in part because the NBA didn’t campaign to blackball them. Fox News, Breitbart, and the other mouthpieces of entitlement and walling-off-the-truth can’t touch them. But other players, especially young ones working their way up through the ranks, may be stifled by the example of Kaepernick left to twist in the wind of no-change.Fifty years ago, 14 black football players from the University of Wyoming were kicked off the team because they asked their coach if they could wear a black armband in solidarity with the campus group, the Black Student Alliance. The armbands were to protest Brigham Young University, which Wyoming was scheduled to play, because of the Mormon Church’s refusal to allow black parishioners to become clergy, which every white member was entitled to. (This rule was abolished in 1978.) The team recalled that the previous year, when playing at BYU, their opponents spat at them, used racial slurs, and took cheap shots at their knees on the field. The Wyoming coach had ignored his players’ complaints. So, when they walked into the coach’s office to explain what they wanted to do, the coach interrupted them with, “As of this moment, you are no longer members of the Wyoming football team.” The players said he followed it with a racist rant that included telling them to return to their fatherless inner-city homes and live off welfare. The only thing the coach admitted to saying to these athletes was “Shut up!”For much longer than 50 years people have been ordering truth-tellers to shut up and punishing them when they refuse. I’m sure their tactics have silenced some athletes. Not all. They can never silence all because the kind of grit it takes to become an athlete is the same kind it takes to place truth above self-interest. But they sure will keep on trying as long as they get paid to pander to those who wrap themselves in the pretty colors of the flag rather than the bold words of the Constitution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26dfbd0ac3f041383b5a0be2561a1575a3d9bc22/273_181_2958_1775/master/2958.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86cd49e64656fac1f678871a65825e11","title":"graham thorpe england new zealand south africa squad","story":"• Batting coach sets sights on South Africa series• Anderson, Wood and Bairstow expected to be named in squadThe final word on England’s series defeat in New Zealand came from Graham Thorpe. The assistant coach was standing in for the absent Chris Silverwood at the end and urged iniduals to reflect honestly on their recent shortcomings.There is a quick turnaround before the tour of South Africa, with Ed Smith’s selection panel convening via conference call on Saturday to pick a touring party that departs on 15 December and plays a four-match series, this time counting for World Test Championship points, that begins on Boxing Day in Centurion.Jimmy Anderson, Mark Wood and Jonny Bairstow are part of an advanced group already training in Potchefstroom and are expected to be included in a squad of 16 or 17 players, while the captain, Joe Root, is due to speak to Moeen Ali after landing back in the UK to establish the all-rounder’s readiness to return.And for those players who went down 1-0 in New Zealand, Thorpe is keen for the lessons to be learned even if, like Root and a good number in the management setup, this continues to be spoken about in terms of an Ashes series still two years away.“We’ve got to keep developing our players, no doubt about that. They have to ask themselves when they come away from a trip like this: where can I get better?” said Thorpe, who deputised for Silverwood for the last three days in Hamilton with the new head coach back home following a family bereavement.“Because the big picture is that down the line in a couple of years’ time we’ll need resilient cricketers going to Australia. It’s down to our players to be honest and for us to be honest with them. If we are going to keep trying to go up that Test ladder and really compete abroad then we have to keep challenging the players along the way.”Thorpe expects Root’s bowling attack to get more zip out of the South African pitches than the ones in New Zealand that left them so neutered but even so, they must still find a way to conjure up wickets with the Kookaburra ball.As well as talking about hatching more plans for new batsmen and those well set, it was here that Thorpe questioned whether the side’s management of the ball’s condition may need improving – legally, of course, given South African camera crews are pretty eagle-eyed – in order to get more sustained movement through the air.Thorpe bemoaned a failure to seize moments in the field too. In Mount Maunganui the hosts sat on 197 for five, only to post 615 for nine through BJ Watling’s double-century, while Hamilton witnessed 191 for five become 375 all out as New Zealand’s hugely determined wicketkeeper held firm once more.He added: “The mark of a top side is one that recognises when it’s on top and is able to push it through. That’s our big learning experience from this series, for me.”As the coach responsible for the batsmen, Thorpe naturally offered support for Dom Sibley after a tricky first outing of 38 runs in three innings, insisting it was “still early days”, and was encouraged by Ollie Pope’s 75 in Hamilton that showed the “technique and temperament” England are looking for from their Test batsmen.While Rory Burns took another step up in his own development with a second Test century, Root’s double, the third of his career, was clearly the standout performance with the bat. Thorpe cited its impact on the captain’s own authority and the knock-on effect for a side striving to regularly put big first innings totals on the board.He added: “It’s great to see Root back and scoring some runs and how he is in the dressing room as well – that’s great for his confidence. But he was already held in very high esteem, so he’s just confirmed that and also that he’s a world-class player.“We’ve talked a certain way about batting a long time and I think we mustn’t misinterpret that. For me it’s just getting a big first-innings score – a 500-run target. That’s a good way of selling it to the players. And if Joe can produce more performances like that, we’ve got more chances of getting that sort of total.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cc34b3aeee2f31f01faaeb0c160afec7be7fb7b/49_0_3675_2205/master/3675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811ce9717cbbbb8bb0a352beb6a18dfb","title":"premiership rugby giants relegation salary cap saracens leicester wasps bath","story":"When Bristol took on London Irish at Ashton Gate on Sunday, it was the first time the two clubs had met in the Premiership for 10 years. One or other had been in the Championship in that time, mainly the Bears, and the presence of the two most recently promoted clubs in the top half of the Premiership is an indication of how the salary cap is working.The top four clubs have all had stints in the Championship in the past 12 years while the bottom four have always been in the Premiership: Saracens are bottom because they lost 35 points for breaching the league’s salary cap regulations, but Leicester, Wasps and Bath, former European Cup winners all, have mustered four victories in 15 matches in the tournament this season, although between them they supplied 12 players for England’s World Cup campaign.Leicester had them all back at Northampton last weekend and it did not seem to make a jot of difference as they suffered a fourth Premiership defeat, none of which yielded a bonus point. The result took the Saints to the top of the table where they stayed after Bristol drew with opponents who played the second half with 14 men.London Irish and Worcester were expected to contest the drop this season, but after five rounds both are in the top half of the table. The deal with CVC has given clubs whose average attendances are considerably lower than the likes of Leicester the means to spend up to the salary cap and Irish were unrecognisable from their last Premiership campaign two years ago when they lost 14 matches in a row on their way to an immediate return to the second tier.With the salary cap acting as a counterweight to the financial muscle of some and the weakness of others, coaching helps make a difference. The Exiles have the former Ireland coach Declan Kidney in charge, backed up by Les Kiss, and their experience showed at Bristol where Irish in the first half only played in opposition territory and trusted their defensive line but in the second, with the prop Ollie Hoskins having been sent off, kept the ball in hand to minimise the impact of the missing brick in their wall. Pat Lam has done remarkably well at Bristol, but Kidney came out on top on Sunday with a coaching masterclass.The World Cup showed the difference high-calibre coaches make. Premier League football is going through one of its more frequently recurring phases where a few matches without a victory means questions are asked about a manager’s future, never mind that the riches enjoyed by that league mean that even the smallest club have the means to assemble a talented, competitive squad.An unsuccessful streak is seen as evidence that the players at that club are not good enough, but as Carwyn James observed before taking the 1971 Lions to New Zealand, where they were expected to come a distant second to the All Blacks, the successful coach makes his players believe they are better than they are. The reverse tends to be true at struggling sides.Leicester, after staring relegation in the face last season, should be wondering why they, and not Northampton, did not make a move for Chris Boyd, who coached the Hurricanes to the 2016 Super Rugby title. The New Zealander arrived in England just before the start of last season at the club that had been, in playing terms, the Premiership’s most conservative and risk-averse.Seeking contact rather than space had brought them success earlier in the decade, but that had long faded and they were muddling along in the bottom half before approaching a coach who encouraged players to look for space and play with their heads up. It took a while for players to acclimatise to the winds of change and when the Saints were beaten by Leicester at Twickenham 14 months ago, it was their 16th defeat in 22 Premiership matches: relegation form.They have won seven of their last nine and, if Boyd himself says there is still a way to go, and Saturday’s Champions Cup match at home to Leinster should reveal how far, they are far removed from the highly structured automatons that he inherited. Bath are another who should take note, a club not short on ability that play by numbers on a bog of a pitch.Unless Irish or Worcester collapse, a giant will go down. If the table reads the same with five rounds to go as it does now, they will be twitching in boardrooms. If it is hard to see anyone advocating ring-fencing to prevent Saracens from dropping into the Championship, although clubs who told Saracens to accept their punishment and not appeal should now take their own advice and regard that matter as closed while Premiership Rugby polices this season’s cap, but Leicester, and their army of fans, going down would be another matter. The cost would be felt by everyone.Do Leicester, a club whose slow, steady decline became precipitous because problems were not addressed, deserve saving? This could be the most enthralling, ghoulish relegation battle yet, an attraction the Pro14 lacks. In France, Stade Français are bottom of the pile in the Top 14, the grandees laid low, and with the recent investment into the game something could be done about bolstering the Championship to better prepare teams for promotion.Bristol could have gone back to the top of the table on Sunday on points difference from Northampton. Lam still has work to do, but he was an inspired appointment. What separates the top from the bottom (taking out Saracens) is coaching: the right appointment provides a better return than any marquee player.• This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

It’s this element of surprise that makes their productions so much fun – and not just for the kids. This year, Hiccup and co-producer Derby theatre are taking us into the deepest, darkest depths of the Big Bad Wolf’s belly, where Grandma lies after being swallowed whole. But this madcap show is such a winner that, as the end approaches, I can’t help hoping Grandma stays down there a little longer.The same creative team behind last year’s Goldilocks and the Three Bears have reunited, and they bounce off each other with ease and skill. Sarah Brigham’s script is full of clever twists (is that Little Red Riding Hood climbing inside the Wolf’s mouth?) and witty dialogue, with some particularly great gags for Bethan Morgan’s channel-swimming, circus-joining Grandma. Ivan Stott’s songs have a glowing energy to them, his lyrics are as sharp as ever, and dramaturg Sarah Argent makes sure the storytelling is crystal clear.There’s a slapdash charm to the small ensemble of actors, who function as storytellers, puppeteers, musicians, comics and anything else you might fancy. Half the time they look as though they’re making things up on the spot – and just happen to be very, very good. Sam Wilde’s set initially looks a bit cobbled together but, like Red Riding Hood herself, is much cleverer than first appears. There are countless visuals to savour but the image that will stay with me is a puppet-sized Grandma trapped in the Wolf’s stomach (a wardrobe swung wide open), swinging from some tonsils fashioned out of a red bra."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/298e5e6b0fae08398de24318f65f175e22b7382b/0_377_5656_3394/master/5656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9f515132ced9e6aef55cf5b23ca131b","title":"secret vault room edinburgh new hostel","story":"A centuries’ old vault has been turned into a ‘very well soundproofed’ room at a new hostel in the Scottish capital How does a hostel stand out from the crowd? Sometimes by embracing novelty. A former courthouse in London threw off the shackles to become Clink in Reykjavik the crumbs of a biscuit factory were swept away to create Kex and in Amsterdam, one of the city’s most famous brothels has a new life as Cocomama. Now, an Edinburgh hostel looks to be upping the ante by turning what was once a secret vault into a room with just enough space for a double bed behind the original six-inch steel safe door.What has become the Vault room – a mere 3.2 sq m, and retaining its foot-thick walls – was discovered by architects during redevelopment work at a former fruit and vegetable market in the Scottish capital’s Old Town. It is now set to act as a showpiece room in the new 139-bed hostel, part of the St Christopher’s Inn chain, which opened in late November.Described as “very well soundproofed”, the Vault’s hefty door is said to weigh more than a tonne, though any jangling nerves should to be calmed by news it has been welded open to avoid trapping travellers. The room features specially designed wallpaper that depicts rows of safety deposit boxes and has a safe that serves as a fun, in-room gaming experience. An en suite bathroom has been fitted outside the vault door. Designed in conjunction with local escape room specialist Escape Reality, the challenge is to crack the code of the safe and in the process release some goodies for your stay.“The entire room is basically a large, walk-in safe,” according to Sophie Herbert, marketing director of St Christopher’s Inns’ parent company Beds and Bars. “Our best guess is that it was a vault for cash takings from the days when the site was a flourishing fruit and veg market serving the city. Certainly, it would have been almost impregnable.”The new hostel, which is opposite the existing St Christopher’s Inn property and close to the city’s Waverley station, is in a two-storey structure on Market Street that dates back to the late 1800s. Its 139 beds are spread across 18 rooms that have been themed around different areas of the city. There are private rooms, such as the Vault, and dorms for up to 12 people. Prices for beds start from £9.90 a night B\u0026ampB in low season to £68 a night B\u0026ampB for a private double in high season.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

A simple play on words told us everything about the impeachment inquiry, the current mindset in Congress and the state of the nation.The witness Pamela Karlan cracked a joke that delighted liberals and infuriated conservatives. Or rather, it delighted conservatives because it gave them a talking point to whip up outrage.The afternoon session of the House judiciary committee hearing on the constitutional framework for impeachment had just begun when the Democratic congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee posed the question: “What comparisons can we make between kings that the framers were afraid of and the president’s conduct today?”“I will give you one example that shows the difference between him and a king, which is: the constitution says there can be no titles of nobility. While the president can name his son Barron, he can’t make him a baron.”Jackson Lee smiled and there was laughter in the big and ornate committee room, where two carved eagles look down under the words “E pluribus unum” (out of many, one) and a dozen uniformed Capitol police lent an air of a courtroom drama. Karlan’s point echoed Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s recent opinion, cited at Wednesday’s hearing, that “the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that presidents are not kings”.But could we forgive the pun? Not when the president’s son, tall but only 13 years of age, was involved. Republicans’s well-oiled fury machine clicked straight into gear. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, tweeted: “Classless move by a Democratic ‘witness’. Prof Karlan uses a teenage boy who has nothing to do with this joke of a hearing (and deserves privacy) as a punchline.”The Trump 2020 election campaign demanded Karlan personally apologise to the president and first lady. Back in the room, the Trump loyalist Matt Gaetz expressed righteous indignation. “When you invoke the president’s son’s name here, when you try to make a little joke out of referencing Barron Trump, that does not lend credibility to your argument,” he told Karlan. Like Jim Jordan and Elise Stefanik in the intelligence committee hearings, Gaetz would have known that clip has plenty of potential for replays on Fox News and rightwing social media, bashing the left as vengeful and in the throes of “Trump derangement syndrome”.As the clock ticked past half-five, the hearing learned, with an audible gasp, that Melania Trump herself had weighed in, tweeting: “A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics. Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it.”Karlan apologised. “It was wrong of me to do that,” she told the hearing. “I regret having said that.”The ision over this pun – a laugh line to some, evidence of liberal sneering to others – cut to the chase of yet another hopelessly polarised hearing. Facts mattered less than being on the winning team. It made one wonder whether Americans don’t even laugh at the same jokes any more.Three of the witnesses, including Karlan, had been called by Democrats to testify that the evidence gathered regarding Trump’s dealings with Ukraine meets the historical definition of impeachment. The other witness had been called by Republicans. Few Democratic or Republican politicians put a question to a witness from the other side.Democrats got plenty of ammunition. Representative Steve Cohen laid out an ABC – Abuse of power, Betrayal of the national interest and Corruption of elections – and asked if Trump had achieved the trifecta. “Yes,” replied all three Democratic witnesses. Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor, said: “I just want to stress that if what we’re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable.”But their opponents worked tirelessly to argue that their witnesses were partisan ivory tower-dwellers and therefore ignorable in this “sham” and “farce”. The Republican witness was Jonathan Turley, who was somewhat measured, opining that Trump’s phone call with the Ukrainian president “was anything but perfect”. But the George Washington University law professor said: “One can oppose President Trump’s policies or actions but still conclude that the current legal case for impeachment is not just woefully inadequate, but in some respects dangerous.”There were also some structural problems for Democrats in the all-important court of public opinion. At hearings like Wednesday’s, they have to take turns with Republicans, which creates an impression of equivalence: first let’s put the case for the world being round, now let’s hear the case that it’s flat.So before some empty seats in the press and public galleries, members continued to talk past each other. For those still watching at home, the alternatives were sleep or, after the TV newsman Howard Beale in the film Network, to cry out: “I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not going to take this any more!”Turley had an answer for that too. “I get it. You’re mad,” he said. “The president’s mad. My Republican friends are mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog seems mad. And Luna’s a goldendoodle, and they don’t get mad. So we’re all mad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7391d997476d73f8017d525a5a07504327e676fc/0_256_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35118a7a87625bf55ebdc5d6fd3e8e5f","title":"new hampshire 2020 election student vote","story":"‘They are kids voting liberal,’ a New Hampshire Republican said in 2011 as legal battle over student voting in the state continuesMaggie Flaherty grew up in a small town in California, but after she moved to New Hampshire to attend Dartmouth College, she registered to vote in the state where she would be spending at least four years.Now she is embroiled in a fight against Republicans in the state that is being watched across the country.Flaherty and a fellow student are challenging a Republican-backed law that is making it harder for many out-of-state students and other temporary residents to cast a ballot in a state with outsized national influence.New Hampshire is a small swing state where both local and state-wide races can be decided by razor-thin margins. Donald Trump lost the state to Hillary Clinton by just 2,736 votes in 2016. The same year, Maggie Hassan, also a Democrat, defeated Kelly Ayotte for a Senate seat by just 1,017 votes. The Democratic primary in February and general election in November are expected to be closely fought.Republicans in the state have complained about college students voting before. “They are kids voting liberal, voting their feelings, with no life experience,” William O’Brien, a Republican and then the New Hampshire house speaker, said in 2011. There are nationwide efforts to restrict the surging student vote, but the party says the new law is merely intended to bring New Hampshire in line with other states.The law, which went into effect on 1 July, mandates that anyone who has registered to vote and intends to drive while living in the state must obtain a New Hampshire driver’s license and register their vehicle within 60 days of signing up.The ACLU of New Hampshire, which is bringing the suit, contends that in fact many states allow out-of-state students and other transient people, such as military personnel, to vote and exempts them from the requirement to get an in-state license, said the ACLU lawyer Gilles Bissonnette.It may seem like a benign change, but critics of the law say it has created mass confusion and imposes an unfair burden on college students, and amounts to a “poll tax” on voting because of the costs involved in getting a license. “There’s nothing that’s really gained by this, there’s no way to really enforce it, so what’s the point of it?” said Kate Corriveau, the New Hampshire director of America Votes, an advocacy group. “The point of it, as we’ve kind of seen, is that it’s confusing. And it’s a little bit intimidating.”It is also not clear how New Hampshire officials will check and enforce whether new voters with out-of-state documents get an in-state license. That uncertainty could deter students from signing up to get on the voter rolls, said Joseph Ramirez, a senior at the University of New Hampshire who has worked to educate people about the new law. “It’s almost like a scare tactic,” he said. “I’ve heard things like if you’re going to get pulled over, then they might fine you” if you have an out-of-state license, he said.Warren’s campaign said in a court filing that the law was so confusing that her campaign could not advise college students on what they should do if they have an out-of-state license and want to vote in New Hampshire.“We’re here to say two things: principle, everybody ought to be able to vote, but the second part is to say we have evidence that it’s causing a great deal of confusion,” Warren told New Hampshire Public Radio in November. “And when you’ve got confusion, you suppress voting.”In his Wednesday ruling, LaPlante denied that the law was confusing and pointed to a November memo from New Hampshire officials outlining how it would work. Still, LaPlante asked the New Hampshire supreme court to clarify several aspects of the law, only adding to the uncertainty. The court could interpret the law in a way that is less restrictive to the students. Flaherty, who is hoping to help students register to vote regardless of the decision, said students shouldn’t be penalized for wanting to vote.“We fall into this unique category of wanting to be engaged, being informed people that are getting a higher education, but also we don’t know where we’re going to be,” she said. “We’re in kind of a limbo.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/393799743016a26bc93ed856980da7075dba7bbc/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4ee61bc38e43057b31518589c86be40","title":"pete buttigieg mckinsey business democratic 2020","story":"The centrist Democratic candidate has surged in the polls but critics from the left are suspicious about his time at the controversial management consultancyPete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old South Bend mayor and Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, has seen a recent surge in polling in early-voting primary states. But with his candidacy apparently gaining ground, activists and campaigners on the left are increasingly sounding the alarm over his progressive bona fides.Buttigieg, considered a moderate within the crowded field, has made clear on the debate stage that he would not pursue the major structural reforms advocated by his fellow candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, whose platforms are considered more left-leaning.Activists have accused Buttigieg of being overly reliant on wealthy donors. They also say he is insufficiently committed to racial justice, noting his lack of support among black voters. And they worry that his past – particularly the three years he spent right out of Harvard and Oxford universities working for McKinsey \u0026amp Company, the world’s largest management consultancy firm – show his interests are aligned with big business.Nate Levin-Aspenson, co-founder of the South Bend chapter of Inisible, a grassroots liberal group that sprang up in response to Donald Trump’s election, calls Buttigieg’s decision to work for the firm “mercenary”.“What people do with their time and talent is a demonstration of their values. And Pete, for all his baggage, is objectively a smart man with a fair amount of talent, and right out of school he chose to go and work for McKinsey. And that says something,” said Levin-Aspenson. “It’s kind of a mercenary thing to do that doesn’t reflect any personal priority beyond career advancement.”Secrecy surrounds much of the work of McKinsey, seen by many as the gold standard in management consulting. While it has worked with Fortune 500 companies, it has also been accused by the Massachusetts attorney general of fanning the flames of the opioid epidemic by advising Purdue Pharma on how to “turbocharge” sales of the drug, and it has worked to expand the influence of authoritarian regimes such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. In his book The Firm: The Story of McKinsey and Its Secret Influence on American Business, Duff McDonald wrote that McKinsey “may be the single greatest legitimizer of mass layoffs”.Buttigieg has said he was unaware of McKinsey’s work for Purdue Pharma at the time and that its role advising the company was “upsetting”. But for his critics, the details of Buttigieg’s McKinsey work that have been released – including that he studied grocery pricing, and that he traveled to Afghanistan and Iraq as part of his McKinsey work – invite questions.Buttigieg cannot disclose what projects he worked on while at McKinsey from June 2007 to March 2010 because of confidentiality agreements. His campaign has contacted McKinsey to clarify what the NDA encompasses, and again separately about whether he might be released from it.Buttigieg’s campaign notes that he has recently released his tax returns from his time at McKinsey and is working with the firm to release even more information about his time there. A spokesman said that Buttigieg has often noted that he disagrees with many of the decisions made by McKinsey and pointed to sections of the candidate’s book, Shortest Way Home, including one where he talks about the moment he realized working for corporate clients “could not be his career for very long” because although “I liked my clients and my colleagues, delivering for them could not furnish that deep level of purpose that I craved”.Asked recently about his time at McKinsey, Buttigieg responded similarly. “I think it’s important that I have private-sector experience,” he told reporters on his Iowa campaign bus in early November. “Certainly my professional experience, for the most part, has been public service, so I’m happy to speak to it because I think it is important to have a president who understands how things work in the business world. But obviously I hadn’t been in it for very long before I decided to walk away from it for public service.”Buttigieg’s consulting background contrasts with other frontrunners in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, such as Warren, who came from academia, and Sanders and the former vice-president Joe Biden, both career politicians. Last month the California senator and former candidate Kamala Harris, who faced her own criticisms from the party’s progressive wing as she positioned herself to compete with Buttigieg for centrist voters wary of a weak Biden candidacy, also sought to draw a contrast between his background and hers. “For my entire career, I’ve only had one client: The People,” she tweeted following news Buttigieg would release tax returns from his time at McKinsey.Buttigieg has previously said his time at the firm helped him more fully realize a desire to work in public service. But critics say he remains a business-first candidate. At a time when the party is increasingly hostile to corporate actors, for instance, Buttigieg has continued to oppose the Medicare-for-All-style system favored by Sanders and Warren, which would replace the privately owned healthcare system with a government-run one.“The fundamental question in politics is whose side are you on, who are you fighting for?” said Adam Green of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren for president. “Working at McKinsey would be fine if he was now challenging corporate interests like big tech and big insurance companies. But the fact that he’s adopting policies that help them and, in the case of Medicare for All, using industry talking points to attack other Democrats – that’s what makes people ask: is there something about his past work that’s baked in?”When it’s been politically advantageous to him, Buttigieg has talked up his work at McKinsey. As a candidate for state treasurer of Indiana in 2010, for instance, he told a forum sponsored by Tea Party-aligned groups that he knew how to stabilize economies. And after he lost that election, his McKinsey background and friendly relationship with the business community helped him when he went back home to run for mayor and became the first mayoral candidate the local Chamber of Commerce had ever endorsed.Nelini Stamp, national organizing director for the Working Families party, which has also endorsed Warren, feels Buttigieg hasn’t done enough to reconcile that past self with his present candidacy. “It’s one thing to say, ‘This is what I did and it was a job and I’ve seen the wrongdoings,’ like when Senator Warren explains why she was a Republican and how she changed, because she actually studied bankruptcy and realized it was not on the iniduals, it was on the corporations,” Stamp said.“If you’re going to distance yourself from it,” she added of his McKinsey background, “own it and say why.”Now Buttigieg describes his work for McKinsey as “not something that I think is essential in my story”, and many – including Matt Bennett of the center-left thinktank Third Way – agree.“Rigid orthodoxy and litmus-test politics are a recipe for losing presidential elections and minority status in Congress,” he said. “Some on the far left claim that anyone in Democratic politics who doesn’t share all of their views is an apostate who is controlled by ‘corporate interests’. But that’s offensive and ridiculous.“Pete Buttigieg opposes Medicare for All for the same reason that Nancy Pelosi, Sherrod Brown and almost every Democrat who flipped a House seat in 2018 oppose it – it’s bad policy and terrible politics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea82d60445b7df14bea1b0a9726342cdbf8632b0/0_1043_1154_691/master/1154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d66c225bb393aedce6786f8b68f1af9a","title":"all you want for christmas the high street can deliver","story":"As fairy lights and carols provide the backdrop to your hunt for the perfect gift,  Sophie Benson tells us why it’s the most wonderful time of the year to embrace your local high streetWhen the clocks go back and the afternoons begin to melt into night earlier and earlier, a comforting memory always comes back to me: it’s a late-night shopping Thursday and I’m sitting in a cafe, its walls lined with yellowing newspaper, munching on a croissant with my dad as we both warm up after spending a couple of hours wandering the fairy-lit high street in search of Christmas gifts.What did I buy on that outing? I honestly can’t remember, but it’s the experience that stays with me bundling up in mittens, hat and scarf, walking down damp cobbled streets, the Christmas lights reflected in the puddles between them, and meandering in and out of shops without any real gift in mind, just the hope that the right thing was sitting on a shelf waiting to be found.Now, approximately 20 years later, I still love to head off by myself for a few hours, particularly early in the morning or late in the evening, to soak up the festive atmosphere among the other Christmas shoppers. I set off with a list (a heading for each recipient, with a list of likes, hobbies and possible gifts beneath) and make a point of enjoying myself and savouring the experience. Rather than getting caught up in a panicked, gift-finding frenzy, I like to go at my own pace, venture off the beaten track and take my time picking through what’s on offer at each of my favourite local, independent shops on the high street.I don’t make a beeline for a specific gift instead I linger at each shelf, thumbing through books and smelling every candle. I might not end up buying the organic cotton dressing gown I hold up in front of the mirror or the pair of handmade earrings I gawp at through the cabinet glass, but I still love to browse and see what unexpectedly perfect gift might jump out at me.This spirit of discovery extends to finding new shops too. I’m notorious for “discovering” a new place only to be told that it’s been there for years. Stumbling upon a shop that’s new to me down a side street or following a sign to a tiny, almost-hidden entrance is a treat no matter how long the shop has been there. I adore finding another place to add to my roster, run by someone who cares about the local area and wants to make it a home for their business.I’m not alone in my love of gift hunting on the high street. A survey earlier this year from Visa found that the local high street remains our preferred shopping destination, despite the many different options now available. The draw of the beautifully decorated windows, the Christmas songs on repeat (yes, I love each and every one of them) and the personal experience remain hard to resist.Not only do I love the experience of the day itself, but the people make it special too. Despite the festive rush, I’ve never found myself short on help or advice. There have been plenty of times that a helpful shopkeeper, who’s noticed me circling and sighing, has come to my rescue. When I struggled to pick out a gift for a friend and colleague (who just so happened to have recently given me a wonderfully thoughtful gift that I was finding hard to match), the sales assistant in one of my favourite sustainable boutiques took the time to chat to me. She asked what my friend’s style is, what her hobbies are and what she tends to buy for other people. I left with an ostensibly mismatched but flawlessly suited bundle that included posh vegan sweets and a pin badge. She loved it.Because so many local high street shops handpick their stock, they know it back to front. They’ll tell you all about the maker, their backstory and their values. They’ll reveal all the subtly special things about a gift that in turn will make it even more special to the person who receives it. How lovely to know that a maker only uses recycled materials, for example, and then giving it to someone who does the same in their own life. Or consider how charming it is to give someone a gift made in the town where they grew up. Without attentive, considerate shopkeepers, these extra details would go overlooked and a sweet point of connection could be missed.When the provenance and details of a gift mean so much to the person selling them, so too does the sale. I adore seeing my purchase handwritten in a sales ledger and knowing that it’s significant to the person behind the till. Supporting community businesses, finding unique, personal gifts and getting festive shopping locally brings it all together for me.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3df093759b10d1d0f167dabc1e082aa2c82505e/0_200_2344_1407/master/2344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292d0f92de1577fc230e642996187a9b","title":"board games books and brand new clothes a guide to christmas shopping in your local charity shop","story":"They’re the cornerstone of every high street – guaranteed to have an eclectic mix of everything from clothes to homeware. Here are the top Christmas gifts to look out for when you next pop in to a thrift shopAs shopping, and living, sustainably becomes a focus for more and more people, this Christmas is the perfect time to turn to your local charity shops for your festive shopping. Not only will you give what you buy a new lease of life, you’ll support your local economy and share the benefits of shopping secondhand. To give you some inspiration, we’ve rounded up the best gifts you can expect to find in your local charity shop.Winter warmersFrom oversized turtlenecks in fun primary colours to neat cardigans and always-appropriate V-necks, charity shops are a goldmine for knitwear, particularly around the time wardrobes are being cleared to make way for (carefully pre-specified) Christmas gifts. Let their castoffs become your festive finds. You’ll save pounds compared with what you would spend on a new item and you’re more likely to find something unique, so your giftee won’t have to worry about running into someone else wearing the same thing.Board gamesChristmas wouldn’t be Christmas without a good board game to bring everyone together or, indeed, ide them … Monopoly and Scrabble are mainstays in most charity shops but there’s plenty others to suit everyone. Take your pick from the likes of Risk, Trivial Pursuit and Cluedo, as well as a plethora of TV- and film-themed games and the latest releases.Bestselling booksAlongside some wonderfully weird 1970s recipe books, you’ll find scores of bestselling titles on charity shop bookshelves. Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Philip Pullman and John Grisham are all regulars, and you’ll find plenty of new authors such as Sally Rooney and David Chariandy too. While some titles may be a few years old, it’s not unusual to find the latest must-read on the shelves, and keep your eyes peeled for signed editions for an extra-special touch.Chintzy chinaFrom cocktails served in teacups to unusual teapots becoming a major home decor trend, the popularity of chintzy, vintage china is on the rise. You’ll discover shelves worth of it in almost any charity shop you walk into. It’s the perfect gift for someone who likes their homeware kitsch. Why not use a floral teacup as a holder for a homemade candle?Classic recordsWith vinyl records increasing in popularity, why not make a beeline for your nearest charity shop as they have plenty on offer. As digital formats took over, people turned to charity shops to free up their once-straining shelves and, because vinyl was donated in such abundance, many charity shops sell records for as little as 25p. You can expect to find everything from classical and krautrock to electronica and soul.Brand-new clothesWe all know someone who’s a little squeamish about the idea of secondhand clothes. But luckily for thrifty gift-givers, charity shops are not only stocked with vintage finds and pre-loved pieces, they’re also home to a huge amount of brand-new, unworn clothes. A quick rifle through the rails of your local charity shop will reveal a whole host of clothes with the original tags still attached. You’ll find everything from bold, printed T-shirts and floaty maxi dresses to jeans and shirts. There’s an abundance of high street labels waiting to be found and, if you’re lucky, you might just stumble across a designer piece.Vintage sewing patternsMore than a million people have taken up sewing over the past few years, with sales of sewing patterns soaring. However, with some patterns costing as much as we’re used to paying for a fully finished garment, the prices involved can be off-putting. To keep the crafty person in your life stitching, have a rifle through the baskets of vintage sewing patterns you often find tucked away underneath shelves. Selling for as little as 50p, you could buy enough to keep them busy until next Christmas.Statement jewelleryYou don’t have to go to an expensive boutique to find the perfect piece of jewellery – there’s plenty to be found in charity shops and they won’t break the bank. Take your pick from delicate vintage brooches, strings of pearls (likely faux, but you never know), oversized earrings, watches and cufflinks. The shelves are full to bursting with an assortment of jewellery that will suit everyone from your best friend to your grandma.Toiletry gift setsOnce a reasonably priced option for a secret Santa, toiletry gift sets seem to get more and more expensive each year. Rather than splashing out, see what’s on offer in your local charity shop. While some people may be worried about buying lotions and potions secondhand, charity shops are very savvy with their stock. Anything opened doesn’t make the shelves and many branches keep high street gift guides from the last couple of years in stock so they can cross-check whether a set is in date or not.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/2810_672_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641c6a1f2409434d9c09472aa8a21693","title":"weve become like a little family of shops we look out for one another","story":"For Karen Harvey, her shop Hoos is fulfilling a lifelong passion for Scandi design while also breathing welcome new life into her local area, writes  Malcolm Jack “I often get people coming in and asking me what the name of the shop means,” smiles Karen Harvey, founder and owner of Hoos. “Everyone thinks it’s Danish or something. It’s actually just how you say ‘house’ in Scotland,” she laughs, “it’s just a bit of fun.”Be that as it may, it’s a name that captures a lot about what makes Glasgow’s haven of gorgeous Nordic homeware such a unique delight to visit. Both in terms of its synergy of fine Scandi and Scottish design (“hus”, pronounced the same way as Hoos, happens to be the word for “house” in the three main Scandinavian languages), and also its welcoming sense of warmth and character. Never more so than in the run-up to Christmas, when Harvey and her staff embrace the rich northern European tradition of bringing cosy light and comfort to long, dark winter nights, with their twinkling decorations and friendly, personalised approach to helping customers pick just the right presents for family and friends.Home has been at the heart of 63-year-old Harvey’s entire working life, in different ways. For 30 years she lived in Suffolk, leading two charities that did revolutionary things in improving the lives, living circumstances and futures of vulnerable young people (she received an MBE for her services). A mixture of professional and personal circumstances led her back to her native Glasgow a few years ago, where she decided to take an entirely new career direction.“I’ve always had an interest in interiors and design, even though that’s not my background at all,” Harvey explains. “Scandinavian design has always been my sort of personal aesthetic, so when I was thinking: ‘OK, what brands do I want to do?’ they were the only ones for me.” She leased small premises on, at that time, a dilapidated stretch of Great Western Road, just off the west end of Glasgow’s central artery Byres Road, and with the support of her architect partner Bill, cleverly transformed the compact space into an immaculately laid out, bright and inviting oasis of select hard and soft furnishings, cool kitchen and tableware, lush green house plants, stylish rainwear, handmade fashion accessories and other assorted pretty things.Starting a new business in a new sector would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but Harvey took it in her stride. “I had to go to Copenhagen and be interviewed by some of the brands, because they’re very particular about what kind of shops they’re going in to,” Harvey reveals. She evidently impressed, because Hoos has become one of the few stockists in the UK for a host of hip makers such as Hay, Normann Copenhagen and Skagerak, to name just a few. “Most of my jewellery is by Glasgow School of Art graduates,” Harvey explains. “We also do textiles by Scottish makers. You’re not going to find these kinds of things in any other store either.”Business is going strong for Hoos, as it helps lead a local high street revival. Harvey is passionate about fostering a thriving community along Great Western Road, which has seen a host of great vintners, victuallers, boutiques, bookshops, bakers and cafes breathe new life into a historic strip of retail premises. She’s involved with Love Great Western Road, a Business Improvement District (BID) proposal encouraging local businesses to work collectively for a brighter, more prosperous commercial future. “It’s helped us to get to know one another,” Harvey says of BID. “We’ve become like a little family of shops – we look out for one another.”As well as local retailers pulling together to support each other, they all rely on their customers doing the same. By reminding people #WhereYouShopMatters, Visa is championing local, independent retailers to help restore richly deserved focus and footfall to our high streets. Not only because our high streets are at the heart of our communities, but also because great independent traders can offer unique and enriching retail experiences, where staff take a hands-on approach to helping you select special things for yourself and for the important people in your life. Shops like Hoos are working hard to not only redefine what it means to be a small, independent trader in the digital age, but also help revitalise our high streets for a new generation, and they deserve to be shouted about for it.“I’m really encouraged by Visa’s #WhereYouShopMatters initiative,” says Hoos’s Karen Harvey, “because it brings businesses like ours to people’s attention. Particularly among younger people, who I think are the ones who increasingly do most of their shopping online. If it brings Hoos to their attention for maybe the first time, obviously that’s fab. And then they’ll come to Great Western Road more often and see all the other fabulous shops too.”Here are some of Harvey’s top tips for great Christmas shopping experiences in her local area:Love and Squalor“A small shop just past Kelvinbridge. Rebecca is the owner and she sells clothes that she handmakes herself. So it’s like going back to how it used to be many years ago. She also buys in things such as wonderful socks and lovely Irish scarves, blankets and candles. It’s just a really nice experience going in there.”427 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, G4 9JACottonrake Bakery“A fabulous independent bakery, doing wonderful bread, cakes and bakes. In the run-up to Christmas they do all kinds of special things such as Christmas jams and other nice little presents. We feel extremely lucky to have them nearby.”497 Great Western Road, G12 8HLPaulin Watches“Everyone loves a watch – particularly a handmade one. Paulin’s designs are beautiful.

The growing complexity of the organisation required Nato leaders to negotiate with Turkey, which had refused to sign off updated plans to defend the Baltic states against Russia unless Nato agreed to designate the Kurdish Syrian YPG as terrorists.This time, diplomacy appears to have succeeded, and Ankara signed up to a new defence plan for Russia’s nervous western neighbours. But it was an uncomfortable reminder how an increasingly assertive ally – with the second-largest armed forces in the organisation – can exert influence, potentially affecting the security of others far away.Despite this, Nato’s focus continues to spread. The summit is the first time its leaders have considered the rise of China, which has never been a focus for the organisation they also confirmed that it was time for Nato to have a military presence in space, and they worried about cyberwarfare and Russian disinformation.But just as the UK debates leaving the EU, Nato is, prompted by Macron’s outburst, deciding itself how to “strengthen its political dimension” – or to put it another way, how it can insulate itself against an erratic US president who nobody is totally sure would defend a fellow ally after the abandonment of the Syrian Kurds.This has been a triumph of sorts for White House diplomacy – not least because at the last summit in Brussels last year, a belligerent US president had threatened to “go it alone” if other countries did not spend more.In London, Trump threatened to launch trade wars against “delinquent” states not prepared to spend more on arms, then petulantly decided to cancel a press conference – almost certainly to the delight of Johnson’s Downing Street, a week before an election – claiming a “two-faced” Justin Trudeau had joked about him at Buckingham Palace the night before.But the events of the last two days also serve to underline that Nato is becoming an ever more complex organisation whose persistent squabbling means that questions will linger over precisely how effective it would be in the unlikely event collective military defence would ever be required."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0aa6736b644bd56cb1a227436c2fa0bf465bc85/0_0_1711_1027/master/1711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b348b37f62b1585cbc105778162b021b","title":"canada asbestos town renaming plan","story":"Officials acknowledged proposed rebranding is ‘difficult decision’ but important for community’s economic survivalThings haven’t been easy for the Canadian town of Asbestos. Eight years ago, its largest mine shut down, leaving behind unemployment and a mile-wide empty crater next to the downtown core.But the community in the French-speaking province of Quebec has also been forced to reckon with that fact that it shares its name with a notorious cancer-causing mineral banned in nearly 60 countries.Amid growing frustration from residents, officials have launched a bold plan: renaming the town.For nearly 150 years, the Jeffrey asbestos mine in the town east of Montreal was one of the world’s largest – and the biggest employer in town. Over the years, however, as experts learned of the dangers associated with asbestos, the town’s name has become somewhat tarnished.“The word asbestos unfortunately doesn’t have a good connotation, especially for anglophones, and it’s hindering the city’s plans to develop external economic relations,” said the town in a Facebook post, prompting some residents to bristle at the idea of changing the town’s name for the benefit of English-speaking businesspeople. Others expressed frustration that the town was abandoning its heritage.The new effort marks the second time Asbestos has tried to rebrand itself. In 2006 town councillors proposed the idea but received little support. While the current attempt will probably cost nearly $100,000, there is hope the contest will bring attention – and potential investment – to the region.Some residents have advocated names that pay homage to the region, including City of Three Lakes. Other suggested reaching out to Indigenous groups to guidance on the traditional names for the region.Most, however, have been tongue-in-cheek, including Poumontousse (a portmanteau of “lung” and “cough”), the Hole and Asbestos 2.0.Asbestos plans to hold public meetings in early January before voting on the new name."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b61b00ba210ed5509f49ffba11d22176d91c8fe/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=046cbd613ff6a5e9af92fc854da080d7","title":"france braces for biggest strike of emmanuel macron presidency","story":"Rail and air transport as well as schools and policing hit by walkouts over pension changesEmmanuel Macron is facing the biggest strikes of his presidency, as French rail workers, air-traffic controllers, teachers and public sector staff staged walkouts and took to the streets against proposed changes to the pension system.Many schools were closed and even some police unions warned of “symbolic” closures of certain police stations. Shops along the route of a march in Paris were advised to close in case of violence on the edges of the demonstration.About half of the scheduled Eurostar trains between Paris and London have been cancelled. Tourists were turned away at the Eiffel Tower because of the strike.The standoff is a crucial test for the centrist French president, whose planned overhaul of the pensions system was a key election promise.The government argues that unifying the pensions system – and getting rid of the 42 “special” regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Paris Opera staff – is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the French population ages. But unions say introducing a “universal” system for all will mean millions of workers in both the public and private sectors must work beyond the legal retirement age of 62 or face a severe drop in the value of their pensions.The row cuts to the heart of Macron’s presidential project and his pledge to deliver the biggest transformation of the French social model and welfare system since the postwar era. Since his election in 2017, Macron has leaned towards a Nordic style of “flexi-security” in which the labour market is loosened and the focus is on changing from a rigid work code to a society of iniduals moving between jobs.Pension reform is the latest step for Macron after he overhauled labour rules and changed the unemployment system, but it has always been an extremely sensitive topic in France.Unusually, the protest strike is going ahead before the full details of any pensions changes are known. A consultation process is still under way and parliament will not debate proposals until 2020.Beyond trade unions, there is an angry grassroots base of rail workers and other state workers keen to put pressure on the government. It is not certain how long the transport strike will continue.At Place de la République in central Paris, Didier Dupir from Lyon was among firefighters from the Sud trade union staging an unusual protest by sleeping outside in tents despite freezing temperatures.He was protesting over staffing levels, remuneration and pensions. “I’ve been a firefighter for 20 years and I’ve never slept out on a demonstration like this before,” he said. “This is about getting proper recognition from the government for what firefighters do. People are very sensitive to the state of public services.”Stewart Chau, a sociologist and consultant for Viavoice pollsters, said the public mood was of distrust rather than defiance, with people wanting pension reform but not confident in the government to carry it out.Chau said that since the gilets jaunes protests, Macron’s top-down approach to changing the French system had altered, with the government now appearing to engage in more public consultation. The challenge for the president was to balance a need for pensions changes and structural reform “while not appearing to force the changes through which could amplify the protests or generate a sense of social fracture, with different grievances joining up together”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1468ec32e2df3020a758c848b949b7b79d1e8c9/0_170_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e17659e75fbf93477b97459f4c4c5d6","title":"help us locate benin bronze statues in the uk","story":"We would like to start locating these objects and mapping their journeys to Britain – and we need your helpJesus College Cambridge has agreed to return a Benin bronze statue to Nigeria, after it was taken by British colonial forces from the country in the late nineteenth century.The artefact is set to be one of the first Benin bronzes returned to Nigeria, after thousands were stolen from Benin City in a punitive 1897 expedition by British forces.The decision to return the artefact comes after increasing scrutiny of the origins of our museum collections, and a growing movement to repatriate objects taken from former British colonies.Objects in national collections including the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA cannot be returned to their countries of origin because they are protected by the Heritage Act.

Photograph: Eric FeferbergAFP Air passengers travelling to and from France on Thursday are set to face serious disruptions as nationwide strikes kick off in response to pans to overhaul the French pension system.Public transport networks across France are due to almost completely shut down as French rail workers, public sector staff, air-traffic controllers and teachers take to the streets on Thursday. In Paris, 11 out of the 16 metro lines have shut completely while at least 90 per cent of regional trains have been cancelled. About half of scheduled Eurostar trains between Paris and London have also been cancelled.In Ireland, many passengers set to travel to France on Thursday are facing disruption as Aer Lingus and Ryanair announced flight cancellations throughout the day.In a statement posted on Wednesday evening, Ryanair apologised for the cancellation of a number of flights as a result of the air-traffic controller strikes. The airline said all affected customers had been notified of cancellations by text or email and were entitled to a free change of flight or refund. It advised customers who had not received a message that their flight should operate as scheduled.“We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by the national strike,” read the statement. “We will do everything we can to minimise your disruption, which is sadly beyond our control.”Aer Lingus flights EI524 from Dublin to Paris and EI525 from Paris to Dublin were also cancelled on Thursday as a result of the strikes with guests invited to re-book or request a refund.A statement from the airline said it planned to operate “the majority of our French flights” but warned of flight delays and “possible short-notice cancellations” to flights to and from French airports as well as those flying in French airspace.Further updates regarding Aer Lingus flights will be provided to guests via the website, text messages and social media, said the statement.Both airlines advised passengers travelling on Thursday and into the weekend to keep an eye on their flight status online.Easyjet and British Airways have also cancelled flights to and from France as a result of the strikes.Meanwhile in Paris, workers’ unions are planning a large-scale protest march through the capital on Thursday with police warning of possible violence and damage and ordered all business, cafes and restaurants along the route to close. French authorities issued a ban on protests on the Champs-Elysees, around the presidential palace, parliament and the Notre Dame cathedral.Police say they have deployed 6,000 police officers across Paris to help the city cope with the lack of transport and amid fears that yellow vest protest groups and extremist troublemakers could join the action."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4104631.1575496266!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"further blow for fai as three ireland opts not to renew sponsorship","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThree Ireland has decided not to renew its sponsorship with the embattled Football Association of Ireland (FAI).and Telecoms firm Three Ireland has announced that it is to end its decade-long sponsorship of the Football Association of Ireland (FAI), in a move that will add to the troubled sports organisation’s significant financial uncertainty.Three has, along with Toplion (UmbroNew Balance) been one of the FAI’s biggest backers. The basic value of the company’s support annually was put at €1.8 million when the partnership was last renewed in 2015.Three’s deal was due to expire in July and, in a statement on Wednesday, it said it had decided not to renew the contract when it ends.The company said it has supported Irish football for the last 10 years, investing €30 million in the game through a series of sponsorships and other measures.The announcement is the latest financial body blow to the FAI, which has been at the centre of a controversy since March after revelations about its finances and the relationship between it and former chief executive John Delaney.  Accounts The FAI is set to publish accounts on Friday detailing its finances for last year. The accounts, which will confirm the size of the exit package given to Mr Delaney earlier this year, are also expected to show a dramatic reversal in the organisation’s financial health. Sport Ireland referred an in-depth audit of the FAI’s accounts to the gardaí late last month.Three Ireland’s chief commercial officer Elaine Carey said the decision was taken after a review of its sponsorship portfolio. “At Three, we are entirely focussed on supporting the Irish men’s team through what we hope will be an exciting and successful qualification for the UEFA European Football Championship and the Irish Women’s team in their qualification for the the UEFA Women’s European Championship. We also wish the Irish teams at ever level the very best in the future.” Strategic reasons Three said the decision had been taken for strategic reasons and there was no reference to the recent troubles at the association “Having recently reviewed our full sponsorship portfolio,” said Carey, “we have decided to consolidate our sponsorship investment in the area of music”. The news comes just a day before the FAI is due to publish its accounts for 2018, the compilation of which has been severely delayed due to the many controversy that engulfed the association through the early part of the year and the lengthy re-examination of the organisation’s longer term finances that was embarked upon as a consequence. The notice given means that the FAI has eight months to find a replacement but it is hard to quantify the damage that has been done to its own brand and how that might affect the value of any subsequent deal with another company."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4104810.1575481400!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu leaders to discuss next phase of brexit at brussels summit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCurrent EU Brexit chief negotiator Michel Barnier: he has been reappointed to co-ordinate negotiations on the future relationship with the UK. Photograph: AP PhotoMichael SohnEU leaders have agreed to set aside time at their summit in Brussels next week to discuss launching the next phase of the Brexit process.Draft leaders’ conclusions obtained by The  reiterate the urgency of the “timely ratification” of the withdrawal agreement, and welcome the reappointment of current chief negotiator Michel Barnier to co-ordinate negotiations on the future relationship with the UK.A meeting of 27 EU leaders on Friday morning next week – minus the UK – will take place in the immediate aftermath of the British election on Thursday. It should be clear then after a night of counting whether prime minister Boris Johnson has the clear majority he needs to pass the withdrawal agreement, and the leaders will discuss any immediate challenges arising.The UK is due to leave the EU on January 31st if the Commons approves the withdrawal agreement, and then enters a transition period until the end of 2020, during which the old rulesrights still apply.If the withdrawal agreement is not approved by the end of January, the UK crashes out in a no-deal scenario or may be allowed another extension if sought.The draft conclusions say the EU “reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future relationship with the UK in line with the political declaration and respecting the previously agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations”.MandateTo that end the summit will mandate the commission to urgently propose a detailed mandate for the talks to the general affairs council of Europe ministers: “Negotiations should be organised in a way that makes the best possible use of the limited time available for negotiation and ratification by the end of the transition.”\u0026nbspThe aspiration to conclude such talks by the end of 2020 will be welcome in London, although there is no guarantee that the timeframe will actually be achieved.The leaders will charge the general affairs council, their ambassadors to the EU, and a specialist working group to oversee the negotiating process led by Mr Barnier “in a spirit of unity and transparency with all member states”, replicating the approach taken in the first phase of talks on the withdrawal agreement.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Philippe Lopez  Getty ImagesFrance’s public transport networks ground to a near halt on Thursday as unions dug in for a nationwide strike aimed at forcing president Emmanuel Macron to abandon plans to overhaul the country’s pension system.Railway and metro stations in Paris were largely deserted during the early commuter rush hour as commuters dusted off old bicycles, turned to carpooling rides or worked from home.Before sunrise, riot police deployed along the boutique-lined Champs Elysees boulevard, searching the bags of pedestrians ahead of a day of street protests which the government has warned may be infiltrated by violent groups.“Public transport will be very difficult today, as it will tomorrow and probably this weekend too,” junior transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari told RTL radio.The country-wide walkout by public workers is one of the biggest strikes in decades. Hard-left unions want to cripple transport networks, close schools and leave garbage piled high to force Mr Macron into retreat.The SNCF state railway says only one in 10 commuter and high-speed TGV trains will run. Train operators Eurostar and Thalys have cancelled at least half their services linking Paris with London and Brussels. The civil aviation authority asked airlines to cancel around 20 per cent of flights because of knock-on effects from the strike.More than half of all primary and secondary teachers are expected to walk out and hospital emergency rooms nationwide will operate on thin staffing. Transport unions have set no end-date for the strike.“What we’ve got to do is shut the economy down,” Christian Grolier, a senior official from the hard-left Force Ouvriere union, told Reuters. “People are spoiling for a fight.”Protesters will march from the capital’s Gare du Nord to Place de la Nation in the afternoon.Interior minister Christophe Castaner said thousands of anarchist “black bloc” and hardcore “yellow vest” protesters were expected to wreak havoc. He ordered shops along the route to close. Some 6,000 police will be deployed, including dozens of rapid-response officers on motorbikes.Social tensionsMr Macron wants to simplify France’s unwieldy pension system, which comprises more than 40 different plans, many with different retirement ages and benefits. Macron says the system is unfair and too costly.He wants a single, points-based system under which for each euro contributed, every pensioner has equal rights.Past attempts at pension reform have ended badly. Former president Jacques Chirac’s conservative government in 1995 caved into union demands after weeks of crippling protests.Twenty-four years later, the looming standoff is a risky venture for France’s hard-left unions who have seen membership and public support wane in recent years.They are battling to remain relevant against a president who has faced down waves of strikes over reforms of the labour market and SNCF railways.For Mr Macron, the showdown will set the tone for the second half of his mandate, with more difficult reforms to come, including to unemployment benefits.The strikes follow months of sometimes violent “yellow vest” over the high cost of living and perceived elitism of political class.Laurent Berger, head of the reform-minded CFDT union, said the social environment was more explosive than in 1995.“In terms of tension, social cohesion and fractures within society, it’s a lot worse now,” Mr Berger told Reuters.A poll last month by Viavoice for Libération found 89 per cent of French people felt France was experiencing a “social crisis”.Stewart Chau, a sociologist and consultant for Viavoice pollsters, said the public mood was of distrust rather than defiance, with people wanting pension reform but not confident in the government to carry it out. “What’s certain is we’re in a climate of real social tension today, which goes beyond pensions. Our study in Libération found almost unanimity – 89 per cent – of French people thinking we’re living through a social crisis, but also 64 per cent said they felt Macron didn’t understand those social difficulties . . That mood of social crisis will hang over this strike action.” –Reuters and "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

It was actually revised up a bit, to 49.3 from a flash estimate of 48.6, which is better than a kick in the teeth.\u0026nbspIt stood at 50 (flat) last month. New business, meanwhile, contracted for the third month in a row, and at the fastest rate since July 2016.\u0026nbspGiven the sector’s dominance, all this bodes ill for the UK economy.\u0026nbspIt hasn’t played much of a role during the General Election but if it carries on like it this\u0026nbspit’ll be getting a lot more attention in the aftermath.\u0026nbspPolitics is behind both the gloomy picture painted of how its biggest component is performing\u0026nbspby the PMI. It’s also behind the pound’s rise from its unhealthy position on the ropes. \u0026nbspCurrency traders think it’s in the bag for Boris Johnson, that he’ll get his dismal “deal” through and that the risks of chaos will be diminished as a result. Not being overly fond of Jeremy Corbyn, they’re also quite pleased to see Labour’s poll ratings becalmed.\u0026nbspThey may be missing the bigger picture given the fraught negotiations on trade that will follow and play a big role in sentiment moving forward. How often does that need repeating? Quite a lot, it seems.\u0026nbspThe UK will simply swapping one form of uncertainty for another if Johnson wins a majority. That helps to explain why the services sector remains so weak and may continue to be weak until there is something resembling clarity on the UK’s relationship with its biggest trading partner.\u0026nbspOne of the many tragedies of Brexit is how little attention\u0026nbspservices were given during the negotiations and how little thought has been directed towards\u0026nbspthe impact Brexit will have on this crucial sector moving forward. A pick up could be some time in coming.Consumer spending, and more government money sloshing around courtesy of higher government spending, may ultimately serve keep the official GDP number from looking too bad. They’ve rescued it in the face of gloomy PMIs, which also cover the (currently no less gloomy) construction and manufacturing sectors, in the past.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The country as a whole would be the net beneficiary of that even if it gives traders fits.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A 7 grade is roughly equivalent to an A under the old system and a 4 is the same as an old C grade.Researchers for the Sutton Trust, who compared GCSE data before and after the new exams were taken, found that attainment gaps increased across a range of subjects,\u0026nbspincluding the sciences. \u0026nbspThe report found little difference in the attainment gap at the headline measure – the number of students getting at least a grade 4 – but it warned that a focus on top grades from employers and universities\u0026nbspcould negatively affect disadvantaged pupils.Before the 2015 changes took place, 2 per cent of disadvantaged students achieved the top grade of A*, whereas under the new system just 1 per cent\u0026nbspreceived a top mark of 9, the report says.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailTougher GCSEs have negative effect on lower-ability pupils, heads sayThe drop was less marked for non-disadvantaged students, among whom 8 per cent achieved an A* compared with 5 per cent getting a 9.The data indicates non-disadvantaged students were 3.37 times more likely to achieve grade 9 than disadvantaged pupils and 1.63 times more likely to get grade 5 or higher after the changes.James Turner, CEO of the Sutton Trust, said: “While the motivation behind the 2015 reforms was to drive up standards, there were concerns that the changes could come at the expense of the poorest pupils. \u0026nbsp“Our research tells us that the changes have likely had a small impact on the attainment gap, with disadvantaged pupils losing out by about a quarter of a grade across 9 subjects.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the widening of the attainment gap since the introduction of the new GCSEs was “a terrible indictment” of the changes.\u0026nbspMore lenient grading for languages GCSEs after pupils find them hardColleges struggling to cope with growing number of teens out of schoolFewer than one in three heads think GCSEs prepare pupils for workHe said: “The issue that we really need to address is how to better serve students who face the greatest level of challenge. The new GCSE system does the exact opposite by making their lives even more difficult.”Mr Barton added: “The reality is that the students who struggle the most –\u0026nbspmany of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds – have a very poor experience of the new GCSEs and leave school feeling demoralised about their prospects for onward progression to courses and careers.”James Bowen, director of policy at school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “Simply making exams tougher does nothing to raise standards and improve outcomes.

numbers.Just last week, new figures revealed that the government had failed to hit targets for recruiting secondary teachers for the seventh consecutive year at a time when pupil numbers are rising.\u0026nbspPaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “We need significantly more recruits than Labour are suggesting just to meet rising demand, never mind reduce current class sizes.“The new recruits we need will not magically appear, and nor will they stay if we don’t also address the stress and unnecessary workload that is widespread in the system.”Announcing the party’s plans on Thursday,\u0026nbspAngela Rayner, shadow education secretary, said: “Labour will transform education standards in this country for every child, capping class sizes and ensuring every child is taught by a qualified teacher in a safe school building.‘Alarming’: Teacher training targets missed for seventh year in a row“We will invest in record per-pupil funding, restore the pupil premium and close the gap in support for children with special educational needs and disabilities, to give every child the support they need.”Only the best news in your

We\u0027re a country with 150 billionaires, and we\u0027ve still got people sleeping on the streets\u0027Jeremy Corbyn says he will give up the luxury rural retreat of Chequers if he wins the general election, in a protest against rising homelessness.“It can\u0027t be right. We\u0027re a country with 150 billionaires, and we\u0027ve still got people sleeping on the streets,” the Labour leader said, when quizzed on whether he would use the grace-and-favour mansion.But Mr Corbyn got into a tangle after saying he “usually” watches the Queen’s Christmas Day\u0026nbspmessage – then mistakenly claiming it is shown in the morning.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDuring the interview on ITV, he also declined to set out the most romantic thing he has done, saying: “Wow, that\u0027s a hard one. Nobody ever thinks of me as romantic.”And, asked for “the most romantic sort of wild and reckless thing you’ve ever done”, Mr Corbyn replied: “You can\u0027t ask that question on television.”John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has already said he would give up Dorneywood, the country pile offered to chancellors of the exchequer and open it to the public instead.On ITV, Mr Corbyn was asked: “Would you consider giving up Chequers if you were prime minister?”, replying: “I would indeed.”He was also asked: “Do you sit down to watch the Queen\u0027s Speech?”, telling the interviewer, Julie Etchingham: “It\u0027s on the morning, usually we have it on – some of the time.”She replied: “It’s not on in the morning, it’s at three o’clock in the afternoon,” prompting Mr Corbyn to say: “It’s when its repeated, in the afternoon.”Created with Sketch.

Of course, that includes President Trump, yes.”Asked how he would form a good relationship with Mr Trump, the Labour leader said he would “work out issues that we agree on”He would then “try and persuade him on both trade issues and particularly on climate change and the importance of the Paris Climate Change\u0026nbspAccord”.“I hope we can go further than Paris because we cannot go on allowing global warming to carry on at this rate.

But, writes Ashley Cowburn, now it’s at a crossroadsA parasitic organisation, a bit of rabble, proof of a Trotskyist infiltration, a theatrical cult. These were just a handful of the phrases used to describe Momentum, the group of activists on the left of the Labour Party, in its early days. They would have likely been far worse had one of the other names put forward been chosen: swarm.“Look, when you ask people to come up with ideas for names, what they do is they can think of two or three good ones, or reasonable ones, and then try to make up the numbers,” says founder Jon Lansman. “I think Swarm wasn’t even on the bottom rung. That got the biggest laugh.”The grassroots organisation was set up by Lansman, alongside Adam Klug, Emma Rees and James Schneider, in the wake of Jeremy Corbyn’s 2015 leadership success. They had all worked on the Labour leader’s surprise victory, and sought to harness the energy behind that campaign to build a social movement supporting Corbyn’s left-wing policy agenda – drawing inspiration from anti-austerity movements in Europe, including Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFour years later, sitting in Momentum’s Finsbury Park office, serving as an election headquarters close to the Labour leader’s constituency office, Lansman, who is wearing an orange tie-dye Grateful Dead T-shirt, reflects on the name they eventually chose. “It’s very difficult when you’re trying to think of a name\u0026nbsppeople associate the word with what they think the words means, rather than what they think it will become once you create a big organisation which has a big effect. And then the word acquires a completely new meaning which is how people see what Momentum became. Obviously it reflected the momentum that increased during the course of the leadership campaign.”What Momentum became is a group boasting 40,000 members paying a minimum of £3 per month that has put itself at the forefront of Labour’s push to win next week’s general election, raising £500,000 in donations to be used on canvassing by its army of activists and innovative digital campaigning. But that is a far cry from where it all began.\u0026nbspAs Corbyn’s popularity grew in the 2015 leadership contest, those intimately involved in the campaign decided a separate organisation was required to ensure the energy from the tens of thousands of members who joined Labour did not dissipate. Lansman, who had cut his teeth 34 years earlier in Tony Benn’s deputy leadership campaign, crucially\u0026nbsphad also kept the email list of Corbyn supporters.Welcoming its eventual launch, Corbyn said at the time: “We need to put our values, the people’s values, back into politics. To do this, we need to keep up the momentum we have built over the last four months.”\u0026nbspBut today, Lansman admits Momentum launched “before we were ready”, adding: “We didn’t have a constitution, we’d had all these groups spring up around the country organically, we didn’t organise them.\u0026nbspWe didn’t have the rules, we tried to impose – because we launched without a constitution – we tried to impose some rules on them.”“It was a turbulent time,” Lansman adds. “We had people who weren’t members of the party, people who perhaps had paid £3 to vote, but had decided not to join the party. It was a difficult time to establish an organisation, but we did and we have established a new, left organisation, with a culture that is very different from any left organisation.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMomentum faced considerable conflict with the party’s MPs at Westminster over the highly contentious issue of deselections. Those opposed to the party’s new leadership viewed the organisation as a threatening force, seeking to purge critics of Corbyn from the Labour Party, while activists pointed to increasing internal democracy and enfranchising party members.\u0026nbspThe threshold for MPs to be “triggered” was reduced at last year’s Labour conference, and Lansman says there is still “further to go” in handing party members more powers – pointing to the group’s failure, so far, to introduce “open selections”.\u0026nbspThere’s a tendency with journalists to demonise Momentum. I’ve met Momentum members of all shapes and sizes“It would have been much better to have open selections where people make positive choices for the candidate they thought would best represent them, rather than having to make negative choices about not wanting a particular person, which I think is more isive,” he adds.\u0026nbspCritics included former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, who famously denounced the Trotskyist group Militant at the 1985 party conference. Ahead of the first The World Transformed in 2016 – a festival at Labour conference by Momentum activists – he said the “sectarian ultra-left” speaking at the organisation’s events risked endangering the party as a political force.\u0026nbspHis concern, he added, was that decent and enthusiastic young people were being “manipulated” by “people from the hard left organising in a less-than-transparent way to secure their aged-old objective, the control of the Labour Party”.But, speaking in the dining room of her home in Hackney, east London, Diane Abbott dismisses the criticism of the organisation. “If Neil Kinnock knows more than a dozen Momentum members, I’d be surprised,” the shadow home secretary says. “What he is doing is confusing them with Militant, but they are a different thing.\u0026nbsp“The point about Momentum is that it was people who were either in the party or, crucially, joined the party to support Jeremy Corbyn – that’s who they are. There’s a tendency with journalists to demonise Momentum. I’ve met Momentum members of all shapes and sizes, some of them have never been in the party, some of them are very young, some of them are a bit closer to me in age.”But Lansman acknowledges there have been periods of ision, including the “difference of view on antisemitism” allegations. Shortly after Momentum’s inaugural gathering at the Labour Party conference in 2016, Jackie Walker, who was then the organisation’s vice chair, was stripped of\u0026nbspher position after considerable criticism of her remarks about Holocaust Memorial Day. “In terms of Holocaust day, wouldn’t it be wonderful if Holocaust day was open to all people who experienced Holocaust?” she told a fringe event. Walker was expelled from Labour earlier this year and has made a film, called Witch Hunt, about her experiences.After Corbyn defeated an attempt to oust him as leader in 2016, the organisation was no longer just a Praetorian guard for the Labour leader during periods of instability. Sweeping changes to the organisation were rapidly executed in early 2017, and Momentum announced it would affiliate to the Labour Party itself. It meant its grassroots supporters were required to be, or become members of, the national party. Those who were expelled from Labour could no longer operate within the organisation.It then turned its firepower to mobilising activists in marginal seats across the country, using\u0026nbspinnovative forms of digital campaigning. A developed version of its 2017 snap election app “My Nearest Marginal”, pioneered\u0026nbspby Bernie Sanders’ team during the US democratic primaries, which directed activists to areas where canvassing was required, has been created for the December election.\u0026nbspMomentum’s tactics also won plaudits from unlikely quarters in the aftermath of Theresa May’s failed gamble to win a greater Conservative majority. Giles Kenningham, a former director of communications for the party, commented: “Labour have used Momentum to devastating effect. The Tories do not have an equivalent group pushing out their message”.\u0026nbspIt is still the situation today that the Conservatives have no equivalent. Within days of MPs agreeing to fight a general election, Momentum dwarfed the funds it raised at the last poll. Staffing at Momentum has been increased from 15 to 55 full-time members, funded by almost half a million pounds of donations, and over 1,400 volunteers have pledged to take an average of two weeks out of work to campaign for a Labour government.\u0026nbspThe digital side is coordinated\u0026nbspfrom the north London office space where activists have a paper countdown of “days until socialism” plastered to the wall. The upgraded app – “My Campaign Map” – has had over 1.4 million views and gives advice to Labour campaigners on where they can make the biggest impact. In the week after MPs voted for an early election, the organisation coordinated “Super Saturday” through the app with thousands of activists hitting the streets.One activist, 32-year-old Jessica Adams, a cultural studies student and Momentum member, claims the app had been “really, really helpful” and she had visited constituencies\u0026nbspacross the UK, including Chingford and Woodford Green, Kensington, Battersea and Aberconwy. Adams says “My Campaign Map” has been “really effective”, adding that hundreds turned out in Chingford, where the Labour candidate Faiza Shaheen is attempting to unseat the senior Conservative Iain Duncan Smith and wipe out his slim 2017 majority of just over 2,400.The journalist and Labour activist\u0026nbspOwen Jones, who has spent time across the country during the election campaign, says Momentum has played a “pivotal role in mobilising activists” and has helped get activists knocking on doors in both defensive and offensive constituencies. “Momentum played a huge role in just getting people to knock on doors, listen to people and get the critical information needed to pinpoint who the undecided voters are.”Lansman: ‘We are the new mainstream’In his Westminster office – the day after the Labour leadership signed up to a winter election – John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and close ally of Corbyn, describes Momentum as “one of the most successful things that’s happened” to the party. “It’s been a real asset to us all the way through – more than Jeremy, it’s an asset for the Labour Party”.McDonnell adds: “It’s just a huge activist organisation, in terms of enthusiastic members – most of them young people. What’s interesting, they are very professional about how they operate, they are young people who come up with really creative ideas about how to mobilise, how to engage with people, and their social media presence is so effective. They have these training sessions with people about how to engage in conversation on the doorstep, how to use the right language, how to ensure you actually listen.”For Momentum, the big question is: what happens next? After finding relevance fighting for Corbyn in two leadership battles, and now, two general elections, the group is keeping one eye on its next step. A major shift came earlier this year, and had a rippling effect at Labour’s annual conference on the Brighton seafront. Momentum began lobbying for policies that went beyond Corbyn’s existing blueprint for a socialist Britain, including a four-day working week, the abolition of immigration detention centres, and a green new deal focused on achieving zero carbon by 2030. “Radical and transformative policy can’t only come from the halls of Westminster,” a spokesperson declared at the time. “It must come from Labour’s half a million members.”\u0026nbspAttempting to reinvigorate activists demoralised by Labour’s triangulation on Brexit, for the first time the group found itself publicly demanding a more radical programme for government than the one on offer. After all, one of its founding values was to support Corbyn’s left-wing policy agenda, not just the leader himself. It could also be viewed as the organisation re-establishing itself for one of two scenarios: a post-Corbyn Labour Party, or a Corbyn government.\u0026nbspFor the latter, it is how to remain relevant having played a major role in installing one of the most left-wing administrations in Downing Street in British political history. It is clear there is no intention of winding down when this ultimate goal has been achieved. Instead, it will be about ensuring there is “demonstrable public support” for key elements in Labour’s “boldest and most ambitious programme since 1945”, such as the green new deal that Lansman believes will come under attack in parliament from the Conservatives and opposition parties. “I don’t have any doubt that Jeremy and John McDonnell are committed to that programme,” he says. “I think that doesn’t mean to say no pressure is required to ensure that the Labour Party as a whole sticks with its guns.”Jones believes that if Labour forms a government after the snap election, “all hell would break lose from an establishment which is not very happy at all with that form of government”.\u0026nbspHe adds that Momentum’s role in this scenario would be to continue mobilising in communities, but also putting pressure on a Labour administration.\u0026nbspHe says: “It shouldn’t just be an auxiliary wing of the Labour leadership. Already you’ve seen Momentum put pressure on the Labour leadership to shifting position on anything from the rights of migrants, which the Labour leadership have been quite depressing on since the referendum, and other issues like being more radical on the climate emergency.“In government, Momentum should put pressure on the Labour leadership if it wasn’t to fulfil radical promises – it’s not there to be a Corbyn fanclub, it’s there to fight for socialist policies.”But as Laura Parker, a former private secretary to the Labour leader and now national coordinator at Momentum, said at the beginning of the campaign: the party has a “mountain to climb” to achieve victory and deprive Johnson of a majority Conservative government. Lansman points to Labour’s recent improvement in the polls – a BMG survey for The Independent showed the party had cut the Conservative lead to just six points at the weekend. He believes a “great number of seats” are within target if Labour’s position improves, but on the prospect of a majority Labour government he admits: “That is obviously a lower chance than us being in some kind of minority government, but I think there’s an excellent chance of that and that is absolutely what we’re working for. That’s why we’re targeting offensively, because we want to win, and we think we can win.”For the former scenario, however, it is how Momentum reasserts itself if Corbyn is defeated at the first December general election for almost a century. According to last week’s polling model by YouGov, which accurately predicted the outcome of the 2017 election, Labour is on course for its worst election result since 1983 when Michael Foot was at the helm of the party. If it is proved correct a second time, Corbyn would be under immense pressure to resign.\u0026nbspMomentum will probably play a key role in the resulting leadership contest, and if it decides to throw its powerful caucus behind a left-wing candidate, that inidual will have a considerable chance of victory. But for now, at least, Lansman is unwilling to entertain life after Corbyn. “We’re focused on winning, we’re not focused on losing, or losing badly,” he says. “I think Jeremy should step down when he wants to step down. I think that is matter to be considered – these are matters to be considered when we, after the election. I don’t expect there actually be a very rapid decision. There will only be one week before Christmas at that point. I’m expecting him to be putting a cabinet together in that week.”But one thing is clear: there will be no closing down of operations at Momentum should Labour lose the election and Corbyn decide it is time to step aside. “The wilderness years are over whatever the outcome of this election,” Lansman adds. It’s a reference to his own return from political irrelevance and the left’s position on the fringes of the Labour movement. “The Labour Party has shifted big time. Actually British politics has shifted against austerity big time. That was achieved actually as soon as Jeremy won. Theresa May was already trying to park her tanks on our lawn, claiming that austerity was over,” he says. “I’m not going back to the wilderness, no, absolutely. I and Momentum are here for the long run.“We are here for the long run, and we will deal with whatever the result of the election is.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Big bars, too. Very hard to miss.And while the club wasn’t running hot enough that we were all rushing outside every few minutes gasping for air, the dance floor, full with bodies by am was humid enough that most were sweating. Prince Andrew claimed he couldn’t have been in Tramp the night Virginia Roberts detailed because he’d been in Pizza Express with his daughters at pm. They must have been eating a lot of Margheritas because things at Tramp didnt get started until midnight.From the off, Tramp did not feel like the “home away from home” that it was advertised as. Or not any home that I’ve ever been to at any rate.For starters, it was carpeted, a luxury not normally entrusted to those of us who like to pay a pound for our Jaeger-bombs.I suppose though when you’re spending £ on a GT, you can be trusted not to waste a drop to spillage.Nostalgia runs through the clubs very foundations. The smoking roomis plastered with quotes from celebrities about their time there.“Tramp was the place where we all took girls, because they wanted to go there” read one, from Terry O’Neil.And looking around it would seem that that was very much still the case. There were lots of girls there on Friday night.Had I been a little bit more naive, and had a group of glamorous girls at the table next to us not told me how much they’d charge men to take them home , I might’ve bought into the idea that Tramp was still as it once was an exclusive and exciting place for groupies to congregate, hopeful that their favourite celebrity might buy them a drink I might also have believed Daniel, the “businessman” who split his time between the United Arab Emirates and the UK when he told me that what happened in Tramp was all “harmless fun.”There’s no denying that Tramp is a great night out. It is the place that saw Keith Moon literally swing from the chandeliers , where Tara Palmer-Tomkinson partied the night away in a bikini for her birthday in the s. It reeks of history and of charm there’s something about the building that gives you a wink and an arse slap as you walk in. Rather tellingly, after the Prince Andrew interview aired, a quote was found on the club’s website from Rod Stewart: “just as well it was before camera phones. We’d all be in prison by now, the things we got up to in Tramp.”Quite.Sun Online contacted Tramp for comment but had no reply.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some will face genuine hardship because of the loss of earnings.RMT members say theyre striking for passenger safety, but this is just a smokescreenThose who try to use the skeleton service face massive overcrowding, congested s and packed carriages.One woman even fainted yesterday on the . line from Woking to Waterloo yesterday morning because of over-crowding.The current strike is part of a long-running dispute on the railways over union objections to the introduction of driver-only operated trains.Since , there have been regular walkouts, such as the three days of strike action on South Western in January last year, which saw the cancellation of  trains.This time, the RMT claims that it is acting “in defence of passenger safety” over changes in the guards’ job descriptions and the removal of their responsibilities of operating the train doors.But this is just a smokescreen. The genuine, more sinister, motivations for the strike are twofold: first to defend their members’ present conditions, no matter how outdated, inefficient or inappropriate second, to promote Labour’s agenda of nationalisation by discrediting the private operators.It is no coincidence that the RMT’s biggest ever strike began during the final full week of campaigning in the General Election.No sector in the British economy would welcome a Jeremy Corbyn government more the trade unions, which are desperate to win back the influence they held in the s.In turn, Labour is seeking to win over disillusioned rail passengers by promising massive cuts in ticket prices.Just as the RMT strike began today, Corbyn’s party announced that it would reduce regulated fares by  per cent, a move cynically targeted at commuters.The unions barons have a stranglehold on Labour, not least because they effectively bankroll the party. It is no exaggeration to say that Labour is the political wing of the union movement.Out of the total donations of £ million to Labour in , the unions gave £. million.The biggest sum, £ million, came from UNITE, led by Corbyn ally “Red Len” McCluskey, the hard-left Merseysider who once boasted that he had led more strikes than any other union boss in Britain.Last week, it was revealed that UNITE has just handed over a further £ million to Labour’s General Election fund.A further £, came from the Communication Workers Union, which has been threatening disruption in the Royal Mail in the run-up to Christmas.That spirit of confrontation would dramatically worsen under Corbyn.If he became PM, he would make it much easier for the unions to hold strikes.His Government would repeal most of the vital reforms introduced by Margaret Thatcher, such as restraints on picketing, democratic rules on ballots and bans on sympathy walkouts.Corbyn’s manesto states that his party plans “to remove unnecessary restrictions on industrial action”, as part of a drive “to create new rights and freedoms for trade unions.”That is a recipe for permanent industrial crisis and economic meltdown.A Corbyn-led Government will turn the clock back to the s, when the bullying union barons brought the country to a standstill.Last year, just , working days were lost to strike action. In , the total was  million and in , during the Winter of Discontent, a colossal . million working days were lost.For most of the British people, that period was a nightmare. But for Corbyn, McDonnell and their allies in the trade unions, it was a time of glorious advance.Their party and supporters are the very last people who would stand up to the trade unions. On the contrary, they will be cheering on the militants, justying all their industrial vandalism and bullying.And, as the climate of appeasement spreads, the dominance of the unions will tighten.The RMT will be at the forefront of the chaos, not least because its General Secretary Mick Cash – who is on a fat cat package of £,-a-year – shares Corbyn’s hard left outlook.Cash recently praised the Labour leader for “the socialist advances that have been made in the party.”This month’s RMT strike gives a disturbing glimpse into dark future that awaits Britain under Corbyn.Behind all its empty rhetoric about concern for the public, the union’s justication for imposing gridlock is as baseless as it is cruel.Contrary to the RMT’s scare-mongering, driver-only operated trains are safer and have a lower record of assaults. That reality was reinforced by a study in  by the Independent Rail Safety and Standards Board, which gave them a clean bill of health.Moreover, the union cannot pretend that rail staff are badly treated.Most of them enjoy far better conditions, holidays, job security, and pensions than their counterparts outside the public services. Like Corbyn’s Labour, the RMT has lost the plot. For the sake of our country, Mick Cash and his fellow unions barons should not be allowed any more power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His charred body parts would be passed around for everyone to taste.His blood, which they saved, would be smeared over their bodies. Once the head was fully cooked, they would scalp it, remove his brain and eat it.Everything not eaten would be saved. Some would be used in weapons, others as religious icons.But during that time The Dutch, who had taken over the archipelago from the United East India Company in , had been showing interest in the colony.Max Lapre, known for his strict leadership of the Dutch government ordered five elite Asmats to be gunned down - devastating and angering the tribe who believed in an eye for an eye.The brutal deaths of the five men left a festering wound in the village and every day the Asmats wanted to seek vengeance on the white man.This was when Michael swam to shore on November  .According to the documentation of the Asmat headhunting ritual, they would first remove Michael’s head, then slit him from the neck down his back. Entrails would be removed.Legs and arms would go into the fire while the group chanted. His charred body parts would be passed around for everyone to taste.His blood, which they saved, would be smeared over their bodies.

Some would be used in weapons, others as religious icons.If theyd killed Michael that was how it would have been done, Hoffman says.The Asmat people have spent centuries hunting down their enemies and removing their heads, sometimes transforming their decapitated skulls into pillows and other times using them as macabre bowls to eat the flesh of their opposing tribes.Asmat did not only hunt for skulls, they also worshipped them.The headhunting practice stopped in the s.The skulls of the deceased were stripped of the brain and the eyes and nasal parts were closed up in order to prevent evil spirits to enter or exit the body.Within the tribe there are no sexual barriers, men had sex with men, they shared wives and practised polygamy. They sometimes drank each other’s urine and covered themselves in human blood during bonding rituals.They believe that when they killed a man and ate him, they take his power and become him. Every person was named after someone deceased, or after a killed enemy.So them killing Michael would be their way of making up for the deaths of their tribe members at the hands of the white Dutch.Another of Hoffmans reasons for believing that Rockefeller was eaten by the tribe was had he drowned he would have been found by search parties as he had two gasoline tanks tied to him, which were never found.He also argues that sharks rarely attack humans, and there has never been a shark attack death in Asmat.Upon his disappearance the Rockefeller family flew to New Guinea and searched for over a week.The President John F. Kennedy sent condolences and offered the family support.But on the ninth day, the family flew home and the Dutch called off the search and ruled his death as drowning."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn labour leader new statesman","story":"The left-wing publication today published an election editorial in which it refused to support Mr Corbyns bid for power ahead of the general election in eight days.The magazine has been a required reading for the Labour Party for decades.In a bombshell issue, it said the Labour leaders reluctance to apologise for his handling of the partys anti-Semitism crisis meant he should not be put into Downing Streets Number .The publication also condemned his approach to Brexit ahead of the General Election on December .According to a poll by YouGov for The Times last week, the Labour leader was set to lose the election with only  seats but a series of surveys over the weekend predicted a Labour was putting a squeeze on Boris Johnsons lead.A poll by BMG Research for the Independent on Saturday had Mr Corbyn jumping ahead by  points to  per cent, leaving only six points of wiggle room between the two parties.The New Statesman said that both Mr Corbyn and Boris Johnson are profoundly unpopular and their moral integrity has been compromised by events in their past.The magazine also added that many voters despair at the choice before them.It also included: But the essential judgement that must be made is on Mr Corbyn himself.His reluctance to apologise for the anti-Semitism in Labour and to take a stance on Brexit, the biggest issue facing the country, make him unfit to be prime minister.The publication also refused to endorse the Liberal Democrats, accusing the party of showing little intellectual ambition.It said: Yet for the reasons outlined, we have resolved to endorse no party at this general election.It comes as Corbyn’s massive renationalisation plans would risk “years of disruption”, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.The think tank warned the impact of the massive buyouts would not only leave Britain with debts of £ billion but Labour has not provided a plan to manage the new networks.Under current proposed Labour plans the IFS say that five per cent of private companies will be nationalised, swelling the public sector workforce by ,.Labour’s  general election manesto pledged to “bring rail, mail, water and energy” alongside “the broadband-relevant parts of BT” under government ownership.But the IFS warned purchasing them will be tricky as valuing the companies – some of which are in foreign ownership – risks damaging the UK’s reputation."},{"url":null,"title":"life long vegetarian mcdonalds chicken veggie wrap","story":"Fuming Evie Topping, , ordered the wrap from fast food joint in Exchange Walk, Nottingham city centre, around pm on Friday.The snack was supposed to consist of a veggie goujon, shredded lettuce and tomato ketchup, wrapped up in a toasted tortilla.But she and pal Simone, , were stunned to discover pieces of chicken inside the wrap instead.She tweeted a video of the wrap, saying it had ruined her and Simones -plus years of being vegetarian.In response, McDonalds has apologised and said it will send her some vouchers as soon as possible.The company said staff would make every effort to make sure that such problems do not happen again.It added: Many apologies for your upset and distress.To help make up for your experience and to say sorry that it didnt meet your expectations, we would like to send you some vouchers towards a meal which you can use at any of our UK restaurants.However Evie, a masters student at Nottingham Trent University, told Nottinghamshire Live that it was pretty bad that they had just offered her vouchers.She has also asked for the value of her original meal to be refunded.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Experts believe the metals come from the heating coils found in vaping devices.The European Respiratory Society, which published the case study, has now issued a new warning against vaping.The society said: “The human lungs are created to breathe clean air.”University of Manchester’s Prof Jørgen Vestbo, who co-wrote the editorial, said: “E-cigarettes are harmful. The medical profession and public should be concerned about a new wave of lung diseases.”Prof Kirk Jones said: “This patient did not have any known exposure to hard metal, so we identied the use of an e-cigarette as a possible cause.“We believe it is likely not just that this will happen again but that it has happened already but not been recognised.”Researchers found the toxic metals cobalt, nickel, aluminium, manganese, lead and chromium in the vapour released by the patient’s e-cig.They have previously been found in vapour from other e-cigarettes.

Clearly it takes courage to stand before an audience charged with being funny enough to quieten the clink of cutlery.But let’s be frank. He is simply another BBC comedian with acceptable views.BBC-approved comedians dominate the maintained sector of British comedy.Auntie is the superpower of sponsored satire, scattering municence in the direction of any up-and-coming talent with a neat line in attacking approved targets: The patriarchy, Brexit, Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Tories, country-sports enthusiasts, royalists and Priti Patel. You get the picture.Of course, not all comedians rely on such sketches. But those that don’t often pay the price.Take talented young comedian Alistair Williams, who shot to prominence off the back of a sketch in which he likened Brexit to being stuck in a Burger King you have voted to leave. His video soon went viral.But as he noted on Twitter the next day: “Because I am a comedian that supports Brexit, you can no longer find me on the comedy club circuit.”There are exceptions. Pro-Brexit comedian Geoff Norcott is gradually finding his way on to a few BBC shows.Simon Evans is a successful comic who parodies his own upper-middle class, right-of-centre viewpoint, while occasionally getting in an anti-leftist dig along the way.But compare that to the roll call of liberal-left comics who pop up on the BBC: Ed Byrne, Dara O Briain, Marcus Brigstocke, Jolyon Rubinstein, Sandi Toksvig, Mitchell and Webb, Mark Steel, Mark Thomas, Jo Brand, Andy Parsons, Russell Howard and Stewart Lee.These and others form a rolling castlist for the BBC’s many radio and TV  and sketch shows, trotting out the same takes to approving titters from audiences apparently bussed in en-masse from North London.A few weeks ago, after enduring a standard Have I Got News For You anti-Brexit fest, I turned over to watch Mock The Week on BBC to see host Dara O Briain tell a list of Malaysian heritage he wouldn’t be welcome in the Brexit Party .I vented about it on Twitter because whatever you think of the Brexit Party, it has been notably erse since its inception. O Briain’s lazy smear made no sense.It quickly transpired the one Malaysian-born person to achieve senior elected office in the UK is Christina Jordan, who is the Brexit Party’s MEP for Gibraltar and the South West.Soon she was giving O Briain an ear-bashing.His retort was that he got a laugh from the studio audience because that was what they thought of the Brexit Party.No wonder, eh Even some of those on the BBC’s roster have clocked that their unormity of outlook might be a problem.Brigstocke spoke in  of the shock of seeing audience members walk out of his show during his anti-Brexit segment when he took it on tour round the country.But comedy as a whole shows few signs of coming to terms with the case for more erse thinking.Most of us not on the Left do not close our minds to the possibility of those we disagree with still being funny.The late Jeremy Hardy’s Tory takedowns on Radio ’s The News Quiz were brilliant.But most comics don’t work hard enough to offer such original material.Jo Brand’s joke about battery acid being thrown over politicians is a case in point.We get she probably doesn’t really wish that on anyone. It is another way for her to say she doesn’t like particular politicians.We knew that.Thankfully, salvation is at hand.An independent sector is sprouting up, taking advantage of social media and hosting free-thinking comedy nights.Lee Hurst, a veteran whose broadcast career was curtailed for not being reliably left-wing, is a patron of the scene.In performers such as Williams, Norcott, Evans and Titania McGrath satirist Andrew Doyle — plus free-wheeling left-wingers such as Francesca Martinez and American Rob Delaney — we see the makings of a new alternative-comedy scene.Seek them out, ditch the BBC and have a laugh.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And independent charity Full Fact said: “Labour’s figures do not reflect an average family or the costs of price inflation over time.”Treasury Minister Rishi Sunak added: “It defies belief that Corbyn’s Labour are claiming they would reduce living costs at the same time as standing on a manesto containing tax rises which would hit ordinary hardworking people across the country.”Labour claim Brits have had to fork out an extra £ since  on dual-fuel energy bills, while they can save them £. But the small print admits most of this cash, £, comes from making homes more energy ­efficient and Labour say that programme will not be finished until .On water, Labour say the Tories have cost families £ a year and they will save them £. But critics say their plan to renationalise water will end in higher prices.Corbyn  Co also say the average home has forked out an extra £ over the last decade for broadband and vow to save them £ by making it free. But the bills only rose by £ and the proposed saving — again — will only come in .Labour’s plans to slash rail ticket prices to save homes £, were also mocked as just ten per cent of Brits commute to work, meaning most won’t see a penny of the cash.And its childcare claims fail to include the £billion a year the Government pays out.Mr McDonnell insisted the figures were “objectively assessed”.But Tory vice chairman Paul Scully said: “It’s clear Corbyn just can’t be straight with people.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Askedthere was evidence that the Labour leaderaposs office was interfering in the investigations process, Mr Libson said: There has been interference and that interference has unfortunately become institutional.

The last December election in the UK was held in  and hearing political debates in the midst of John Lewis ads jars slightly like, don’t they know it’s Christmas  I would so much rather be knee-deep in crackers, Secret Santa and turkey stuffing rather than thinking about the election and I don’t even celebrate Christmas that much. Given the dreary weather I have more chance of catching a cold than I have of contracting election fever. I wasn’t always so apathetic. As a bright-eyed, bushy-eyebrowed child I invented my own political party called The Preservatives- But We’re Not Articial- which espoused traditional British values like handing your homework in on time and not dropping litter. I would watch party political broadcasts for fun and remember being blown away by Neil Kinnock’s legendary speech at the Labour conference back in . But then le takes over. You get older and realise that whoever gets in things it all just gets harder. I don’t just feel squeezed, I feel like I’m constantly being punched in the face. I live in the Labour stronghold of Bradford West. Maverick George Galloway briefly became our MP for the Respect Party but he didn’t last long and the seat swung back- hard- to Labour.  The community has largely always been pro-Labour but there has also been a move towards the Tories among those who see themselves as upwardly mobile and conservative with a small ‘c’. People say the Referendum unleashed a tidal wave of racism I have witnessed a man in the supermarket look at a family of Asians and say: “At least after Brexit we won’t see so many of them.” But Brexit itself is not that straightforward for us here. I have been told to go back home in broken English by a man newly arrived from Eastern European. Considering I was born and raised here that really is ironic. The city also voted Leave. So how do I feel about the two leaders  With Corbyn I know he has principles. He cares about the poor, the disadvantaged, the destitute.

Over the past decade we have seen severe cuts to youth services, the closure of over  youth centres and an embarrassing failure to act on the climate emergency. This blatant disregard for the future of our generation has led to young people feeling severely let down.As one student told me in Southampton the joy of being young is that a world of opportunity awaits, but for this generation, it feels asthose opportunities are closing in on us by the day. The main concern for myself and youth organisations across the country is whether or not we decide to do anything about it.The silver-lining to the Government neglecting us is that it has now inspired one of the most powerful forces in political history - the youth movement. Analysts, pollsters and political figures are waiting in anticipation to see whether the rhetoric will be backed up by action. Will young people capitalize on the most powerful form of democratic accountability  As the Founder and CEO of YouthPolitics UK, I have spoken to thousands of young adults in universities and sixth forms across the country. It appears the question is notthey are motivated to turnout and vote - they are. In fact, they have registered to vote in their masses. The question really is, do they have anyone to vote for  It is no secret that the vast majority of young people want to remain in the European Union and embrace a world in which we celebrate ersity and tolerance. Yet the lack of a credible option for young people to vote for encapsulates the sad state of our politics. Memories of the Liberal Democrats failing our generation on the issue of tuition fees remain stark in our minds. Divisions within the Labour Party and its failure to tackle anti-Semitism contradict the very values that we as a generation stand for. Indeed, the leader of the Conservative Party couldn’t even be bothered to stand up and debate climate change, the greatest issue facing our generation, with the other party leaders. There is something that all political leaders should understand in the run up to this election. Young people will decide who enters Number  on December th, so listen to us.

The woman, named only as Rachel, tearfully told of her struggle to make sure her son is fed and has a roof over his head as she put down four p pieces and six pence coins. She was featured in a special general election report as BBC News visited Grimsby to to speak to voters who are relying on foodbanks. Rachel hit out at politicians, saying they donapost understand what itaposs like to go without basic necessities or to struggle as a single parent. Are you a struggling parent  Email your story to webnews@mirror. The single mum invited the news crew into the temporary accommodation she shares with her teenage son, Bradley, after a visit to the Rock Foundation foodbank, GrimsbyLive reports. She emptied her pockets to show how much money she had. She told the BBC through tears: “That’s all our money”. Asked what her biggest concerns are, Rachel said: “Making sure my son is fed and has a roof over his head for the time being.  “If I didn’t have him I wouldn’t be here. I know I wouldn’t. It’s because of him I’m still here.” The programme touched on votersapos distrust of politicians. Rachel said: “Sometimes I think they don’t deserve it [my vote] because they don’t get, they don’t understand, what it’s like to be without.” On the topic of Brexit, which has dominated the campaign, she said: “The situation I’m in, it can’t get any worse.”  The programme featured a number of locals who rely on community shops and foodbanks. Many told how they had no faith in the political class. Pam Hodge, of the Rock Foundation, told how Grimsby was getting “worse every year” as it battled poverty and unemployment. Askedshe knew who she would vote for on December , she said: “Not at the moment, no. And who do you believe  We see all this poverty, all this desperation, every single day. But I don’t know who I will vote for. Who do you believe ”  In Grimsby, one in four residents are on low incomes and one in two children grow up in poverty. A new report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which works to tackle poverty in the UK, has found that low-income voters wield a lot of power in the upcoming election, but are largely ignored by political parties. The report said low-income voters are a large segment of the electorate, with about .million in total. Of those, .million can be characterised as swing voters. It also found that about one million Britons on low incomes - including , swing voters - are planning to vote for the first time next week. The foundation has urged political parties to listen to low-income voters, saying they have increasing power but continue to be locked out of policy-making and debate. Sixteen childrenaposs charities, led by Children in Scotland, have released an alternative election manesto, urging parties to tackle everything from poverty to climate change. The manesto urges the next government to end the benefit cap and readopt legally binding targets to reduce child poverty. Juliet Harris, Director of Together , one of the groups supporting the manesto, said: “It is shameful that in , child poverty is one of the most signicant human rights issues across the UK. Recent studies have found a rise in the number of Britons turning to foodbanks for help.

The Prime Minister has unveiled a series of pledgeshis party wins the election, but voters are understandably sceptical. This morning the Chancellor appeared on BBC Breakfast to face questions on the Tory pledges, including more funding for the NHS. Presenter Charlie Stayt pointed out that under the Tories, waiting times have risen to record levels, and grilled Mr Javid on why this hasnapost been dealt with up to now. NHS England data shows just .% of patients were admitted or treated within four hours - well below the governmentaposs target of %. The Tories have also pledged cross party talks about the UKaposs social care crisis - having failed to include a plan in their own manesto. Evencouncil tax goes up by % - double the rate of inflation - demand for services will outstrip the available cash, analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found. In contrast, Labouraposs manesto has allocated more than enough money to local government coffers, with £billion for day-to-day funding pledged by . Mr Stayt asked the Chancellor: Your Conservative government has been in power for  years and youaposve not tackled these things, youaposve not done whataposs required, and all of a sudden out of the blue in  days youaposre going to come up with solutions and answers and proposals, people will say why should we trust you now when you havenapost delivered before  In response Mr Javid claimed he was proud of the Conservative record. He claimed that priorities had been reset when Mr Johnson became Prime Minister, and described the pledges as the peopleaposs priorities. Mr Stayt asked: Youaposve been in charge when weaposve had these shocking times for waiting times. If it was a priority before, why has it become an issue now   Mr Javid admitted that funding the NHS is a challenge, but again attempted to deflect away from the Toriesapos shocking record. He said: The NHS year by year just to stand still needs more funding, weaposre all living longer, thereaposs new treatments and medicines, it is something to keep it there, you need to keep on looking at it and investing in it. Without the funding we will lose it, and for that we need a strong economy. Tories plan an increase in education spending and put forward legislation to raise NHS spending. The Conservatives have come under fire for their inability to address social care shortcomings.  Their manesto says: “We will build a cross-party consensus to bring forward an answer that solves the problem, commands the widest possible support, and stands the test of time. “That consensus will consider a range of options but one condition we do make is that nobody needing care should be forced to sell their home to pay for it.”The Toriesapos costings, published alongside the manesto, promised no new care funding.  Genevieve Edwards, Director of External Affairs at the MS Society, said: “We’re extremely disappointed by the lack of a concrete plan to mend our broken social care system. Boris Johnson announced on his first day as Prime Minister that he would fix this ‘once and for all’, yet we’re still in the dark about how and when this will be done. When NHS waiting times were released last month, Jeremy Corbyn branded the figures disgraceful. Labouraposs shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth posted on  Twitter : It’s official - the Tories have pushed our NHS into crisis.

According to The Times journalist Valentine Low, who was at the event, there was a bit of a mix-up from the Queen which is actually what caused the awkward moment.  Mr Low explained on Twitter , writing: OK, here goes... Princess Anne: the truth. No, she didnapost snub the Trumps. And she wasnapost told off by the Queen.Instead the Queen, after greeting the Donald , turned to Anne to see who was next. But there wasnapost anyone waiting: Trump was the last leader to be received by the Queen. Anne raised her hands in the air, laughed and said: Itaposs just me, adding a moment later and this lot as she pointed to the members of the household behind her.

Figures from Public Health England appear to show early circulation rates of flu, with a hospitalisation rate of . in every , people compared to . last week. The impact on the rise in cases on healthcare services is at moderate intensity. Parts of the north have seen a particular increase in flu cases in the last week, as the NHS prepares for what has been described as its hardest winter yet. Speaking about the impending winter crisis, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, from the British Medical Association, said doctors and patients look set to endure the worst winter on record.  He continued: Right now, the NHS is on a clf-edge. Without vastly increased investment in, and support for, the health service and staff, future years will see the situation deteriorate further. Norovirus outbreaks have also been reported this week, with one primary school forced to close as  pupils were struck down. Around a third of pupils from Rowlatts Mead Primary Academy in Leicester, were suffering with sickness and vomiting after an outbreak of the aposflu-like virusapos at the school. A spokeswoman for the trust which runs the school refused to name the virus saying she was taking advice issued by Public Health England. Pupils will be allowed back to classes today as the school, which has around  children enrolled, plans to reopen at .am.  Last week a norovirus outbreak closed Bangor Academy and Sixth Form College, in Northern Ireland, for several days after half its pupils called in sick A spokesperson for the Public Health Agency said: While it is not unusual to see an increase in illness at this time of year, we are urging people to take simple steps to help prevent the spread of illness. Respiratory illness, as well as other illnesses such as vomiting and diarrhoea, can be very common at this time of year. For most people they are short-term, unpleasant illnesses, with most of us getting better within a few days. However, we can all play our part in keeping illnesses at bay and helping to protect more vulnerable people, for whom they can present a more serious risk. We would urge people to get the flu vaccineeligible, take extra care with hand hygiene and,you are feeling unwell, take simple steps to prevent the spread.

Residents including parents with pushchairs have been forced to walk in the road to get round the eyesore. Mixed into the ft mound of muck is bags of clothes, cupboards, a fridge-freezer, a headboard and broken parts of a sofa. The rubbish has now been on the Birmingham pavement since Friday, November . Shaun McRobert, , said: “Most of the pathway is blocked, people are being forced to walk into the road and speeding is a really bad problem here. It’s an eyesore - having to walk past that every day is a joke. It should have been removed by now, it’s a health and safety thing.” There could be broken glass, anything inside of there, one little mistake and someone could end up getting hurt. Bader, , said he was particularly affected as the waste spilled across the front of his house. He added: It’s really bad, we have trouble getting out of the house with the prams. It’s going to attract rats, mice and it’s going to affect my house because I am the one closest. It’s too dangerous and you have to walk in the road to get out, it’s really annoying.”  Nabil Guennoun claimed not to have seen anything this bad in his five years of living in the street. The -year-old said: It’s no good, it’s dangerous, especially when all the cars are parked, he said. One resident, who asked not be named, said it was a major inconvenience to her and her family. She said: When you’re walking with the kids you have to walk around it, it’s dangerous. The leaves and mud are a mess in itself but to have that - it’s just messy. We’ve had this kind of behaviour forever. There’s rubbish that stays there for weeks and weeks and nothing is done. The manager of the property behind where the rubbish was dumped said the mess was due to a previous tenant.  He said: I’m a victim, just like everybody . On Wednesday afternoon he said efforts were being made to remove the rubbish by the evening. A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said: “Following reports from member of the public, we were made aware of this incident - which is now being investigated. As it is under investigation we cannot make any further comment in detail.

As I ring the bell at Bubbles, a pair of eyes give me the once-over through the gap of a little hatch in the door. The owners and workers at Bubbles Spa have no idea who I am and why Iaposm here. Just an ordinary punter on a cold and rainy evening, looking for a sensual massage. My heart is pounding. The owner of the eyes peering through the door seems satisfied that I am no threat to security or the women who work here.  Iaposm let in and led to a vestibule, where a woman apologises for smelling of cigarettes. She asks for a name and I give her one. Someone aposs name. The name of a friend, in fact. It was the first to come into my head. She must be used to this. She has clocked me as a Bubbles virgin and explains the tarfs. It’s £ to get in the building for a massage but for an extra fiver you get an hour, rather than  minutes. I decline. Thirty minutes is probably enough. Maybe this is a special offer for this evening. Then you have to pay for the actual massage. Fishnet stockings and a lacy bra Prices start at £ and for that you get a massage from a scantily clad woman.  For £ your masseuse will be topless, for £ sheaposll be naked and £ gets you a massage in one of the VIP rooms.  I pay the initial £ quid in cash and wonder how the finance department will view my expenses claim for a sensual erotic massage at Bubbles. In the waiting room, I find a woman sitting on a settee wearing a short black tunic with buttons diagonally dotted down the front, fishnet stockings, a lacy bra and pants set. Enough buttons of her tunic are undone for her bra to be visible. Given her attire, youaposd perhaps expect a pair of heels but sheaposs wearing what look like black trainers. They look slightly incongruous. Still,you work on your feet, it makes sense to wear flats. There does not seem to be any other clients while I’m there.  Seeing someone you recognise might feel awkward and potentially blow my cover. Hello dad, fancy seeing you here. Long time no see, Reverend. That kind of conversation. The woman leads me down a corridor into a massage room then leaves me to shower. I wash and wrap a towel around myself. There is a hair on the soap in the cubicle. Is it one of mine  Maybe. The place is clean,a little shabby in places. aposDo you want me naked apos On hershe asks whether I want to be massaged with oil or lotion and explains that oil gets to your muscles more easily. Lotion is quicker to wash off, she explains. I opt for oil. Do you want me naked  I ask. She does. OK. The towel is draped over a chair and Iaposm naked in front of a woman I met just minutes earlier. This is a first, for what itaposs worth.  Thereaposs tinny music coming from the TV in the waiting room. I lie face down on the massage table, feeling very exposed. At least itaposs warm. She starts to work her hands up my thighs. In the mirror on the wall I can see her legs. Her tunic isn’t long enough to cover her buttocks and I can see her underwear as the tunic rises and falls with the rhythm as she bends over to work her hands across my legs. There is small talk. I concoct a dreary back-story about where I work. She says itaposs been quiet because weaposre approaching Christmas. When the weather ’s bad or the football’s on it’s totally dead, she says.Perhaps Derby County supporters make up a big proportion of the clientele, I suggest. They might come later andthey do they’re sometimes totally out of their faces. They can be a bit of a handful, she explains. Lots of the girls have their own regular customers though. She talks about worries for her family and the future. Sheaposs self-employed sothe clients dry up then so does her income. It is like the kind of conversation when you’re at the barbers. Only in the buff, obviously. You get to be the masseuse She tries the soft sell. With naked massage you have the option of body massage where the woman will massage you with her breasts. Just thought I’d let you know this for future reference. You can give the girl a massage as well, like a reverse massage, she says. I ask: Do you get many massages   Yes, especially in the VIP rooms, she says. You’ve got a Jacuzzi as well. Is that part of the VIP package  Yeh, we’ve got two VIP rooms, one with the Jacuzzi when the lady will assist you into the Jacuzzi either before or after your massage, she says. The lady will come into the Jacuzzi with you. It’s your choice whether you have it before or after your massage. Itaposs doubtful my expenses claim would stretch to the Jacuzzi package. Naked and exposed In the other room we have a double bed. It’s a lot better for the body-to-body massage and the reverse massage. It’s quite popular, especially the bedroom one, she explains. The massage table Iaposm on is quite narrow and to get two people on safely presents a risk of falling off.  Do you want to turn over sweetheart  she asks. I roll over onto my back and feel more naked and more exposed. There is a mirror on the ceiling too. I’ve never felt more naked. I watch her work the oil into my thighs, stomach and chest. Muffled voices can be heard from other rooms. He was just f****** horrible. Stocked up on woollies, clothes, jumpers, you have to, donapost cha  The masseuse gets closer, more intimate. My hand is by the side of the table and her stockinged thigh occasionally presses against it. Impossible to know whether this is accidental or part of the service. Her hands move closer to an area where a sports massage therapist would tend to avoid. I tell her that Iaposm not comfortable with her hands too close to my groin. OK, that’s fine, she says.  To be clear, weaposre not accusing anyone of wrongdoing or unlawful activity. Everyone has to make a living. Thereaposs some animated chatter from the waiting room. Complaints about boyfriends. Canned laughter from the TV. Can you do me up  someone asks. A telephone rings in the distance. aposSweetheartapos Conversation with the masseuse sparks up again. How many clients does she see each day  A good day...I say a good day...a busy day, five or six. You’re self-employed here. Doing all your own tax and stuff. Some days you don’t get any. You have to think of the future, especially with children, you’ve got to think of their futures as well. Is there anything less erotic than talking about tax and pension planning  Feel free to jump in the shower, sweetheart. She leaves the room and I shower again. On herthereaposs more chat.

Paula Lydamore, , from Clton, Nottinghamshire, was diagnosed with type one diabetes when she was just five years old. Doctors have told her she will eventually go blind due to a rare complication known as diabetic retinopathy, where the retina is damaged due to high blood sugar levels. Ms Lydamore says her vision is so impaired that she feels asshe has been flashbanged due to a distracting white light that hampers her vision.It has been a nightmare, she told NottinghamshireLive .If it was not for having to be with my son I think I would have just given up. I cannot play on my phone, I cannot read properly, I cannot do anything. It is really disorientating. I went to walk my little boy to school andit was not for him shouting me I would have walked out into the road and into a car. I canapost even do that anymore. I just end up staring into thin air. Ms Lydamore is now reliant on the help of her ex-partner, Alan Fallows, who has become her carer, and her son, Kyden. They have been left in a desperate situation after accommodation in Loughborough, Leicestershire, had fallen through. They had no other options but to seek help from Nottingham City Councilaposs housing aid team. The organisation have offered her numerous temporary accommodation options but were deemed unsuitable due to her needs. Nottingham City Council said it realised the emergency bed and breakfast accommodation she was first helped into was not ideal and herself. Kyden and Mr Fallows agreed to be placed into a family hostel after declining the first offer, arguing it was simply not suitable for someone who is partially blind. The [council] pointed out they did not want to keep putting me in hotels, so they put us in Mellors Lodge on November , she said. [The room] was on the first floor, but it was up four flights of stairs and my son pointed outthere was an emergency how would I get down these stairsthe lt was out of order  I cannot guide myself. They had these sensor lights in there and it felt like I was getting flashbanged when they turned on.  It seems like I am being picky. Itaposs not the best scenario but even being on the ground floor with suitable lighting would help. Itaposs just acknowledging that I have a disability. They said they had no choice but to leave the hostel on November  after just four nights, and are now sofa surfing with friends and family. Alan Fallows, , said he has stayed by Ms Lydamore as a friend and now helps care for her and her son. The former construction worker said he was earning around £ to £ per week before he left his job and offered to look after her. Now, he says, he is given just £ each month in carersapos allowance. I have watched a very good friend crumble with her eyesight, he said. Anything that happens to her or Kyden will come back to me so I look after them. I have to do all her medication andKyden needs collecting it comes down to me. She suffers with her eyes on a normal day but these lights were really hurting her. Ms Lydamore added: There is not a lot of help for people like Alan. I thank God that he still wants to help. On Tuesday, December , Ms Lydamore said she finally underwent a risk assessment and hopes to find somewhere that is suitable for someone with a disability.  Mr Fallows said he is hoping that afterwards, things might begin to look up.

The Prince of Wales is said to have told Andrew there was no way back for him after the Duke of York stepped down from royal duties over his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. It came after Prince Philip told his son to take his punishment in a tense meeting a week ago, a new report claims. Andrew, , was summoned to the Queenaposs Sandringham estate in Norfolk to face strong words from Prince Charles on Monday. The showdown came just hours before BBC Panorama aired its interview with Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein and alleges she was forced to have sex with the duke on three occasions, including when she was . Andrew has denied her claims in several statements from Buckingham Palace and in a disastrous BBC Newsnight interview last month. In the fallout from that interview, the Queen forced the duke to step back from royal duties as he dragged the Royal Family into the scandal and faced calls to cooperate with an FBI investigation into child sex trafficking allegations against Epstein. On Monday, Andrew was summoned to Sandringham from his home in Windsor to face Charles, , in an apparent move to reinforce the their motheraposs decision, thereported. A source told the newspaper: It was all very civilised but Charles calmly read him the riot act and told him there was no way back for him in the near future. Andrew thought he was being treated harshly as nothing has yet been proved ... but he accepted the decision. He really had little choice.  Another source said: The feeling is that with Prince Philip retired at  and the Queen now , Charles has to take a firm grip on the family and plan for the future. Andrewaposs meeting with Charles came a week after the duke sat down with his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, who has been staying at Sandringham. A source described it as a tense meeting in which Philip told his to take his punishment and step down from royal duties for the sake of the monarchy. In her Panorama interview, Mrs Giuffre,  and now living in Australia, said she was left horried and ashamed after her alleged sexual encounter with Andrew.  There was a bath and it started there and then led into the bedroom, she said. It didnapost last very long, the whole entire procedure. It was disgusting. He wasnapost mean or anything but he got up and he said aposthanksapos and walked out. I sat there in bed, just horried and ashamed and felt dirty. I had to get up and have a shower. She called on the British public to stand up beside her in her fight, saying the duke was the most hideous dancer Iaposve ever seen in my le and his sweat was ... raining basically everywhere at Londonaposs Tramp nightclub in . She said: I was just like grossed out from it, but I knew I had to keep him happy because thataposs what Jeffrey and Ghislainewould have expected from me.  Mrs Gufre claims she was trafficked by the paedophile financier Epstein and forced to have sex with Andrew when she was a teenager, which the duke categorically denies. The Panorama investigation broadcast on BBC One on Monday night disclosed that five women who allege they were victims of paedophile Epstein are calling on Andrew to give a testimony in their civil court case. They claim the duke saw people being given massages at Epsteinaposs homes. The Queenaposs second son, who stepped down from public duties just over a week ago, insisted in his disastrous Newsnight interview that he did not witness or suspect any suspicious behaviour during his visits to Epsteinaposs homes in Florida, New York and the Caribbean. Panorama claimed it had also uncovered an email allegedly sent by Andrew in  to Ms Maxwell, who is accused of procuring girls for Epstein. She denies the claims and has not been charged with a crime.  In it, the duke is reported to have asked for Ms Maxwellaposs help in dealing with claims by Ms Gufre, who was previously known as Virginia Roberts. It was sent at .am on January ,  after Mrs Giuffre lodged court papers in the US. The duke is said to have written: Let me know when we can talk. Got some specic questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts. Ms Maxwell replies: Have some info. Call me when you have a moment. Mrs Gufre alleged how she was brought to London by Epstein in , introduced to Andrew and taken to Tramp nightclub, and asked by the duke to dance.  She told Panorama reporter Darragh Macintyre: He is the most hideous dancer Iaposve ever seen in my le. It was horrible and this guy was sweating all over me, his sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere, I was just like grossed out from it, but I knew I had to keep him happy because thataposs what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would have expected from me. In his recent Newsnight interview, Andrew claimed he had a medical condition in , after suffering an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when he was shot at, which meant he did not sweat. When they had left the club, Mrs Giuffre said the socialite Ms Maxwell, Epsteinaposs then-girlfriend, gave her instructions. In the car Ghislaine tells me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey and that just made me sick, she said. She said that later that evening she had sex with Andrew upstairs at Ms Maxwellaposs house in Belgravia. The duke has denied meeting Ms Giuffre, saying: I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe likes of John Lewis and MS may grab the headlines when it comes to tear-jerking Christmas adverts. However, a DIY store from a small town in Mid-Wales is giving the retail giants a run for its money with an advert that has been hailed the best of the festive season - and cost just £. The adorable two-minute clip from Hafod Hardware in Rhayader, Powys, Wales, took just one day to film and features two-year-old Arthur Jones. Arthuraposs proud dad Tom Jones, whose family owns the independent shop, and film-maker friend Josh Holdaway incredibly filmed and edited the video for less than £.  The heart-melting clip has already won over the hearts of customers in the small town and has also grabbed a nationwide audience since being uploaded online. The video begins with little Arthur getting out of bed before donning his apron and carrying out a dayaposs aposworkapos at the family-run hardware store. Sweeping the floors, polishing the counter and replacing stocks on the shelves are all part of his duties as the busy boy is also on hand to deal with customers - all with a friendly smile and big thumbs up. The commercial - which features four generations of Tomaposs family - has a special twist at the end withArthur shutting up shop before carrying home a Christmas tree. It features a cover of Alphavilleaposs  hit aposForever Youngapos, performed by American singer-songwriter Andrea von Kampen. It is the third year in a row that Hafod Hardware, which opened in  and is one of the oldest businesses in the town, have released a Christmas advert.  The previous commercials have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times to huge acclaim and Tom is again hoping to once again put a smile on peopleaposs faces. Tom, , said: The aim is to make it the best Christmas advert of the year. The comments weaposve had so far have been amazing.  Making this video with my son has been an experience I will cherish for a letime. They say never work with animals or children but he was a joy. Heaposs such a bright boy and I would be lyingI said it was dficult to get him to perform on screen.  He often comes to visit me in the shop, so werenapost really asking him to do anything he hadnapost done before. Whenever I watch the advert, it makes me well up with pride. Forever Young was the song I really wanted. I asked Andreashe could do a cover and she was happy to do it. She recorded it in a studio and paid  for a sound engineer. I said weaposd pay - so thataposs all the advert has cost us. Sheaposs got an incredible voice, itaposs perfect for the advert. All three adverts touch upon the signicance of family at Christmas and so it was extremely important to me that Arthur had a role in each one.  Showing the transition of him as a young baby in the first advert, through to the young man he is today, really does capture the essence of what we have been trying to create. We are told every year that Christmas is for kids, but thereaposs nothing stopping us all from being big kids at Christmas. All the time, people are coming into the shop and asking us about our Christmas adverts. Even strangers pop in to say theyaposve seen them. People are always asking whether we were doing another one this year. Itaposs hard to say no, we feel obliged to do it.  The locals love them. Itaposs nice to think we can put a lot of smiles on peopleaposs faces in the community. Itaposs always nice to do something for the town. People always compare our videos to the likes of John Lewis and we try to get the same message across as the mutli-million pound adverts do. But there is an underlying message. We are just a small independent shop in Mid Wales trying to compete with the big boys like John Lewis and MS.

A weather front will bring blustery showery weather through to Saturday and Sunday and a weather system of low pressure could make things a bit colder, so some signs of frost in Somerset could be possible.

Unsettled blustery showers are expected to hit on Monday, which could turn wintry over higher ground in the north.The heaviest showers will be seen along North Sea coastal areas, with the northwest staying dry, while it will be rather cold with some patchy frost overnight.Unsettled weather is predicted to persist over the next few weeks,  with showers or longer spells of rain and drier periods being short-lived.

The loud creaks of separating ice blocks and the unnerving cracks of falling boulders puncture the stillness. After losing an unprecedented nine metres in depth this summer, the surface of the Mer de Glace – the Sea of Ice – is no longer the flawless sheet of white and blue that attracted hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. What was one of the most beautul locations in Europe a decade ago now resembles a construction site. Any politicians doubting climate change need only come here to see the alarming evidence of our rapidly warming planet. The statistics of how the Mer de Glace has melted in the last decades simply cannot be disputed. On marker posts all the way down from the Montenvers mountain railway station that brings up visitors from nearby Chamonix, you can see how this mighty glacier – the second longest in the Alps – is disappearing daily. It is officially . miles long and  metres deep, but the measurements are shting with each season. The descent begins on a winding path through a forest, where the first marker shows the height of the glacier in .  As the markers get closer to the present day, they start to appear more regularly.

The loss from year to year is enormous. This summer we lost nine metres. The worst case scenario predicted by the scientists was six. “It’s going down and down uncontrollably. It makes me sick to watch it happening. It is heartbreaking.” Walking up to the edge of the deep blue ice cave, closed to the public, I am wary of going further. It feels like the whole structure could crash. Speaking at his office in Chamonix, Mathieu says the disappearance of the glacier is just one of the negative effects of climate change he is having to deal with. He said: “We have also had a lot more dangerous rock falls. “When you live in a city you know it’s hotter, but you don’t realise the full extent of climate change. When you come here, you think, ‘Oh my god!’” Mathieu and his team are preparing to remove the steps down to the glacier in the next decade and a horizontal walkway will be installed. A new climate change education centre is also planned. Climbing back up from the glacier to the station I take one last longing look over my shoulder. Not because I fear may I never be able to , but because I fear the glacier will not be there when I do. Arctic heats up by .C The Arctic has warmed as much in the past decade as the rest of the planet has in  years. With  set to be one of the warmest years on record, scientists found that the Arctic has warmed by .C in the past  years alone.

Mr Finlay and his we then made their way to the Italian Grill where Mr Finlay was refused service in his intoxicated state. He was abrasive and belligerent with officers.#Given the circumstances the chief constable considers that the applicationbe refused.#Finlay had a not guilty plea to indecent exposure accepted in court, but he pleaded guilty to an amended charge of threatening and abusive behaviour.His solicitor, Kris Gilmartin, said the exposure of his buttocks had not been malicious.Mr Gilmartin said: #His behaviour at the Italian Grill was entirely regrettable and is something he regrets.#He was with his we and both had consumed probably too much alcohol. He has paid compensation to the people involved and apologised to them and the matter, as I understand it from their point of view, is closed.#There were other allegations made by Police Scotland and they were found to be wanting in court when properly addressed.#The CCTV had shown that Mr Finlay#s buttocks are exposed, but it is apparent that has really been an unfortunate situation when he has been walking across the road # his buttocks have been exposed for a very short period of time.#It#s dficult for me to comprehend why it would be necessary to refuse such a licence.#Mr Finlay has been a licence holder for some ten years and has never been before the committee before. He stands here with one blot on his character.#The shame-faced bar manager told the licensing board: #This was out of character and I#m sitting here embarrassed and red-faced.

Danny Johnson did brilliantly with a fantastic finish to equalise.“At the end, Jordon had to put his hands up but he’s been excellent all season and that mistake just came at an unfortunate time.“We back him to the hilt because he’s been great for us.”Dundee - Queen of the South: Dramatic Dobbie double adds to dark blue despair\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee---queen-of-the-south-dramatic-dobbie-double-adds-to-dark-blue-despair embed # secretTZCxihCwF\" data-secret\"TZCxihCwF\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “I don’t think we deserved anything from the game to be brutally honest.“However, to get back level showed a good bit of character from the boys and it was a fantastic finish.“But then the end of the game was unfortunate and not what we want. It’s happened, we have to move on from it now.”After Forster’s howler, boos rang out around Dens and the -year-old goalkeeper insists the club’s supporters are right to let the players know they’re not happy.“I % accept what the fans are saying right now,” Hamilton added.“They pay their money and are a massive part of this club. They can voice their opinion.“Things aren’t going well and it’s clear they will make that known. We’re not happy about it either but it’s something we are trying to recty.”Confidence may be low but Hamilton insists the talent is there at Dens Park to turn things around this weekend.The goalie added: “If anybody gets beat three times in a row then confidence will get hit but there’s no point feeling down and going into our shells.“We need to get back on the training field and get a smile on our faces and get back to winning games.“I think anybody looking at the squad they’ll say it’s fantastic but there’s only so long we can get away with saying how fantastic our squad is.“We need to start putting results and points on the board.”Saturday was a bittersweet game for the goalkeeper as he made hisfollowing an appendix scare that kept him out of action for almost six weeks.“I got home after the Partick game and ended up getting my appendix out a day later.“It was a shock, pretty scary because I went from feeling ill to seeing the doctor and next minute I’m under the kne getting surgery.“I’m back now and feeling good.

Can we get more from him and get him to take the ball in and get us up the pitch “He’s working really hard on that. Neller is the same.“It’s not all about goals. The three strikers all have dferent qualities but there are goals in all three and we need to create the chances for them.”He added: “That’s an underlying thing to come out of the last few games.“We’ve not been creating the same amount of chances.“We’ve gone from being a very dangerous looking team to the one that we’re seeing now. Stats don’t tell you everything but they don’t lie.“We’ve not troubled goalkeepers enough. Our keeper was troubled more than theirs on Saturday which shouldn’t really be happening.“Teams will look to nully our threats, particularly at Dens but we’ve got plenty of players who can trouble teams.”This weekend Dundee face an Arbroath side that have surprised a few this campaign, picking up  points from their opening  matches as they ed to the second tier after winning League One last term.James knows his team will have nothing given to him by Dick Campbell’s side but is backing them to put on an improved showing.“I’ve still got the belief and I think that deep down the players do as well,” he added.“We’ve got to be brave because at the weekend there will be  guys looking forward to playing against us and looking at the game thinking ‘this is a good time to play Dundee’.“It’s our job to get the confidence back up.”The Dark Blues expect to have Nelson and Josh Meekings back available this weekend.Hopes on the availability of left-back Jordan Marshall, however, are lower as he continues to recover from a hamstring problem.The Dens boss said: “Nelson is a positive one. His foot got injected at the back end of last week and he can run now.“It’s a case of when it’s settled enough to let him kick the ball.“Hopefully, he’ll be available at the weekend and the same goes for Meeks.”On Marshall, however, he added: “Because it’s a hamstring we’re still slightly concerned.“Everything is crossed that he can build up to the high speed stuff in training.“He seems positive and you hope there’s no reaction.”Jamie Ness limped off on Saturday and a calf injury will keep him out for the weekend, though, the damage isn’t as bad as first feared.Paul McGowan, meanwhile, will be ready toafter his young child took ill late last week.“The baby is home,” James added. “Everybody at the club is glad about that and, hopefully, the wee one continues to recover.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/medw-tele-sports-podcast-twa-teams-1-846x564.jpg ","title":"time for dee players to step up and do it for dens manager mcpake","story":"There has been a lot of clamour from fans to see Dundee get rid of manager James McPake but it’s too soon for thatyou ask me.The recent run of defeats has been undoubtedly bad and extremely concerning for the Dark Blues.However, you’ve got to back him to turn things around.He’s a young manager, still learning his trade andhe was the man in the summer to get the club back up he surely still is now.There remains a lot to play for this campaign and I’d caution the club’s owners to keep their powder dry right now.The good thing is James has the right people with a lot of experience around him to help out.Gordon Strachan is, obviously, a well-seasoned manager at the highest level and will surely be doing everything he can to help the Dens gaffer.Also Jimmy Nicholl as his assistant will be invaluable and first-team coach Dave Mackay, a man I played with at Dens, will be doing all he can to help turn things around.Saying all that, Dundee really need to win at Arbroath this coming weekend, for the manager’s sake.Dundee - Queen of the South: Dramatic Dobbie double adds to dark blue despair\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee---queen-of-the-south-dramatic-dobbie-double-adds-to-dark-blue-despair embed # secretjdaFGf\" data-secret\"jdaFGf\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Losing four on the bounce and dropping below the Red Lichties and out of the play-off spots would be a disaster for the Dark Blues.They have already lost touch with Dundee United at the top of the table and have fallen five points behind Inverness in second spot.Ayr could move six points aheadthey win tonight against Dunfermline.

build it on land at the Foresterhill Health Campus as well as instruct finance chiefs to begin talks on finance, design and construction.According to a report being discussed by the health authority’s board, the new mortuary would replace existing facilities – one at Foresterhill built in  and the other at Queen Street.The documents said they are in “poor physical condition” with the possibility of upgrading them limited due to “space constraints.”NHS Grampian’s board papers said any new facility would cover the entire north-east as well as Orkney and Shetland and would be used by dferent organisations.It also said the upgrade would meet the necessary standards required by medics and other organisations.The report said: “Development of the new facility will result in the replacement of the two existing Aberdeen- based mortuaries with a purpose-built state-of-the-art facility.“This new facility will be operated as a single integrated multi-partner, multi-purpose mortuary serving all providers including NHS Grampian, Aberdeen City Council, Aberdeenshire Council, Moray Council, Orkney and Shetland Island Councils, the University of Aberdeen, Crown Office Procurator Fiscal Service and Police Scotland.“Both facilities in Aberdeen are no longer fit for purpose, do not lend themselves to modernisation and have been highlighted as requiring improvement by clinicians, service managers and by members of the public who have had occasion to attend the existing mortuaries.”The new mortuary would be built at a site between the new Foresterhill Health Centre and a warehouse on the Foresterhill health campus.It was chosen because it is close to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and can easily accessed."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 11

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"harry potter halloween at pony club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHarry Potter was the theme for this year’s Hallowe’en Fun Day organised by Argyll South Pony Club at the Long Walk arena near Kilmartin.Even the judges # Ulla Riddell and Mary Lou Aitchison – got into the spirit of the day by dressing as Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed.

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in.

Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

The children will also learn about fire safety to keep humans and animals safe.Meghan, from Dunbar, was awarded a posthumous First Class Honours degree from Edinburgh Napier University, where she was studying veterinary nursing, following her death in December .In a statement, her mum and dad said: ldquoWe remember Meghan talking about meeting Lesley and how excited she was about the prospect of being involved with Fostering Compassion. The workshop is such a lovely way to keep Meghanrsquos memory alive.Each Fostering Compassion workshop includes the donation of lsquogts of compassionrsquo from the children to animals in need.Through the Animal Heroes workshops, funds will be raised to donate Smokey Paws oxygen mask kits, used by firefighters to resuscitate animals pulled from fires, to each of the  fire stations in the Lothians, Borders and Fe, which do not yet have them.These gts help encourage compassion and empathy in the children and at the same time, with the blessing of her family, will help keep Meghanrsquos memory alive.Miss Winton added: ldquoMeghan was also a firm believer of lsquorandom acts of kindnessrsquo and created the lsquoWishing Treersquo in Pressmennan Woods in East Lothian where she hung inspirational messages full of hope and love. Both these gestures and activities will be incorporated in the workshop and the children will be encouraged to continue them at home to build on positive behavioural changes as a result of attending the Fostering Compassion activities.ldquoThe idea of the Animal Heroes workshop came to me almost four years ago around the time Meghanrsquos and my paths first crossed and she put me in touch with her father. After her devastating accident, I was determined the workshop would come to fruition, but would be done as a tribute to her.ldquoWe are greatly honoured to have her familyrsquos blessing to do this and thank them very much for their unwavering support.Fostering Compassion runs animal and nature-themed workshops for children in foster care and kinship care.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him. But for once he was glad of his invisibility. If the manager had ever recognised him outside then John would probably lose his job.ldquoYour costume is in the back room. You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate.

The bar has stood on that corner since  and was historically known as The Corona until . In its latter years The Corona bar was hardly a jewel in Shawlandsrsquo crown, with a less than glowing reputation. The news of a takeover by the owners of The Shed who planned to expand their Butterfly and The Pig brand South to Shawlands was widely welcomed news.Fast forward to Autumn  and the venue changed hands once again, this time to a Southside couple with a view to give Shawlands a community bar and kitchen worthy of this historic corner of Shawlands.Southsiders born and bred, the new owners are locals to Shawlands and the bar and restaurant scene. They currently operate a popular city centre live music venue and have both managed and operated venues in and around the Southside most of their working lives.When asked about their newest venture the owners said: ldquoThis is such an iconic building and an integral part of Shawlandsrsquo history so when it came to choosing a name, it could ever only be The Corona. We added Bar  Kitchen because this is not going to be the old Corona pub of the rsquos. itrsquos a place for families and friends to meet, celebrate and relax, a real reflection of Shawlands today. In terms of looking back, the name is merely a nod to the distant past, it wouldnrsquot feel right branding this building with any other name when locally itrsquos still fondly referred to as The Corona.With the bar having big plans for the future with new menus, entertainment and family events, come along to this vibrant, buzzing bar and see for yourself.The Corona Bar  Kitchen Pollokshaws Road, Glasgow, G YFwww.facebook CoronaBarAndKitchen----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Glasgow Music City ToursGlasgows music scene is world famous and, since , Glasgow Music City Tours have helped people explore it with their guided walks.By visiting existing venues and disturbing the ghosts of former performance spaces, the tours tell the story of the artists who have stayed, played and made music in Glasgow, the UKs first UNESCO City of Music.The tours are led by enthusiastic musicians, fans and writers who encourage guests to share their stories of memorable gigs.As well as private tours, Glasgow Music City Tours run three scheduled tours every Saturday from Easter until the end of the season.The Merchant City Music - Past and Present tour tells the tale of the areas major music venues from Barrowland Ballroom to Britannia Panopticon via the City Halls, Old Fruitmarket, Mono and the th Note.Starting at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and ending at King Tuts, the Music Mile tour takes in the sights and sounds of the city centre.

Not just for glaciers that have lakes in front of them, but also those that donrsquot have lakes leave behind signs of how big they used to be and these landforms are a record of where the glacier was in colder times.ldquoNow you can see glaciers have thinned by up to a  metres.Measuring the changes in the Himalayas, which has many of the worldrsquos highest mountains, was no easy feat because of the sheer scale of the landscape.Mr King added: ldquoBecause the mountains are so steep and big, the weathering rates are really high, so therersquos a lot of rock and avalanche debris that works its way down the glaciers. Once that debris gets thick enough, it can act as a bit of a blanket on the glacier it falls on that can protect the ice underneath, so the front generally doesnrsquot recede as much.The change the team documented is the height change in the glacier rather than the change in .Mr Bolch said: ldquoOur results have important implications for future projections of ice loss from the region because the interaction of glaciers and glacial lakes has not previously been considered in future glacier ice loss estimates."},{"url":null,"title":"cash-reserves-report-reveals-28m-benefit-scotlands-nature-spots","story":"Nature reserves are home to important natural habitats and species and give visitors the chance to experience the best of nature in Scotland.However, a new study has found that as well as these recognisable benefits, their worth to the public goes way beyond this.Scottish Natural Heritagehas measured the value of natural capital across its reserves, with the report - the first of its kind in Scotland - revealing that they are worth an estimated pound million to the public each year.The National Nature Reservescapital is made up of numerous climate, tourism, recreation, and health benefits which are present across the ,ha of land owned and managed by SNH.Francesca Osowska, chief executive of the heritage body, claimed the study shows the many advantages of nature as an asset.She said: ldquoThis innovative report vividly illustrates that our nature reserves are providing an outstandingon investment of time, money and resources.ldquoNature is an asset, but one we need to protect and invest in. Key to this is tackling climate change impacts ndash and nature is a solution.ldquoWe need a rich iety of le to be able to sustain food supplies, water and the air we breathe. But itrsquos not just about conservation - enhancing our nature is also part of the solution to the climate emergency.ldquoOur nature reserves are critical to our work of ensuring a nature-rich future for Scotland.Natural capital is the stock of Scotlandrsquos plants, wildle, air, water, and land providing benefits to the people and businesses across the country.SNH claims that assessing the monetary value of natural capital is one way to show how nature provides many benefits to everyone in their everyday lives.Using the natural capital approach to understand naturersquos wider benefits can in turn help businesses and other organisations to make more informed decisions based on a broader picture which includes important environmental factors.The reportrsquos calculations include volunteers contributing , days of work worth a total of pound, SNH land sequestering carbon, mainly through its woodland and saltmarsh habitats, worth poundm and air quality filtration benefits amounting to pound,.Other benefits valued in the report include food, education, renewable energy production, and health and well-being.Annual management costs were estimated at pound.million, which means the estimated benefits of SNH land outweigh the costs by eight to one.The true capital benefits may be much higher, however, as it is not currently possible to measure the other advantages of nature reserves, such as water quality, mental health benefits and flood risk mitigation.The report was welcomed by Dr Deborah Long, chief officer for Scottish Environment LINK, who said the study helped to demonstrate the value of the countryrsquos nature reserves.She said: ldquoScotlandrsquos National Nature Reservesare the jewels in Scotlandrsquos crown as a nature rich nation.ldquoThis new report recognises the monetary value of NNRs and very clearly shows why investment in nature is absolutely crucial in the fight against climate change and the ongoing nature declines, shown in the recent State of Nature Scotland report, and which are happening in Scotland as well as the rest of the world.ldquoIn fact, NNRs are the very best places for nature ndash we all need to be ensuring nature continues to do well in NNRs and the investment not just in managing these reserves but in monitoring how nature is doing is vital.ldquoWith the calculated value of pound million a year, plus the uncalculated value of nature in NNRs for human physical and mental health, as well as ecosystem services like flood protection and clean water, we can very clearly see why investment in nature is fundamental to people and nature and for future generations.SNH is the first public body to publish natural capital accounts for their land in Scotland.It is hoped it may provide a template for other public bodies to follow in considering this approach.Read the full report at https:bit.ly MFWe.To find out more about Scotlandrsquos NNRs, see www.nnr.scot."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  More female leaders offers hope of safer  stronger world","story":"Within a decade of that declaration,   set the wheels spinning on what promises to become a century or more of exceptional chaos and carnage in the middle east, and far beyond.Everyone can get it wrong, especially those whose closely argued ideas are reduced to soundbites. And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10752125.jpg?type=article-full","title":"greenpeace-calls-ocean-sanctuaries-capture-carbon-save-wildlife","story":"A report from Greenpeace highlights the role of the oceans as the worlds largest \"carbon sink\", storing large amounts of the carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere by human activity, as well as heat as the planet warms.But the continued reliance on burning fossil fuels and the carbon dioxide emissions it causes has led to ocean heating, sea level rises and increasingly acidic seawater - with rapid and large-scale impacts on people and wildle.The changing climate and loss of marine wildle and habitats are threatening the processes that allow the oceans to store carbon, the report warns.There is a need to drastically cut emissions to curb climate change, Greenpeace said.At the same time, a network of ocean sanctuaries, off limits to human activity, would help marine areas be more resilient to the changing climate and protect \"blue carbon\" stores.These stores of carbon in the seas are the largest on Earth, containing  times the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and  times the amount in land-based vegetation, soils and microbes combined, Greenpeace said.The campaign group is calling on governments to agree a global ocean treaty in  to safeguard the worlds oceans, and to commit to protecting at least % of the oceans by  when they meet at a key nature conference next year, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in Beijing.The poles, whale hotspots, coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass meadows should be among the priorities for protection, the report said.Louisa Casson, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: \"The climate crisis is an ocean crisis.\"The ocean is fundamental to keeping our planet healthy, but for too long we have treated marine protection as a separate issue to the climate crisis.\"We must protect our ocean, the biggest carbon sink on earth, and stop burning fossil fuels.\"And she said: \"From mangroves and seagrass meadows, to whales and krill, the oceans biology is one of our best allies in the fight against climate change.\"But over-exploitation and our addiction to fossil fuels has pushed our ocean to the brink of collapse.\"We need urgent, concerted action on a global scale to properly protect at least % of our ocean and safeguard its vast stores of blue carbon.\"Ocean protection is climate action, andwe can save our ocean, it can save us.\""},{"url":null,"title":"holding-politicians-account-duty-not-bore","story":"Tuesday nightrsquos encounter was not an exact replacement for Kylersquos late and unlamented three ring circus.

To wit: Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland, being held to account and feeling the heat.: Ferry fiasco as Ministers suedEarlier that day, the results of the  Programme for International Student Assessmentsurvey had been published, and they did not make welcome reading for Scotlandrsquos pupils. Scotlandrsquos educational performance, on which the country has always prided itself ndash rightly or wrongly ndash was revealed to be a dangerously leaning tower. Reading levels were up, but performances in maths and science were falling and at record lows. Lindsay Paterson, professor of education policy at Edinburgh University, described Scotlandrsquos overall performance as ldquostagnating in mediocrity.As well as being taken to task on education, the subject on which she has asked to be judged first and foremost, the First Minister was asked about the state of Scotlandrsquos hospitals.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"description\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media iFShJ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests iFShJ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": This was not the first time she had been tackled on the subject on television. There was Andrew Neilrsquos now famous question to her on November  in his BBC show.After stating that only two of eight waiting time targets had been hit, Neil went on: ldquoChildren are dying in a new Glasgow hospital because the water is contaminated, perhaps by pigeon droppings. A new multi-million pound Edinburgh hospital, should have opened in , is still unfit to open. You canrsquot even get the ventilation system to work. Yoursquove got the worst drug addiction problem in Europe but you cut drug treatment budgets by pound million. You clung on to your last health minister, you are under pressure to sack her successor. Yoursquove called for legislation to protect the NHS from Donald Trump. Maybe the NHS needs legislation to protect it from Nicola Sturgeon : Sturgeon acccuses think-tank on analysisIt was a blistering inquiry. To be fair to Ms Sturgeon, she had responses for both Neil last week and her interrogators on Tuesday. To Neil, she pointed out, among other things, the pound million being put into meeting waiting time targets, the public inquiry into the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, and the ldquoextremely high public satisfaction ratings for the NHS in Scotland. In the STV debate she highlighted the improvement in reading.The question here is not how she performed in both instances. She is an impressive politician, on the national and international stage. But why does it take a General Election for her to be challenged so robustly  Why are there not more such encounters For all Andrew Neilrsquos talents, he did not fall out of a magic interviewer tree. He is smart, fast, has a certain dogged style and command of facts and puts them to good use. Similarly, there was nothing radically dferent about the STV debate, other than the participants were allowed to cross examine each other, an innovation all other televised debates should adopt.There is no doubt that the First Minister regularly puts her record forward for scrutiny. She does it every week at FMQs for starters. It should be noted, too, that like the other party leaders, but not Boris Johnson, she went into the Neil den. He has been frit she was not. Over the past few weeks she has appeared in countless debates and phone-ins.Yet as far as television grillings go, it is only in the Neil interview and the STV debate that she has been robustly held to account.Granted, the notion that Scotlandrsquos First Minister is somehow given an easy ride will be laughable to some. Of the near dozen national daily newspapers in Scotland only one, our sister paper The National, openly backs independence and, by implication, the main party supporting it.Of the rest, as any visit to the newsagents will show, no-one would suspect them of being cheerleaders for the FM, and some are ferocious in their criticism.As for the BBC in Scotland, it comes under frequent attack for alleged bias, a charge it denies.This is not solely about the media, however. It is about a political culture that has become too settled and not questioning enough.In part the failure to hold the FM and her Ministers to account can be put down to the calibre of opposition politicians. A fair number, not all, are simply not good enough. Nor is the Scottish Parliament always sitting when problems arise.: Candidate leaflet defacedI do not believe that the First Minister is given an easier time of it because she is a woman. If anything, the opposite is true.The trouble goes wider than any branch of the media, or inidual politician. A few months ago there was a dust up on Twitter between Muriel Gray and Val McDermid. The row flared over a tweet by the BBCrsquos political editor Laura Kuenssberg and whether or not it showed bias against the FM. Ms McDermid said: ldquoI used to respect you @bbclaurak. Insulting a politician for doing their job, however, reduces that respect to shreds.To which Ms Gray replied: ldquoMocking politicians of all and every party instead of beatying them used to be the norm in Scotland. We were rather good at it. The bedrock of Scots humour. Not sure I even recognise this lsquoworship the great leader or rsquo thing. Itrsquos so not ...Scottish. And so it went on.Did Gray have a point  Is there enough distance in Scotland between the government and the governed, or after so long with one party in power has the situation become cosier than is good for us Every government makes mistakes. All governments can do better. There have to be ways of pointing that out that donrsquot meet with accusations of bias or unfairness. Criticising a Scottish Government ndash of whatever stripe ndash is not criticising Scotland.

I would suggest that the Scottish Government thinks afresh about how the police service is scrutinised and held to account and how, or , a better separation between politics and policing, and indeed between the police service and those who oversee it, can be achieved. I would be pleased to share my thoughts and reflections on these matters with you, and indeed with the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Justice Committee, at any time.May I thank you for the opportunity to have served in this role and hope that our police service continues to develop effectively in the future.Kind regardsSusan Deacon CBE"},{"url":null,"title":"stop-spread-norovirus","story":"They include rapidly feeling sick, projectile vomiting and watery diarrhoea.People may also experience a high temperature, a headache and aching arms and legs.Symptoms usually clear within two days but adults and children are advised not toto work or school until  hours after symptoms have passed.:Poll: Most Scots think SNP handling NHS badlyThose affected should drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash, while they are ill and only eatthey want to, according to official NHS advice.Babies who have the bug should receive their usual feeds but possibly smaller amounts at more regular intervals.People who are sick or elderly are especially vulnerable to catching the bug, so anyone who has experienced vomiting or diarrhoea is advised to not visit elderly or poorly relatives, particularlythey are in hospital.Alcohol gels and rubs do not kill norovirus ndash the best way to stop the bug spreading is by washing hands frequently with soap and water.:Winter vomiting bug fears shuts two Scottish schoolsNorovirus can be caught by coming into close contact with an infected person and by touching surfaces or objects that have the virus on them, then touching the mouth.It is also possible to catch norovirus through eating food that has been prepared or handled by somebody with the bug.To clean the house, people are advised to use bleach and hot water or a cleaner with bleach in it.Cleaning should focus on commonly used objects such as toilets, taps, telephones, door handles and kitchen surfaces.Bedding and contaminated clothing can be washed at C to kill the bug."},{"url":null,"title":"much-polls-change-now-election-day","story":"Opinion polls continue to suggest the Conservative Party enjoys a comfortable lead over Labour.The latest poll averages put the Tories on %, with Labour on %, the Liberal Democrats on %, the Brexit Party on % and the Greens on %.But what are the chances of the polls shting decisively between now and election day At this point in the  election campaign, the polls showed the Conservatives on %, with Labour on %, the Lib Dems on %, Ukip on % and the Greens on %.:Labour accused of failing to investigate antisemitism casesBut on election day, the Tories finished on % ndash one point below where they had been a week earlier ndash while Labour had risen six points to %.The Lib Dems were still on %, while both Ukip and the Greens finished on %.The change was enough to deny the Tories a majority and produce a hung parliament.There was movement in  as well, albeit on a smaller scale and with dferent consequences.One week before polling day in , the Tories were averaging % and Labour %, with Ukip on %, the Lib Dems on % and the Greens on %.These figures pointed to a hung parliament ndash but come election day, the Tories opened up a seven-point lead over Labour to finish on % while Labour ended on %.:Jo Swinson suggests she will not work with SNP for Peoples Voteprice tag is indyrefUkip, the Lib Dems and Greens finished on %, % and % respectively.This was enough to give the Conservatives a small overall majority in Parliament.The pattern in  and  suggests that what the polls are showing one week from election day is not necessarily the best guide to what will happen on election day itself.It also serves as a reminder that polls are not predictions, merely snapshots of opinion at a certain point in time.ndash All figures quoted above are for vote shares in Great Britain"},{"url":null,"title":"clan gathering brings together support team","story":"A north-east charity held its biannual meeting in Aberdeen recently.CLAN Cancer Support board members, staff and volunteers met at CLAN House, CLAN’s head office in Aberdeen, with guests coming from as far north as Lerwick and Kirkwall as well as from Elgin, Ballater, Turrf and Crimond.The gathering, which takes place in the spring and autumn each year, gives all the people involved in bringing cancer support to clients the opportunity to share experiences, learn about new initiatives and celebrate the positive impact the charity had had on with people affected by cancer.At the event, CLAN CEO Dr Colette Backwell shared the latest CLAN news and staff and volunteers had the opportunity to ask questions of CLAN’s trustees and board members in a Question Time style event.Dr Backwell said: “We live in such a fast-paced, busy society these days, which makes it hard to engage with everyone regularly, especially with CLAN’s widespread workforce across the north-east, Moray, Orkney and Shetland. That is why it is so important for our team to come together to celebrate our successes, learn from each other and connect as an organisation.“We’re incredibly proud to have supported over , people in the last year, more than half of which were new clients. The children and families’ team provided support on over , occasions. It’s a fantastic opportunity to thank everyone who helps make this possible and to motivate everyone to continue and surpass the excellent levels of support they provide across the region.“The number of cancers being diagnosed continues to rise, and every year it is estimated that over , people in Scotland are told they have cancer. However, more people than ever are living beyond a cancer diagnosis, which places even greater need for CLAN’s wellbeing, emotional and practical support services.”CLAN Cancer Support is an independent charity which provides comfort, support and information, free of charge, for anyone, of any age, affected by any type of cancer. CLAN aims to support people to reduce anxiety, stress and to increase their ability to cope with the effects of a serious illness. CLAN supports those who have a cancer diagnosis, as well as their friends and family members.Based in Aberdeen, the charity covers the whole of north-east Scotland, Moray, Orkney and Shetland.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..!

The energy produced is enough to power an estimated , homes, but environmentalists claim biomass energy isn’t as green as it appears.Scotlands biomass sites generate enough energy to power , homes.When people think of clean energy, wind turbines and solar  often come to mind.But biomass power plants – a less well-known method of generating renewable electricity – are booming across the UK and environmental campaigners have raised doubts about their green credentials.The burning of trees or plant matter – known as plant biomass – now accounts for more than a fth of the UK’s renewable energy, second only to wind power.The number of plant biomass power plants in the UK has more than trebled in four years, from  in  to  in .Between them, they now produce enough energy to power around . million homes, analysis by the JPIMedia Data Unit has found.In Scotland, the number has quadrupled from  biomass sites in  to  by . Unlike other forms of green energy, biomass plants produce greenhouse gases. Across the country, the rise in biomass means its total greenhouse gas emissions have nearly reached the amount produced by coal. The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : amThis week#s edition of The Orcadian is now available in shops and online, here.

It is not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland will be appalled at this latest development.“Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible.#Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston slammed the SNP and said this legal action by the government-owned CalMac will lead to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.He said: “When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway. But with the SNP in sole charge of transport for more than  years, things just keep getting worse.“This is what happens when you have a nationalist government completely distracted by the constitution.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not surprisingly, the prospect of this was enough to put some people off from coming forward in the first place.“Rape Crisis Orkney and others have rightly been highlighting the need to find ways of allowing examinations to take place. To their credit, successive Justice Ministers have responded positively since I first raised concerns with them over two years ago.#Since then, a lot of work has been carried out by ious organisations and iniduals to finding solutions that work for island communities but respect the need for equal access to services.“I, therefore, welcome the Forensic Medical Services Bill and its commitment to equal access across all health boards, including our islands.  The provision of support from the Taskforce to assist with creating and enhancing facilities to allow this to happen is also reassuring.#While some iniduals may still prefer to access services where, for a iety of reasons, what is key is that this is a matter of choice.“Hopefully, NHS Orkney working with local partners will now be able to build on the progress made to date so that we have a robust and sustainable local self-referral service in line with other parts of the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While holding the poets aloft, championing them as national talents, it gives them room to breathe and write about whatever they choose.Editor Calum Rodger is Scottish Slam Poetry Champion , and this summer represented Scotland at the Poetry Slam World Cup. The signicant acievement received little media attention here – poets are not always very good at sending out press releases, and it’s a shame they even have to – but it was of little surprise to anyone who knows him. We work together on the co-operatively owned Gutter magazine. For years Rodger has been one of the best live performers on the scene, his words as rigorous as they are joyful. I have seen him coax a teetering, worse-for-wear literary crowd into awed silence by standing on a chair and reciting poetry word perfectly in his North Berwick accent. You can get a taste in a Tedx Talk on Youtube called Glasgow flourishes, where he says “Some would have it thought that Glasgow’s wrought from miracles. They’re wrong. It lives in stone, souls, song and syllables.”: Renfrewshire appoints first Makar: Former staff turn fire on Scottish Poetry Library management in wake of resignation of leading writersIn Rodger’s introduction to Makar Unmakar, small-press Tapsalteerie’s first full collection, he sketches the culture these poems come from. “Poetry is a shared enterprise, through such multarious activities as collaboration, translation, zine and small-press publishing, workshops, events, research, criticism, and pedagogy.” Coverage of what emerges from this petri dish usually concludes poetry is ‘thriving’ pegged on inidual poets or successful spoken-word events. But publishing, occasionally awkwardly, straddles both business and art and that in many ways shapes what emerges.Rhyming Texan lairdsMuch of what happens in collaborative, close-knit small-press scenes is, by nature and by economics, driven more by linguistic passion than by servicing commercial markets as first priority. Funding problems to one side, it’s where some really interesting and innovative writing is nurtured.Scottish art, wherever it is categorised, defined, or boundaried in any way, has always faced a see-saw of self-identity, balanced between thematic and physical claims to ‘Scottishness’. In some instances, definition takes the ‘by formation’ route, akin to the electoral rollyou live here, you’re in. Sometimes, Scottishness is defined more vaguely, fuzzy around the edges but usually with the aim of welcoming, encompassing being born, living, or having studied here, or writing explicitly with reference to Scottish terrain. : Wigtown Prize for Poetry won by Scots language entry for first time: Remembering the Scots poet described as the “worst in the world”‘Makar’, the old Scots word for poet, which has seen a resurgence in recent years with appointments of Edwin Morgan, Liz Lochhead, and Jackie Kay, is playfully balanced with ‘unmakar’. The book is respectful of these poets, but sceptical of the confines of formal roles. As Rodger describes it “Makars-with-a-capital-M who, like their courtly forebears, participate in public discourse from a position of governmental patronage or sponsorship. That contemporary Scotland supports such a role for poetry is a fact worth celebrating, but as with all our democratic institutions it should not be celebrated uncritically. This critical spirit is there in Morgan, Lochhead and Kay, to their great credit.” But, as the introdution continues, the idea of reducing the recognition and support of Scottish poetry to “a civic appelation” is at odds with the wide-ranging interests and inner world of any good poet, no matter where they live.Voices suppressed by poetry establishmentThe reader is reminded that a prior anthology, Twelve Modern Scottish Poets, was entirely male. Although it was published  years ago, there are more recent anthologies which, while marginally better, still skew overwhelmingly towards men, like the Zoo of the New. While the book sets itself up as an alternative, Rodger says the selection wasn’t gender-balanced by numbers. “Rather, it’s simply the case that much of the best poetry in Scotland today is being written by voices hitherto suppressed by the established hierarchies of the poetry world.” This has also played out in recent publishing start-ups who publish more ersely than predecessors because the scene they exist within is more erse. The world turns, slowly.You can feel the academic context Rodger and many of the contributors emerge from most strongly in the introductions to each poet, which attempts to situate them critically alongside the wheres and whats of previous work. As an avid reader, but one who gave up academia years ago, parsing meaning from the dense descriptors occasionally left me ready to shout Parkle. But it’s also a book which says to the reader: make of this what you will. There are no polemics here, no dumbings down.Language ranges from crisp, humourous, or direct in those with a knack for summing up a complex feeling and chasing it around their lines in an attempt to pin it down and others which venture into the unknown, making both the complexity of what’s around and their attempts to grasp it their theme. Juana Adcock, a rising star writer and translator, writes of “a feeling of being at home in the unknown”, Tessa Berringspeaks of “lean words, you know, like spirit, and lightly placed unspeakable things”.Another highlight is Daisy Lafargue who searches for signs in the world around and suggests, “to receive them, it helps to be empty but imbued with residual , like a disused water tower”. Maria Sledmore says “to exist here is ever to quiver”. Elsewhere, Harry Josephine Giles writes future fantasy in Scots and Alice Tarbuck makes mischief with Classical allusions. Their chosen forms y from straightforward to experimental, but each poet has given the reader a ining rod what we find with it depends on what direction we walk, led by our own associations.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising.

ministers were limited in what they can say, so as not to prejudice the outcome of those proceedings.However, Mr Wheelhouse said that the government remained fully committed to the provision of safe, effective and reliable ferry services to Shetland and Orkney.Mr Wheelhouse said: “Transport Scotland is liaising with the current operator, Serco Limited, to make arrangements for the extension of the current contract to maintain continuity of service and to ensure full connectivity to and from the Northern Isles.“This will mean that the local communities, passengers and businesses who rely on the services, and the staff who work on them, will not be affected by the legal proceedings and services will be run as normal throughout this period.”Mr Wheelhouse said the legal proceedings would not affect the recent commitment to fare reductions on Shetland routes for islanders, including a  per cent discount on cabin fares and a three-year fares freeze from January .Orkney MSP Liam McArthur said it was deeply disappointing that CalMac had chosen to go down this route. It was not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland would be appalled at the latest development.He said: “Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible”.Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “Procurement for the next Northern Isles ferry service contract has been hit by a number of unacceptable delays which does nothing to reassure people in the Northern Isles that the government is committed to improving our leline ferry services.“It is imperative that this dispute is resolved as soon as possible in the best interests of people in Orkney and Shetland.”Highlands and Islands Tory MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston, who lives in Orkney, also weighed in over the situation.He said: “It’s quite incredible that the SNP is being sued by oneits own quangos.“It tells you everything you need to know about the mess the SNP government has made of ferry services that a publicly owned company wants to take it to court, leading to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.“When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy.

Unusually, there has been no lull in numbers since July and the emergency department has come under sustained pressure. Its fairly relentless seven days a week, said Mr Gillespie.Mr Lavery outlined a combination of factors including an increase in out-of-area attendees, older patients, and children.Traditionally Altnagelvin ED treated around , attendees but that has surged over the past five years. The department was built to hold - patients at a time, one night last week there were  patients in attendance, and the figure regularly sits around -.The current facilities were not built to cope with the almost , patients now flowing through its doors each year, that figure is expected to rise to around , next year.The Derry News recently reported that the business case for AE expansion at Altnagelvin has reached its “final stages”. It would accommodate an anticipated , annual attendees. However, it requires funding approval and ministerial sign-off and delivery is likely to take a number of years. Pharmacy staff are taking strike action today, December , and Wednesday, December .Industrial action will put additional pressure on services throughout December, with Royal College of Nursing members taking action short of strike on December  and again on December  , then full strike action on December . “That is being managed on a daily basis and a contingency plan is in place,” Ms McKay said.She added that there has been “no additional investment” this year to deal with winter pressures from the department or health and social care board.The majority of patients attending are doing so for category   health care which is deemed “immediate very urgent”. googletag.cmd.push Statistics A newly published Department of Health report shows that in September a .% of patients arriving at Altnagelvin’s Emergency Department required treatment for “immediate” and “very urgent” health care.That is signicantly higher than any other emergency department in Northern Ireland with, for example, the Royal Victoria Hospital treating .% of patients in the same categories.All of the issues mentioned above have contributed to missed waiting time targets, in September last year .% of patients were treated within the -hour target, that fell to .% in September this year. The number of patients waiting  hours has risen from  in September  to  in the same month this year.The target to commence treatment within -hours also declined throughout July, August and September.Other hospitals have been similarly affected, for example, In September the Royal Victoria scored .% for its -hour target and there were  patients waiting over  hours. Ms McKay said the Trust’s priority is to “make sure patient care is safe and therefore whatever we need, evenpatients have to remain in the emergency department, we’ll make sure we have enough nurses to look after them and take care of them, and enough doctors to see and treat them in a timely manner. Irrespective of anything  that is our focus.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Unusually, there has been no lull in numbers since July and the emergency department has come under sustained pressure. Its fairly relentless seven days a week, said Mr Gillespie.Mr Lavery outlined a combination of factors including an increase in out-of-area attendees, older patients, and children.Traditionally Altnagelvin ED treated around , attendees but that has surged over the past five years. The department was built to hold - patients at a time, one night last week there were  patients in attendance, and the figure regularly sits around -.The current facilities were not built to cope with the almost , patients now flowing through its doors each year, that figure is expected to rise to around , next year.The Derry News recently reported that the business case for AE expansion at Altnagelvin has reached its “final stages”. It would accommodate an anticipated , annual attendees. However, it requires funding approval and ministerial sign-off and delivery is likely to take a number of years. Pharmacy staff are taking strike action today, December , and Wednesday, December .Industrial action will put additional pressure on services throughout December, with Royal College of Nursing members taking action short of strike on December  and again on December  , then full strike action on December . “That is being managed on a daily basis and a contingency plan is in place,” Ms McKay said.She added that there has been “no additional investment” this year to deal with winter pressures from the department or health and social care board.The majority of patients attending are doing so for category   health care which is deemed “immediate very urgent”. googletag.cmd.push Statistics A newly published Department of Health report shows that in September a .% of patients arriving at Altnagelvin’s Emergency Department required treatment for “immediate” and “very urgent” health care.That is signicantly higher than any other emergency department in Northern Ireland with, for example, the Royal Victoria Hospital treating .% of patients in the same categories.All of the issues mentioned above have contributed to missed waiting time targets, in September last year .% of patients were treated within the -hour target, that fell to .% in September this year. The number of patients waiting  hours has risen from  in September  to  in the same month this year.The target to commence treatment within -hours also declined throughout July, August and September.Other hospitals have been similarly affected, for example, In September the Royal Victoria scored .% for its -hour target and there were  patients waiting over  hours. Ms McKay said the Trust’s priority is to “make sure patient care is safe and therefore whatever we need, evenpatients have to remain in the emergency department, we’ll make sure we have enough nurses to look after them and take care of them, and enough doctors to see and treat them in a timely manner. Irrespective of anything  that is our focus.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He says there is a “deepening crisis” and this winter we must be prepared for “unprecedented risks” to quality of care and patient safety. He has pointed to an ageing population, delayed transfer of care, inadequate nurse staffing levels and lack of funding as contributing factors. “While often seen by many as an ED standard, waiting times such as the ‘ hour standard’ and the number of patients spending gt  hours in our EDs are better seen as barometers of the wider health and social care system pressures.“Over a third of our patients currently spend gt  hours in our EDs, with  patients spending gt  hours in our EDs in the  months from April - September  - a year on year increase of %.In the last  hours alone around  patients spent gt  hours in our EDs.“The waiting times in our EDs are virtually entirely attributable to factors out with the control of our ED teams.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs are as a result of our growing and ageing population compounded by failures in other parts of the health and social care system including access to primary care, elective care and palliative care.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs is accompanied by increasing numbers of patients requiring hospital admission and therefore beds on wards.“There is a lack of al capacity in our hospitals as a result of the reduction in the number of hospital beds by around % since   compounded by the extraordinary number of bed days lost as a result of delayed transfers of care.“A delayed transfer of care is where a patient is deemed to be medically fit to be discharged from hospital but where this cannot occur due to the lack of availability of social care, such as packages of care to support a patient in ing home, or residential or nursing home places. “The outrun of this is that bed occupancy is running at% across many of our hospital sites in core specialties such as general internal medicine and care of the elderly when the widely accepted standard is %.“Consequently, there is a lack of patient flow through our hospitals and onwards into the community, with the majority of our patients referred for hospital admission spending long periods of time in our EDs awaiting beds onwards.“When the majority, or all, of the rooms cubicles in our EDs are occupied by patients awaiting beds on wards then there is physically no appropriate space to assess further patients.“Furthermore, there are often inadequate nurse staffing levels to safely manage the clinical workload. The numbers skill mix of nursing staff may be below that required to deliver safe, effective care in a timely manner to our ED patients, let alone to do so concurrently with those patients awaiting beds on wards.“The lack of appropriate physical space and inadequate nurse staffing levels further impacts on the waiting times for those patients who are not referred for admission.“As we approach the winter months from our lowest ever baseline we must expect waiting times and the unprecedented risks to quality of care and patient safety to increase further as even more of our patients spend even longer in our even more crowded EDs.“In practical terms, it is simply impossible for our ED teams to be expected to deliver more with less year on year.“The Royal College of Emergency Medicine has consistently highlighted the deepening crisis in our EDs over time.“Seeking to do things dferently or more efficiently will not offset the need for corrective investment to increase staffing, the number of acute hospital beds and the social care that are fundamentally required.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He has pointed to an ageing population, delayed transfer of care, inadequate nurse staffing levels and lack of funding as contributing factors. “While often seen by many as an ED standard, waiting times such as the ‘ hour standard’ and the number of patients spending gt  hours in our EDs are better seen as barometers of the wider health and social care system pressures.“Over a third of our patients currently spend gt  hours in our EDs, with  patients spending gt  hours in our EDs in the  months from April - September  - a year on year increase of %.In the last  hours alone around  patients spent gt  hours in our EDs.“The waiting times in our EDs are virtually entirely attributable to factors out with the control of our ED teams.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs are as a result of our growing and ageing population compounded by failures in other parts of the health and social care system including access to primary care, elective care and palliative care.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs is accompanied by increasing numbers of patients requiring hospital admission and therefore beds on wards.“There is a lack of al capacity in our hospitals as a result of the reduction in the number of hospital beds by around % since   compounded by the extraordinary number of bed days lost as a result of delayed transfers of care.“A delayed transfer of care is where a patient is deemed to be medically fit to be discharged from hospital but where this cannot occur due to the lack of availability of social care, such as packages of care to support a patient in ing home, or residential or nursing home places. “The outrun of this is that bed occupancy is running at% across many of our hospital sites in core specialties such as general internal medicine and care of the elderly when the widely accepted standard is %.“Consequently, there is a lack of patient flow through our hospitals and onwards into the community, with the majority of our patients referred for hospital admission spending long periods of time in our EDs awaiting beds onwards.“When the majority, or all, of the rooms cubicles in our EDs are occupied by patients awaiting beds on wards then there is physically no appropriate space to assess further patients.“Furthermore, there are often inadequate nurse staffing levels to safely manage the clinical workload. The numbers skill mix of nursing staff may be below that required to deliver safe, effective care in a timely manner to our ED patients, let alone to do so concurrently with those patients awaiting beds on wards.“The lack of appropriate physical space and inadequate nurse staffing levels further impacts on the waiting times for those patients who are not referred for admission.“As we approach the winter months from our lowest ever baseline we must expect waiting times and the unprecedented risks to quality of care and patient safety to increase further as even more of our patients spend even longer in our even more crowded EDs.“In practical terms, it is simply impossible for our ED teams to be expected to deliver more with less year on year.“The Royal College of Emergency Medicine has consistently highlighted the deepening crisis in our EDs over time.“Seeking to do things dferently or more efficiently will not offset the need for corrective investment to increase staffing, the number of acute hospital beds and the social care that are fundamentally required.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Whilst they did come from behind to eventually win, they could well have made the game safe, even before half time, such was their dominance in possession, but their decision making when it mattered cost them several points and allowed Bangor to remain in the game right to the last. City of Derry were left grateful that Bangor missed what would have been a game winning penalty from m with just three minutes to go, but ultimately this was a deserved victory for the visitors who now have that poor away record off their backs. googletag.cmd.push Early scoreDerry started well on Saturday and got their reward in the opening minutes as full-back David Graham touched down in the corner and with McDonnell converting, the visitors had a - lead.Rather than build on that however, Derry found themselves on the back foot and they conceded within minutes as their lead quickly disappeared – second row Declan Horrix crashing over and with Rhys Larmour converting the game was tied at -.From a strong early lead, Derry then found themsleves chasing the game as Bangor built on that momentum to score a second try - Ally Lockhart feeding Jamie Clegg who released Mark Widdowson to score in the corner. Larmour again converted and Derry were chasing the game at -.The score stayed that way into half time, which was bizarre given the dominance of Derry for the majority of the half – the visitors dominated possession and territory but were guilty of too many unforced errors in the Bangor , with a missed penalty just before the break also not helping matters, the ball striking the post to keeping Bangor ahead.Derry continued to apply pressure in the early stages of the second half and that eventually told as they finally got their second try – Stephen Corr scoring, but a missed conversion meant that they still trailed by two points.A penalty by McDonnell minutes later put the visitors back into the lead however and with less than  minutes on the clock it was Derrys to lose. They continued to dominate but couldnt add to their tally and that could have cost them as they conceded a scorable penalty with three minutes left on the clock – Larmour stepped up to win the game but his effort was off target, much to the relief of the Derry players, who had done more than enough to win this game in the  minutes previous. googletag.cmd.push City of Derry: J Hamilton, R Harkin, S Duffy, G Doherty, Q Warmerdam, S Corr, T Thorton, R Baird, M Rankin, A McDonnell, T Cole, D Posternak, D Lapsley, C OHagan, D Graham.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Bungalow.jpg","title":"Bungalow with an island a snip at just £12m  ","story":"A PRESTIGIOUS house near Downpatrick with its own stunning island is on the market.On offer for a cool pound.m, the four-bedroom home is located in a little piece of paradise overlooking Strangford Lough.Castle Island is a private island extending to around  acres along with almost two miles of shoreline, nestling at the mouth of the Quoile River.Laid out over a single storey with contemporary living in mind, the principal reception rooms and bedroom accommodation are well-positioned to benefit from the magnicent views towards the Mournes, while a sunroom provides access to the terrace which benefits from sunlight throughout the day.The master bedroom suite has dual-aspect feature windows overlooking the mountains and River Quoile, the latter created in the th century when Edward Southwell, landlord of Downpatrick, built a tidal barrier at the Quoile and began draining the land to create over  acres from the western edge of Strangford Lough.Features of the house include double glazing, a decorative fireplace in the drawing room and a wood-burning stove with brick surround in the sitting room. The property also benefits from an integral garage.A key feature of the island is the direct road access to the mainland via Castle Island Road and onto Strangford Road which connects Strangford with Downpatrick.The new owners will share the island with Quoile Yacht Club, which offers some of the finest facilities in Strangford Lough, and the Quoile Pondage Nature Reserve and Bird Hide.The enclosed garden and grounds at the house extend to . acres and slope from the house to Castle Island Road and include manicured lawns and mature trees which provide shelter and amenity. There is also a small gravel area next to the house with trees and shrubs.An extensive block of farmland lies within a perimeter fence and is well suited for the grazing of livestock and production of silage hay.Estate agents Osborne King say that while nestled in private surroundings, the island conveniently lies a short distance from several towns including Downpatrick.While there is an abundance of amenities on the island including wildle, and sporting opportunities, there are also plenty of interest points nearby, including Castle Ward and Delamont Country Park.Gavin Clarke, from Osborne King, says the property has been on the market for over a week and is already generating interest from potential buyers.ldquoThis delightful property would make an ideal second home or, alternatively, a main family residence, given its tranquil location and magnicent views, with the Mournes to one side and Strangford on the other, he said.ldquoThe current owners have lived there for around  years and while they are very sorry to see it go, they look forward to seeing others benefit from it. The bungalow is ready to walk into as it has been well maintained down through the years.Gavin added: ldquoWith a couple of viewings in the pipeline, it would be nice to sell this side of Christmas.Further information is available from the Osborne King office, Donegal Square South, Belfast on    or email property@osborneking..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Businesswoman.jpg","title":"Businesswomen mentor Assumption students  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH students have taken part in their first management programme that promotes womenrsquos capacity for leadership.Over  sixth form girls at Assumption Grammar School spent the day recently shadowing female leaders in a range of industries including financial services, recruitment, law, media, construction and health, last month.SistersIN Female Leadership Programme, was launched this year to help foster girlsrsquo confidence in leadership roles.Organisers say it gave those taking part an opportunity to work alongside a female mentor at CEO, director or partner level across several trades in which women continue to be underrepresented at the top.Projects and communications assistant Hannah Magorrian said: ldquoAfter spending the day with mentors, the students develop their leadership skills in school, leading initiatives including mental health, peer mentoring, photography, sport, music, drama, debating, literacy, creative writing, religion and coding.ldquoThe school hopes these pupil-led initiatives will provide a legacy that benefits the whole school and wider community.ldquoIn line with the ethos at the heart of Assumption Grammar School, the pupils have already spent time with female leaders in local charities.She continued: ldquoThe school is currently working with its sister Assumption schools in South Africa to develop a parallel initiative with the aim of empowering African girls to become future leaders.ldquoThis global aspect of the SistersIN programme is reaching out to a country where females are vastly underrepresented at senior management and executive levels.The SistersIN Female Leadership Programme is being piloted in Assumption Grammar School this year, in association with Women in Business.Pupils will have two further leadership experience days, working with female leaders, on February  and June  when they will gain a dferent experience of leadership from one of over  partner industries..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Celebration.jpg","title":"Celebration time for Aughlisnafin  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN GAC held their annual presentations and dinner in the Burrendale Hotel last Saturday evening with Armagh and Crossmaglen Rangers legend Oisin McConville as the special guest.Major awards were as follows: seniors mdash managerrsquos player of the year, Donagh Steele managerrsquos sportsperson, Sean Fitzsimmons playersrsquo player, Donagh Steele.Minors mdash managerrsquos player, Morgan Croskery managerrsquos sportsperson, Peter OrsquoHare playersrsquo player, Ben Ogle.Senior players Oran Flanagan and Oisin OrsquoToole, received a commemorative league winners shield, on behalf of the squad, which has the names of every player and the management team engraved on it.The senior  and management team were also presented with league and championship medals and the minors were presented with their All County league medals.There were two recipients of the club person of the year award mdash chairperson Sheena Murray in recognition of an outstanding first term in her role and also Gerard Lenaghan in his role as coaching officer and PRO.The final award of the evening was presented to club vice-chairperson and senior player Rory Murphy in recognition of his outstanding contribution over the past  years.Oisin McConville was then invited to say a few words and spoke well with excellent advice for the future and encouraging rank and file members to put their shoulders to the wheel.There is much to do in a growing club and help is vital to sustain the clubrsquos development.

Many from Kilmegan and the surrounding areas tragically paid the ultimate price on a foreign field and are remembered in the book.Chapters on the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, the Troubles, the loyalist and IRA ceasefires and the Good Friday Agreement take the history of the parish into the modern age.Hundreds of hours of painstaking work researching historical documents and the archives of local newspapers, including those of the Down Recorder, were involved in the production of this book which will undoubtedly be regarded as an important point of reference for current and future generations.In a typically noble and generous gesture the Kilmegan and Maghera Historical Group have decided proceeds from the sale of the book will go to the Childrenrsquos Heartbeat Trust.Copies are now on sale at Walkersrsquo newsagents and JRrsquos Discount Stores, Castlewellan, with details of further points of sale on the Grouprsquos Facebook page, Kilmegan Maghera..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Lecale.jpg","title":"Lecale and Downe Historical Society launches annual publication  ","story":"THE Lecale and Downe Historical Society launched its th annual journal at the Down County Museum last week.Lecale Review No , has proved to be another excellent mix of compelling articles of local interest, published just in time for Christmas.The latest annual charters the history of one of the oldest racecourses in the world outside Downpatrick.The story penned by Joan Magee, lsquoHorse Racing At the Flying Horsersquo tells how a handful of gentry held a horse race around  but little  is known of the occasion.Within  years, the Earl of Ardglass and other noblemen petitioned King James II to set up a Royal Corporation of Horse Breeders within the county.All its members were to be known as Freemen and it had the power to meet in Downpatrick or some other Co Down town every Tuesday of Easter week.As well as having permission to race, the corporation was also permitted to hold a horse fair too.Joan explains that a race transpired at the Flying Horse, Downpatrick, on March ,  and is especially signicant as this race marked the beginning of what is one of the earliest flat racing courses in the world.The winner was Colonel Byerley, who fought at the Battle of the Boyne four months later against the platersquos donor ndash King James II.Another interesting article written by Colm Rooney charts the history of cinema within Downpatrick.Colm reveals that while Belfast had over two dozen cinemas, Downpatrick finally welcomed its first, the Pavilion Picture Theatre in St Patrickrsquos Avenue, at a glitzy opening ceremony on Wednesday June , .It was a huge event for local entrepreneur, Downpatrick man, William Tweedie who watched as locals queued up to pay over one shilling to see the Prisoner of Zenda, the first movie ever shown in the cinema.The cinema later moved to Market Street in the early s with the Breen family taking over the running of the business around , which ran until the s.Another article, Downpatrick by Gaslight, written by Andy Gilmore, reflects on the journey of natural gas over the centuries in Downpatrick.Andy points out that the use of town gas in Ireland dates back to  when gas for lighting streets and homes began to be produced from coal.However, it wasnrsquot until , and a concerted effort by the townsfolk that led to the foundation of a gas company that brought the energy source to Downpatrick.A site on Market Street was agreed for the gasworks in  and it opened later that year.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour. Itrsquos something Irsquove never seen before, said the councillor whose home overlooks the harbour.ldquoI am glad that the boat has finally been lted and taken away for everyonersquos benefit and safety..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Success.jpg","title":"Success of Saintfield community centre can drive support  ","story":"THE stunning success of Saintfieldrsquos new community centre is spearheading the drive for other available space at the Belfast Road site to be used by local people.It was revealed this week that bookings for the new centre mdash delivered by the Saintfield Development Association with the help of Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash are already ahead of projected targets.Association officials are also quietly confident that the financial sustainability of the community-run centre seems assured, with the priority for the future ensuring that the needs of local people are catered for, including classes, activities and interests for a wide range of organisations.Currently, there is a focus on developing youth provision and support for first time parents. It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/buil1.jpg","title":"nine storey office scheme for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew A new proposed nine-storey office building in the heart of Belfast city centre could house up to  workers once completed, Ulster Business can reveal. There are now plans to build the grade A office building at Victoria Street. It would see the current Chancery House building knocked down to make way for the development. In , the building was sold off in excess of its guide price of £.m following a competitive bidding process. Chancery House, which is located on the edge of Belfast’s Law Courts and opposite Victoria Square Shopping Centre, was purchased by a local private developer. The fresh planning application has been made by Chancery House Investments Ltd, which includes Northern Ireland businessman Darren Donnelly as a director. Its being designed by Todd Architects alongside planning consultancy Turley. The building would include more than , sq ft of grade A office space, and those behind it have said it “would assist in addressing an identied need in the marketplace for small office floor plates to primarily serve indigenous businesses which are expanding and want a city centre business location”. It also says the design of the development “has been carefully formulated and responds to the immediate context of the site and its surrounding”. “The proposals improve the setting of the Old Town Hall and define its location with a building which adds vibrancy to this important nodal point”. A design statement says the development could accommodate between - office workers. Speaking at the time of the sale of Chancery House, Neil McShane, director at Lambert Smith Hampton, who the sale process, said: “Chancery House represented a unique opportunity in that it is an income-producing investment property with exciting development prospects. The prime location and secure tenant means that it will continue to perform well as an office investment but,redeveloped, will attract signicant interest from potential occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
