Photograph: Brian LawlessPAA trainee nurse who has been reinterpreting art masterpieces to tell the story of the Covid-19 pandemic has painted the “Corona Lisa” to raise money for charity.The striking piece by Chloe Slevin has Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa dressed in full personal protective equipment (PPE) used by healthcare workers.The 21-year-old artist, also a third-year nursing student at University College Dublin, is auctioning the painting to raise funds for children’s hospice LauraLynn. She drew inspiration from her experiences during a recent placement on a children’s emergency ward.“The PPE became normal to us and we were wearing it day in, day out, and that’s kind of what inspired the Corona Lisa,” she said.“I loved this placement but it was a very tough time. There I experienced my first paediatric cardiac arrest and that’s something you’d never forget. You never forget the moment you got that phone call, we ran in to put on our PPE and we did everything we could.“It was probably the toughest thing I’ve gone through so far, it was an incredibly difficult time. The impact it had on me, I still get emotional talking about it today. With this painting, I was able to turn to this and use that as my own form of art therapy and a distraction.”Ms Slevin said the painting “holds a special place for me now because of where it came” from, and that it illustrates what many healthcare staff have been through during the pandemic.“You’re smothered in PPE and it’s tough. It was a very tough placement but I hope to one day get a job there. That’s my dream to work in an emergency department,” she said.The Corona Lisa is the latest famous artwork the Dublin student has recreated with a Covid-19 twist.Earlier in the pandemic she painted the outstretched hands in Michelangelo’s The Creation Of Adam wearing surgical gloves, entitled The Separation of Adam. That raised €520 for the children’s ambulance service Bumbleance.She also created the Girl With A Surgical Mask in a nod to Johannes Vermeer’s Girl With A Pearl Earring. That raised €400 for the Feed the Heroes charity, which delivered food to hospital and emergency workers during the height of the pandemic.Ms Slevin said she has learned a lot about the palliative care offered to children at LauraLynn during her course, including art therapy, and she wants to support its work.“They’re such an important charity and the work they do for these families is amazing, so I really want to put this one out there for them,” she said.Cathy White, a community fundraising executive at LauraLynn, said art plays an important role in the hospice’s mission to help create memories for families.“One of the things we always say is that we can’t add days into a child’s life but we can make those days mean more, and we can help families create memories,” she said.“Art is so important and it really gives our children, especially those who might be non-verbal, the chance to communicate.”An online auction for the Corona Lisa will be run on the website of auctioneer Herman \u0026amp Wilkinson from 10am on January 31st. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid endgame the writing was on the wall for the last week","story":"The late shift medical staff at St Vincent’s hospital, Dublin,  don PPE in the clean zone on the Covid side of the Emergency Department in April 2020.

It is one of the priority prices of legislation, which will be prioritised in this first two sessions of the Dáil.”Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Saturday with Katie Hannon, Minister Rabbitte said that she is anxious to see legislation in relation to remote working pass, as it can improve work life balance and also create more work opportunities for people with a disabilities.Sinn Féin TD, David Cullinane, said if there is government and opposition consensus on the issue, the legislation should pass quickly. “This is about choice.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"from kabul to wicklow when we arrived in ireland we felt so happy","story":"Two members of Ascend Athletics, who moved from Afghanistan to Co Wicklow after the Taliban took over the country, taking a walk by the sea at Wicklow harbour: ‘I’ve never seen the sea before I came to Ireland.’ Photograph: Jade WilsonBefore the Taliban captured Kabul and took over Afghanistan last year, a group of Afghan women who met through an athletics programme never imagined they would end up being housed by nuns in an Irish town.Twenty refugee visas were granted for the group of athletes and their dependants in September following a lobbying campaign by Galway native Anne McNamara and Dublin-based solicitor Andrea Martin.Speaking over a traditional Afghan lunch in their new home, a 20-year-old woman, who does not wish to be named as she fears for her family’s safety in Afghanistan, said life in Ireland has been good so far.“People here are so kind to us, and Wicklow is a pretty town,” she said. “But I never imagined I’d leave my country in this way. I sometimes searched online about studying abroad someday, but I didn’t imagine having to escape and come to Ireland.”The women are all members of Ascend Athletics, a programme that has been developing Afghan girls’ physical fitness and providing community leadership training since 2014. The women’s achievements were the subject of a documentary shown in Europe, and they were deemed vulnerable to Taliban persecution as a result.“At least we know each other. We learned to work together as a group with Ascend, and now we have learned to live as a group,” the woman said.Some of the women are also more vulnerable because they are Hazaras, part of the country’s Shia minority, which is highly persecuted by the Sunni Taliban. The ethnic group faced intense persecution during Afghanistan’s previous rule by the Taliban.Ten of those who arrived were resettled in Galway, and 10 went to Wicklow, where they were initially housed by Derrybawn Mountain Ecolabs in Glendalough before moving to a building owned by the Dominican Sisters in November.Every Saturday, the women go on an outing and they have recently started going to a gym and taking swimming lessons.“I’ve never seen the sea before I came to Ireland, and I’d like to swim in the sea,” another woman told The . “We have had a lot of difficulties, but when we arrived in Ireland, we felt so happy.”‘Everything was taken’But she misses her studies and wants to finish her bachelor’s in chemistry before doing a master’s degree so she can teach at a university. “I was working so hard, and everything was taken from me so suddenly.”All of the Ascend women are eager to return to education. Among them are a computer science student who was in her first year of university, a third-year chemistry student, a midwifery student and a recent high-school graduate who was hoping to begin a foundation-year course.“The day the Taliban took Kabul, I was at university, on my way to maths class. A girl was crying, telling everybody to go home. I’ll never forget it. We couldn’t join maths class after that, and my family kept calling me, telling me to come home right away. I left and never went back,” one woman said.Ms Martin has set up a community support organisation, Friends of Ascend, to support the Wicklow group during their resettlement in Ireland.It is a “long-term project”, she said, with an aim of supporting the women’s return to education, into employment and finding their own accommodation. So far, people have offered gym memberships, swimming lessons, clothes and housing support, which Ms Martin said was a “testament to the generosity of Irish people”.“Without the kindness and support of the Dominican Sisters, none of this would have been possible,” she added.A team of volunteers have been helping the group, with a focus on improving their English so they can take their studies back up. They go for sunrise walks every morning, have communal breakfast together, and three of the teenage girls have just started school at the Dominican College.Families left behind“They’ve had to leave everything behind. They’re extremely worried about their families back home. But they are so strong and they keep as busy and involved as possible,” said Julie, who is one of the volunteers.They are in touch with their families back home, though “not every day, because the internet, like everything, is so expensive there”, one of the women explained.“It is a really cold winter there now, and they are all at home, so depressed. My little sisters have no hope of starting school or university in the spring.”She added: “Right now, in Afghanistan, the rich families have a choice to leave. But we are not from rich families. We are worried about our families all the time.“Of course, we hope the situation in Afghanistan improves. We cannot rescue the whole of Afghanistan, but we have to at least try for our families.

Photograph:  Colin KeeganCollinsCovid-19 cases were towards the most pessimistic projections during the Omicron wave of the pandemic but serious clinical outcomes were “much less than expected”, the Chief Medical Officer has said.In his letter to the Government recommending the lifting of all restrictions, Dr Tony Holohan said there was “clear evidence” nationally and internationally that the variant is associated with a “significantly reduced population level of severe disease despite continuing high levels of transmission”.Omicron, which emerged in December, now accounts for 97 per cent of all Covid-19 infections in Ireland and has led to record numbers of cases.However, Dr Holohan observed that the “overall epidemiological position is improving, and the most recent data indicates that we have now passed a peak in this wave of infection”.UnderestimationThere were 375,000 PCR confirmed cases between December 30th and January 19th and 25,635 positive antigen tests uploaded to the HSE system, but even the 400,000 cases were a vast underestimation of the numbers infected.Dr Holohan said at the peak of infections there were two to three times as many cases as was reported. This would equate to between 800,000 and 1.2 million people being infected with Omicron recently.But hospital admissions of people with Covid-19 remained stable, peaking at 1,063 on January 10th and then falling below 900 as the average number of newly confirmed cases fell.Despite record case numbers, the number of patients in intensive care (ICU) peaked at 126 on November 23rd before the Omicron surge and fell to 73 on January 18th. Approximately half of confirmed cases in ICU are unvaccinated.Transmission opportunitiesCase numbers are decreasing at an average of 6 per cent per day at present, but Dr Holohan anticipated that they may rise again.“As case numbers and numbers in hospital decline and the threat recedes, population mobility and social contact will increase, creating additional opportunities for viral transmission, a process which may be accelerated by an increase in social contacts following the relaxation of restrictions. Infections and detected cases may then stabilise or start to increase,” he wrote.However, Dr Holohan said the level of immunity in the community as a result of infection and the booster vaccination programme should ensure that rising case numbers will not result in a high levels of “serious disease or an unsustainable demand on healthcare”.In addition to recommending the lifting of almost all restrictions, Nphet stated that there is no longer any justification for a curtailment of health services such as community day services.Nphet will review the impact of the lifting of restrictions on February 17th.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"irish chief of staff meets russian ambassador to discuss defence issues","story":"Russian ambassador to Ireland Yury Filatov. File image: Dara Mac DonaillThe The Russian ambassador to Ireland Yury Filatov and the Chief of Defence Staff Lieut Gen Seán Clancy have met to discuss armed contacts between the two countries.The meeting took place on Friday at the Russian embassy in Orwell Road, Dublin.It was announced in a tweet from the embassy on Friday evening: “On January 21 the Ambassador of #Russia to #Ireland Y.Filatov met with the Member of the Chief of Defence Staff of Ireland S.Clancy.“Parties discussed the issues of Russia-Ireland relations and international agenda, as well as prospects of contacts between (the) armed forces of (the) two countries.”In response the Department of Defence said the meeting was a “routine courtesy call”.A spokeswoman added: “As the recently appointed Chief of Staff, it is normal for foreign ambassadors to pay routine courtesy calls. This is one of a series of meetings. Such meetings are a matter for the chief of staff, not the minister. There is no ongoing military cooperation with Russia and there is no intention to do so.”A spokesman for the Minister for Defence Simon Coveney has not responded yet to the tweet.Live fire exerciseIndependent TD Cathal Berry said he believed the meeting has to do with a proposed naval exercise that the Russian navy intends to undertake in February.The live firing exercise will happen 240km off the Irish coast outside Irish territorial waters, but within the Irish exclusive economic zone (EEZ).The Irish Aviation Authority has sent a notification to air traffic control in Ireland stating that the live firing exercises will take place between February 3rd and 8th and between 5am and 3pm on those days. The area in question is off the southwest coast.The IAA states that “pursuant to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)annexs 11,15 and for safety of air traffic in the area you are kindly requested to issue international notam (a notice to airmen) to temporarily close above area for flights from surface to 11,000 metres”.Dr Berry, a former army ranger, said the live firing exercise, while being legal, is a “warning to Ireland that we are military weak”.He believed it was designed as an international provocation as it is close to flight paths and underwater submarine cables.The Irish talks took place while negotiations ended between Russia and the United States in Geneva without agreement.There are fears that Russia will invade Ukraine after Moscow massed tens of thousands of troops at the border, while the west has ramped up supplies of weapons to Kyiv.US secretary of state Antony Blinken and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov met for about 90 minutes in Geneva at what the American diplomat said was a “critical moment”. Expectations had been low going in, and there was no breakthrough.Mr Blinken told Mr Lavrov the US would give Russia written responses to Moscow’s proposals next week, and suggested the two would likely meet again shortly after that – offering some hope that any invasion would be delayed for at least a few more days.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"people bereaved by covid 19 feel sense of hope as restrictions removed","story":"Families are hoping to have a chance to properly come together and remember loved ones lost to Covid-19 now the majority of pandemic restrictions have been lifted.

She couldn’t travel for the funeral and it was my mother’s wish to be buried in Tipperary,” Ms Kennedy said.“It was my sister’s wish for us to wait and not do that until she came. The reopening would give us a sense of hope in that she can travel in July, we’re hoping, and that we will be able to bury our mother’s ashes.“On a rather sad note, my other sister has since passed away, she had very sudden cancer so she did not get that closure.”‘A lot of fear’Ms Kennedy said she and her family felt much sadness that her mother “died alone” in hospital.“She did die in excellent care but there was a lot of fear at the time, there was a sense of not even the hospitals at the time not really knowing the correct thing to do.It was a time of great fear for us,” she said.Ms Kennedy added that she believed it was time to move on and would be “very guided” by public health officials’ advice.“They don’t have a vested interest, they have the interest of the public at heart. They don’t have a commercial or a political slant…I would respect that if they’re saying that it’s time to move on, well then I would respect that,” she said.Bernadette Carley lost her father Stephen Byrne (93) to Covid-19 on April 19th, 2020. Her mother, Maura, could not attend the funeral as she was recovering from the disease in hospital at the time. Mrs Byrne subsequently died in November aged 96.Ms Carley said everyone was “tired and weary” due to the effects of the pandemic, adding that “it’s time to go back to normal”.“We do need to move on. I hope all the restrictions for nursing home visits are eased up, I hope they will open them up if it’s safe to do so,” she said.“The no visiting has been hard on people.

Photograph: Chris McAndrewUK ParliamentPA WireBritish prime minister Boris Johnson is facing calls for an inquiry after a Tory MP said she was told that she was sacked from her ministerial post because her Muslim faith was “making colleagues uncomfortable”.Nusrat Ghani said when she lost her job as a transport minister in 2020, a UK government whip told her “Muslimness” had been raised as an issue at a Downing Street meeting to discuss the reshuffle.Her explosive claim in an interview with the Sunday Times brought immediate condemnation from Conservative MPs and opposition parties alike, with demands for an inquiry.British education secretary Nadhim Zahawi said there was no place for Islamophobia or any form of racism in the party, and that her allegations must be “investigated properly and racism routed out”.But in a dramatic move, chief whip Mark Spencer said that he was the inidual who spoke to Ms Ghani – although he strongly denied using the words claimed.“To ensure other whips are not drawn into this matter, I am identifying myself as the person Nusrat Ghani MP has made claims about this evening,” he said in a statement posted on Twitter. “These accusations are completely false and I consider them to be defamatory. I have never used those words attributed to me.”The row erupted at the start of a crucial week for Mr Johnson, with Sue Gray, the senior civil servant investigating lockdown parties in Downing Street, expected to deliver her report.The conduct of the whips’ office has come under intense scrutiny following claims that tactics amounting to blackmail were used to pressurise Tory MPs seeking to oust the prime minister.In her interview, Ms Ghani, the MP for Wealden, said she was shocked when the issue of her background and faith was raised during a meeting in the whips’ office after the mini-reshuffle in February 2020.‘Powerless’“It was like being punched in the stomach. I felt humiliated and powerless,” she told the paper.“I was told that at the reshuffle meeting in Downing Street that ‘Muslimness’ was raised as an ‘issue’, that my ‘Muslim women minister’ status was making colleagues uncomfortable and that there were concerns ‘that I wasn’t loyal to the party as I didn’t do enough to defend the party against Islamophobia allegations’.“It was very clear to me that the whips and No 10 were holding me to a higher threshold of loyalty than others because of my background and faith.“In the following weeks, I was informed that if I persisted in raising this that I would be ostracised by colleagues and my career and reputation would be destroyed.”Mr Zahawi said it was essential that Ms Ghani’s claims were now properly addressed by the party. “There is no place for Islamophobia or any form of racism in our Conservative Party,” he tweeted.“Nus Ghani is a friend, a colleague and a brilliant parliamentarian. This has to be investigated properly and racism routed out. #standwithNus.”The senior Tory who first raised the issue of the conduct of the whip’s office, William Wragg – the chairman of the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee – also voiced his support for Ms Ghani.“Nus is very brave to speak out. I was truly appalled to learn of her experience. She shows such strength and integrity supporting others,” he tweeted.Mr Wragg is due to discuss his concerns – including claims whips threatened to withhold public funding from the constituencies of MPs calling for Mr Johnson to resign – with a Scotland Yard detective this week.Party inquiryIn a further blow to the prime minister, the Sunday Times reported Ms Gray has now widened her inquiry to include allegations that parties were held in his Downing Street flat.The paper said that two aides, Henry Newman and Josh Grimstone – both said to be friends of Mr Johnson’s wife, Carrie – visited the flat over No 11 on numerous occasions during lockdown.Initially Ms Gray was said to have accepted the visits were for work purposes, however, investigators were reported to have questioned why they were spending so much time in Downing Street when they were working for the cabinet office.Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said there was a “rotten culture” at the hear of government and that Mr Johnson and Tory chairman Oliver Dowden must launch an urgent investigation into Ms Ghani’s allegations.“This is just the latest allegation in a long list of appalling behaviour at the centre of government that the prime minister appears willing to overlook,” she said.“This rotten culture starts at the top – the lack of respect in No 10 is embarrassing our country and letting people down.”A spokesman on behalf of the whip’s office said: “These claims are categorically untrue. Ministerial roles are appointed on merit and rewards for hard work. The Conservative Party does not tolerate any form of racism or discrimination.” – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"In one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"industrialist sir richard arkwright profited slave trade says","story":"The “Father of the Factory System” contributed to the slave trade, according to English Heritage in biographical information updated following the Black Lives Matter protests.The legacy of Sir Richard Arkwright, the British inventor credited with pioneering factory production in the 18th century, has been reassessed due to his profiting from the cotton trade during the Industrial Revolution.English Heritage has included claims that the mill owner benefited from a system which “exploited enslaved workers from Africa”, in updated online information for his blue plaque.The update, made as part of a review of blue plaques launched in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, has drawn criticism from historians concerned that history is being viewed only through the lens of the slave trade, and that ordinary workers could also be found guilty by association with a cotton industry that was supported by slavery.New online information stated: “Arkwright’s wealth from the cotton industry was inextricably linked to the transatlantic slave trade which reached its peak in the 18th century. The system exploited enslaved workers from Africa to work under horrifying conditions in the cotton plantations in the Americas.The information has been added to an online entry on Sir Richard’s blue plaque, of which the physical version is installed at 8 Adam Street, central London, where he lived in his final years before his death in 1792.In the 1770s, Sir Richard developed a “carding” machine which sped up the process prior to spinning, along with spinning frames speeding up the process of turning cotton fibre into workable yarn.He used these machines in a string of mills, including a major complex in Cromford, Derbyshire, where his creation of a disciplined working day of 13-hour shifts, involving mechanised manufacturing, led to him being nicknamed the “Father of the Factory System”.However, the factory system was criticised at the time, especially for making use of child labour, which made up a large proportion of Sir Richard’s workforce, and for subjecting workers to dangerous and inhumane conditions.Concerns have been raised that English Heritage’s update on Sir Richard, which ties him to the slave trade, could also attach to guilt to factory workers who indirectly benefited from the cotton trade by working in his mills.Prof Robert Tombs, a historian at the University of Cambridge, said: “Richard Arkwright, a working-class man who invented a machine for spinning cotton, is apparently being blamed for slavery, because most cotton was grown by slaves. So presumably workers in cotton mills, their dependents, and all their customers are also responsible.“By this logic, everybody was to blame – which is perhaps the best conclusion, as slavery and other forms of coerced labour were part of the world economy for millennia, and created much of what we now consider ‘world heritage’.”Prof Neil Biggar, a theology expert at the University of Oxford, has criticised the viewing of Sir Richard’s legacy purely through the lens of slavery, calling it a “politically biased, monomaniacal focus”.Dr Zareer Masani, a historian on British colonialism, said: “Reducing all history to that of slavery and then tracing links to it, however tenuous, of most people of influence, especially in the 18th century, has become a popular pastime with our new arbiters of taste since Black Lives Matter.”He added that this analysis misses the “ills of factory labour far closer to home”.English Heritage has been contacted for comment.More from NewsJacinda Ardern postpones own wedding after introducing new Covid restrictionsFull list of Tories calling for Boris Johnson to resign - and those still backing the PMRussia accuses Britain of spreading \u0026#39nonsense\u0026#39 about plan to install puppet government in UkraineNusrat Ghani urged by Boris Johnson to make formal complaint over claim her \u0026#39Muslimness\u0026#39 was an issueKyiv compares German admiral to \u0026#39a Nazi occupier\u0026#39 after he said Putin needs \u0026#39respect\u0026#39Weak institutions are giving in to the identity politics thought policeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside number 10 defectors club","story":"There are two words to describe what it feels like to cross the floor of the House of Commons according to defector Shaun Woodward: “Relief – and that it’s ghastly.”A little over two decades before Bury South MP Christian Wakeford jumped ship from the Conservative Party to Labour last week, Mr Woodward made the same journey, a process he found both more painful than he could have imagined and, in hindsight, always inevitable. Woodward quit after the Tory leadership under William (now Lord) Hague opposed plans to repeal Section 28, the rule prohibiting the “promotion” of homosexuality in public arenas including schools. Wakeford, a 37-year-old former insurance broker, who was elected as Conservative MP for Derby South in 2019, made his dramatic departure declaring Boris Johnson and his party incapable of providing leadership in the wake of the furore over parties at No 10.Whatever the motivation, nearly all those in the small defectors’ club of MPs say they have no regrets about breaking the ultimate political taboo.Westminster might love the drama of an MP crossing the floor, but what is the human impact on the “traitors” who abandon their tribe – and on the morale of those left behind? Can they ever find a home among politicians and activists who once saw them as the enemy, or are they always viewed with suspicion? Wakeford himself has said the decision to abandon Johnson’s party for that of Sir Keir Starmer was the most difficult of his life. Clearly shaken by the experience, he admitted to sleepless nights and stumbled over his new leader’s name in his first public event as a Labour MP, momentarily giving the impression he was now serving “Keir Llama”. For Woodward too, the decision was a traumatic one – “seismic,” he says - with his departure accelerated, as, allegedly, with Wakeford, by the Whips’ Office attempting to blackmail him into toeing the line.  “I just thought – this is horrible this is not why I came into politics. So I reached out to friends in the Labour Party and said: ‘I don’t think I am going to stay in the Conservative Party.’”“I am very conscious of the people I hurt. But I didn’t go because I would be well received, I went because I couldn’t possibly stay.”Baroness Nicholson, who as Emma Nicholson crossed the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats in 1995, agrees: “I suddenly flipped,” she told Radio 4’s Today programme this week. “I was getting sick and tired of John Major’s vacillation on the European issue. I could suddenly take it no longer.“The worst thing about changing political parties is that you hurt people, and you hurt people who you love dearly, admire, respected, even fought with, but you hurt them very much indeed, and to live with that hurt is really, really difficult.”Like Woodward, who was dismayed by what he saw as the abandonment by Hague of One Nation Toryism, former Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger considers that her party left her, rather than the other way round. In 2019 she co-founded The Independent Group in response to what she viewed as a failure to act against anti-Semitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership this later became a new political party, Change UK, before Berger eventually joined the Liberal Democrats.“It was horrific to leave my political home of 20 years,” she reflects, “but in my mind it didn’t in any way represent the values that led me to it in the first place, so I could no longer be a part of it.“I absolutely made the right decision and I don’t have any regrets and I would do it again.” Jumping ship used to be a far more common affair – Winston Churchill decamped from the Conservatives to the Liberal Party in 1904, not returning to the fold for two decades. But even then “ratting” was a high stakes game. When a group of Labour MPs resigned the whip to join Oswald Mosley’s fascist New Party in 1931, two quit after a day to become independents.In recent years, defecting has proven something of a kamikaze mission of the 23 MPs who crossed the floor in the last 30 years, all but four lost their seats at the next election, Berger among them. Of the four who survived, two – including Woodward – had been offered safer seats than those they had won under a different party’s banner.The only two to have triumphed again at the ballot box are Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who quit the Conservatives for the UK Independent Party in 2014 crucially, both took the decision to resign as MPs and stand again in a by-election (Reckless, however, lost at the next general election).Carswell says the decision to fight a by-election was partly tactical, to put maximum pressure on then-prime minister David Cameron to hold a referendum on the question of Britain’s membership of the European Union, but also a matter of principle. Carswell’s defection was greeted relatively positively by both the voters and his party activists in his constituency of Clacton, with many in his local association following him to Ukip. To his surprise, most of his former Conservative colleagues in Parliament also remained on friendly terms.“I think they had respect for the fact that I had submitted myself to a by-election,” he says. “Had I not done that, they would have seen it as a case of getting elected under their colours then abandoning them.”That’s not to say that Carswell didn’t find the process emotional.“Anyone who is leaving one party for another is going to find difficulties. The only way to neutralise that is to resign and call a by-election.”Woodward, however, disagrees. “If you think that every time somebody crosses the floor there should be a by-election then Parliament should change the law. It shouldn’t be a reaction to one inidual’s actions. At the moment we still put the name of the candidate on the ballot paper – not the party.”Saying that, Woodward admits he felt far more comfortable in the Labour Party once he fought a general election in his new seat of St Helens. This, he says, helped him to get away from the disapproval of his former activists in his former constituency of true blue Whitney.Of Wakeford he says: “Actually, I think if he stood for a by-election, he’d probably win.” Additional reporting by Eleanor Steafel Rosa Prince is editor of The House magazineMore from NewsJacinda Ardern postpones own wedding after introducing new Covid restrictionsFull list of Tories calling for Boris Johnson to resign - and those still backing the PMRussia accuses Britain of spreading \u0026#39nonsense\u0026#39 about plan to install puppet government in UkraineNusrat Ghani urged by Boris Johnson to make formal complaint over claim her \u0026#39Muslimness\u0026#39 was an issueKyiv compares German admiral to \u0026#39a Nazi occupier\u0026#39 after he said Putin needs \u0026#39respect\u0026#39Weak institutions are giving in to the identity politics thought policeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"really happened christmas post","story":"Christmas didn’t so much come late as barely arrive at all for Sarah Merritt. By mid-December, there were six cards on the mantelpiece of her Chelmsford home a month later, more than 10 times as many have landed on her doormat, typically in sporadic “dumps of 25 or 30” at a time. On January 13, the IT manager received a festive card that had been stamped a full month prior on Wednesday, she got another. Handmade cards, cards from friends in Australia and Holland “It’s such a shame they didn’t arrive in time,” the 47-year-old says. “They’re just in a pile at the moment. I can’t bring myself to throw them away.”Merritt is one of thousands beset by recent Royal Mail delays, where “significant disruption” to service currently s 56 postcodes. People in areas from Bicester to Paisley have reported missing hospital appointment notifications, parking tickets, prescriptions, cheques, Covid tests, football tickets, even passports and wedding certificates, all due to absent post.Why this is happening – and indeed keeps happening – is not down to just one thing. Undeniably, Covid has played a heavy hand. In the first week of January, around 15,000 Royal Mail staff were sick or isolating due to omicron – last week, that figure was 13,000, twice the usual rate of absentees for this time of year. In some local offices, up to a third of staff are off – an even more significant number considering the service is now contracted by the NHS to deliver Covid tests, and runs parcel drop-offs seven days a week (as of 2020).Omicron-induced disruption has become a familiar story across the UK, but Royal Mail seems to suffer more than most. One in seven of its staff were off at the start of January – more than three times higher than the number of NHS doctors currently afflicted. Some Royal Mail workers say poor enforcement of protocols has led to rampant spread of the virus among employees at branches. At the depot where Jamie Houser* works, four colleagues tested positive last week – mask-wearing is mandatory, but “a lot of the staff do not wear masks and the mask mandate’s enforcement changes from manager to manager, so staff shortages can occur unexpectedly”. Cramped eating facilities, a lack of Perspex screens, multiple iniduals sorting through post in confined spaces the response to safety issues raised “has been lacklustre,” the 25-year-old says. “I can honestly say management tries harder to keep people off their phones than wear a mask.”On the ground, people are increasingly exasperated. This month, The  has received numerous letters from readers about missing post, including Keith Appleyard in Kent, who has received “only one postal delivery since Christmas,” and Bernard Powell, who paid his Lancashire delivery office an “insufficient postage charge” when the item was sent on December 16, yet still hasn’t received it.Many have been left with one question: why is Royal Mail seemingly failing to deliver, where other competitors can? Last year, an internal memo from the company’s chief commercial officer, Nick Landon, reported that Amazon was the most-trusted delivery service among Brits, edging Royal Mail, which was fully privatised in 2015, into second place. “All of our pride should be dented by Amazon Logistics taking the top spot,” he wrote in an email to staff.“We’ve always had issues with Royal Mail’s service and even more so their attitude and contempt for their customers,” says Craig Manship, who sells badges and pins via his online shop TheBadgeman. “However, when you have the monopoly on the system why would you expect anything less?” He says Royal Mail delays can sometimes cost his small business over £400 a week in refunds to angry customers.Amazon’s Covid track record has drawn dramatically fewer complaints. Yes, it has a smaller volume of parcels to deliver – Royal Mail currently has a 34 per cent market share of deliveries, while Amazon’s is 15 per cent – but it sends most items via a tracked service, which research shows reduces issues with orders by 60 per cent. It allows Amazon to aim for an on-time delivery record above 97 per cent whereas at one point last year, Royal Mail’s on-time First Class deliveries dropped to below 75 per cent. They remain below the levels mandated by Ofcom, the regulator, which reported last year that Royal Mail “needs to adapt to the changing market, modernise its parcel delivery operations, and become more efficient”.Around a third of the UK’s 1,400 delivery offices have introduced geomapping technology to redraw postal routes, which has also “caused some problems,” explains Mark Baulch, assistant secretary at the Communication Workers’ Union, which represents almost 200,000 members. Those in charge are typically in an office, hundreds of miles away from the district they are tasked with improving: online mapping tools, particularly in rural areas, can fail to accurately calculate how long it will take to get a sack of post to the top of a winding lane, for instance. That means postmen “struggle to complete” their round, which “is where we’re having some issues on quality,” Baulch admits. Post not delivered during its intended shift is then bumped onto someone else’s – potentially doubling the workload of someone already failing to fulfil demands.George Osborne described Royal Mail’s privatisation seven years ago as “a win all round – for customers, the workforce and the taxpayer.” For shareholders, things have never looked brighter – they received a slice of a £400 million pie last year, when the company posted a £311 million pre-tax profit in the six months to September 2021. For the first two groups, though, the last few months have been more loss than victory.Baulch knows that the current delays are “not good enough”, and hopes that omicron dwindling will “improve and restore quality of service.” But while Royal Mail says it is “providing targeted support” to offices that are struggling, bolder ideas – or at least, functional technology and a full workforce – are urgently required. “There isn’t a magic solution,” Baulch says. For the service, and the tens of thousands of customers still awaiting their post and parcels, more’s the pity.*Details have been changed     More from NewsJacinda Ardern postpones own wedding after introducing new Covid restrictionsFull list of Tories calling for Boris Johnson to resign - and those still backing the PMRussia accuses Britain of spreading \u0026#39nonsense\u0026#39 about plan to install puppet government in UkraineNusrat Ghani urged by Boris Johnson to make formal complaint over claim her \u0026#39Muslimness\u0026#39 was an issueKyiv compares German admiral to \u0026#39a Nazi occupier\u0026#39 after he said Putin needs \u0026#39respect\u0026#39Weak institutions are giving in to the identity politics thought policeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"silence putins imperialism exposes basic hypocrisy woke left","story":"Beware of -isms. The term “imperialism” is terribly imprecise. Should we define it in Lenin’s terms as the “highest stage of capitalism”? But then much will depend on what we mean by capitalism, and empires have been around much longer than that. Woke enthusiasts for critical race theory may mention the world empire created by sixteenth-century Spain, without saying anything about the empires created by the Aztecs and the Incas on the backs of other native peoples of the Americas. Instead, the term “imperialism” has become attached to the empires created by Portugal, Spain, Holland, France and Britain, each of which had a very distinctive character.But imperialism seems to be on the way back. Over the last few centuries, Russia and China conquered peoples and carved out their borders in competition for the Eurasian landmass, and even now tensions occasionally erupt between them along the Amur River in western Siberia.Tension in and around the South China Sea is nothing new, either: in the fifteenth century the famous eunuch admiral Zheng He managed to bring Java to heel, and established a base at Melaka in what is now Malaysia. China’s “Belt and Road’ strategy frequently cites Zheng He’s voyages, and has resulted in the creation of naval bases at Gwadar and Djibouti, in waters where Zheng He sailed. Djibouti is highly desirable: it commands the straits leading into the Red Sea, and Gwadar in Pakistan, close to the Persian Gulf, is the intended terminus of a railway running all the way to Beijing.The echoes of the past are also becoming louder in eastern Europe. What nineteenth-century historians called the “Eastern Question” has been revived as Vladimir Putin sits tight in Crimea, contemplates an invasion of Ukraine and continues to offer support to the brutal regime in Belarus.Will a contrived border incident spark a war that results in the fall of Kyiv? That would echo the moment in 1939 when Germany and Russia suddenly became allies and decided to carve up Poland. The Russian claim to Ukraine is based on a particular reading of history where the foundation of a principality around Kyiv in the tenth century is seen as the birth of Mother Russia. In Soviet days it was considered unwise to emphasise that the founders of the principality were Viking warriors from the Baltic rather than Slavs.But where are the voices on the woke Left denouncing Putin’s attempt to sew back the disjointed fragments of the Soviet Union, something that can only be described as a new brand of imperialism? They only seem to care about imperialism if Britain or the like can be held responsible. If they think about the present day at all, it is to attack a country such as Israel. Those activists who argue that the West Bank settlements are illegal say nothing about the legality of the occupation of Crimea.We thought that we were living in an age when the forcible acquisition of territory based on obsolete historical claims should no longer be possible. The Baltic States are understandably nervous, particularly when Moscow makes noises about the Russian-speaking populations in their countries. Having travelled by road across the Baltic states three years ago, I wonder whether the surprising narrowness of the roads linking them is a deliberate defensive move intended to slow the advance of an invading army – if so, a wise precaution.To the woke, though, they are far-off countries of which they know nothing. As the world seems to be building up towards what has been described as potentially the gravest crisis since the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, far-Left activists gleefully concentrate on the evils of vanished empires created several centuries ago, and obstinately ignore one that is being recreated on Europe’s doorstep at this very moment.David Abulafia is professor of history at the University of CambridgeMore from NewsJacinda Ardern postpones own wedding after introducing new Covid restrictionsFull list of Tories calling for Boris Johnson to resign - and those still backing the PMRussia accuses Britain of spreading \u0026#39nonsense\u0026#39 about plan to install puppet government in UkraineNusrat Ghani urged by Boris Johnson to make formal complaint over claim her \u0026#39Muslimness\u0026#39 was an issueKyiv compares German admiral to \u0026#39a Nazi occupier\u0026#39 after he said Putin needs \u0026#39respect\u0026#39Weak institutions are giving in to the identity politics thought policeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sunday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Welcome to your early morning news briefing from The  - a round-up of the top stories we are covering on Sunday.

Local authorities are finalising their annual budgets this month and next to pay for rubbish removal and other public services. But chief executives are telling them they must be socially distanced when they do and many council chambers are not big enough to get all councillors in. The Government passed emergency legislation to allow councils to meet and vote over Zoom during the pandemic. But that ran out last year and the Tories refuse to make Parliamentary time available to renew it. Which means councillors can only vote in person. Peter Fleming, leader of Kent’s Sevenoaks District Council, said: “Councils are sovereign bodies and we should be able to decide for ourselves how we meet. “This doesn’t say much about the independence of local authorities.”  Councils have a legal duty to set budgets and every councillor has the right to vote on them. Hiring large venues just to comply with the law will have to be added to council tax bills. And that’s onlythey have somewhere big enough nearby.If they cannot meet they will either have to extend existing budgets, or get Communities Secretary Michael Gove to set them.  And any big spending decisions will have to be delayed.A spokesperson for the Local Government Association representing  councils said: “ Budget meetings can be the most important councils hold each year and are normally the most heavily attended.“Holding these meetings wholly in person is unnecessary when councils have demonstrated over the pandemic that it is possible to meet in a remote or hybrid way.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Michael GoveBoris JohnsonCouncil taxPublic servicesPoliticsSexuality\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But he may not have been expecting a raft of handwritten letters landing on his doorstep from members of the public. The letters - which started arriving at Brady’s Parliamentary office this week - express outrage and disappointment at the partygate revelations. Many call on the Prime Minister to resign.  A signicant number of the letters come from lelong Conservative voters who say they can simply no longer vote for the party while Boris Johnson remains as leader and Prime Minister. One letter, signed by John from Stirling, read: “I have voted Tory for over  years. No longer.  He added: “I am disgusted with them and as leader of the party and our Prime Minister Boris Johnson must accept full responsibility - after all itaposs his house - and resign. Another, from Gillian - a lelong Tory voter from Inverness - read: “Like so many, during this time I wasn’t able to see or hug my mother… I lost two years of being able to see and speak to her, and now on September th  she died… She added: “I have always voted Conservative, as did my parents, but I can assure you that the Conservatives, nor any other party, will get my vote in future. I’m finished, done with you all.”  And a third, from Douglas from Orpington, reads: “On the night of Johnsons ‘Work Meeting’ my  year old Grandson was in AE suffering the effects of long Covid. My Daughter was with him, but his father had to sit outside in his car for four and a half hours, due to Government rules. “My story is slight compared to the suffering of others and it is with respect to their grief that I ask you to bring this tawdry chapter in the party’s history to an end”  Sir Grahamaposs bulging mailbag includes letters furious letters from distinguished public servants, including William, an Emeritus staff member of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge.It includes an anonymous letter from a former Ministry of Defence civil servant - as well as a number of GPs and NHS nurses.Ellie Gellard, Campaigns Director at  Degrees, said: “Here - in handwritten letters from people right across the country - you can see the extent of the heartbreak and anger so many are feeling. She added: “How those in power are held to account for this rule breaking is, formally, a matter for Conservative MPs and the Committee which Sir Graham Brady oversees. But members of the public, including those who were kept from relatives as they passed away, deserve to have their voices heard too. “While he may be waiting on only fty four, thousands of letters have now been posted to the  Committee chairman - including hundreds from Conservative voters and members who are warning of the political cost of being seen to let the most powerful people in this country off scot free.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSConservative PartyMinistry of DefenceGraham BradyBoris JohnsonCivil servantsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, some people will still wear face masksBoris Johnson announced the lting of Plan B restrictions next week Image: PAopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Jan | commentsHeadteachers who insist that pupils still wear masks in schools should be praised, not pilloried.They are doing the responsible thing. The same cannot be said of the Prime Minister. While the number of Omicron cases is falling in London it is still re in other parts of England. Boris Johnson chose to ignore this when he announced a blanket lting of Plan B restrictions this week.The sensible course would have been to maintain our guard until the threat posed by Omicron had subsided in every region. The Prime Minister is not being driven by the data – despite his repeated claims – but by politically expediency. Many believe he rushed into it because his job is on the line and he needs to curry favour with his backbenchers. It is entirely in keeping with Johnson’s behaviour that he has put his own interests ahead of those of the country. By continuing to wear masks the public are showing better judgment than those making the rules. Game to act There are few more sickening trades than trophy hunting. Killing endangered animals is not a sport but a heartless act of barbarity. So it is depressing to read that big game hunting is still big business in the US. The annual Safari Club International Convention in Las Vegas offers bloodthirsty Americans the chance to spend tens of thousands of dollars to slaughter wild animals. The UK government has pledged action on trophy hunting but has so far failed to bring in the necessary legislation. There is no reason for this delay. Ministers should set an example and bring in the Bill now.  Magical Meat Meat Loaf stormed the charts like a bat out of hell.

This week he told us no one had told him the party he went to was against the rules, although it took place at a time when he announced every night that parties were against the rules.Soon he will explain in detail that: “I wasn’t told the rules I read out were rules. I thought they were a bus timetable, or lyrics of a song by Bruce Springsteen, or instructions for erecting an IKEA CD rack.” Then a series of emails will be discovered, warning him the party was against the rules, so he’ll say: “Ah but they were in English, and at the time I only spoke Klingon.”  One of the worst parts is the standard of lying is so poor. If you had a three-year-old boy who drew on the wall then lied about it this badly you would sob “what sort of demented child is this” and end up talking to Lorraine on ITV about the moment you discovered your son had “Lying Idiot Fruitbat Syndrome”. Now he’s trying to appeal to his backbench MPs with new announcements such as scrapping the TV licence. Next he’ll announce: “We are bringing back fox-hunting, but indoors in leisure centres to appeal to Red Wall voters.”  Then he decided to blame whoever he could to save himself such as the staff or whoever forgot to tell him about the rules. By Wednesday he’ll say: “The party in the garden wouldn’t have happenedthe gardener hadn’t put a garden there.” Then he’ll blame the Queen, saying “She made me organise a party as she had too much cheese and hummus coming up to its sell-by date, and she hates waste, and she saidI didn’t do it she’d get Andrew to poison my dog.” Evenhe was telling the truth about how much he remembers, you could argue thatyou can’t remember an illegal party in your own garden you probably ought to be in a home with a warden rather than in charge of a country with nuclear weapons. Instead he’s set off a war in the Conservative Party. David Davis quoted Oliver Cromwell at his old colleague Johnson, saying: “In the name of God, go.” And he’ll probably go further this week and quote the Duke of Wellington saying in : “**** off and don’t come back you useless lying ****.” So now Johnson is in such tangles that he tells us he apologises for breaking the rules he didn’t break as he can’t have known what were the rules he didn’t break, but he can’t knowhe was where he said he was when he was breaking the rules he didn’t know he was breaking despite making them, until the investigation tells him. I hope he stays for a few weeks because the country’s stuffed but we deserve some entertainment in .

The Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary said the UK will support the Ukraine to defend themselves. But said it would be extremely unlikelyfor British troops to be sent to Ukraine to physically bolster their defence. Last night Britain accused Vladimir Putin of plotting to install a puppet leader in Ukraine.The Foreign Office took the unusual step of naming former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev as a potential Kremlin candidate who would run Ukraine.  Mr Raab told Sky Newsapos Trevor Philips on Sunday: Weaposre standing shoulder to shoulder saying there will be very serious consequencesRussia takes this move to try and invade and also install a puppet regime.Vadym Prystaiko Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said he believes Mr Putin is capable of installing a pro-Moscow leader in the country.I do believe that. Itaposs not the first time theyaposve tried to do that, he told Sky News and added Ukraine is prepared to fight back.Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry said Labour backs the Governmentaposs approach to Russian aggression. Ms Thornberry also called for the Government to utilise a “new generation of sanctions”, including investigating the “unexplained wealth” of Putin allies living in the UK. The unusual move from the Foreign Office came as Western allies stepped up warnings that Russia will pay a heavy pricethe estimated , troops massed on the border launch any kind of incursion into Ukraine.In a statement, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the Russian plotting showed the s to which the Kremlin was prepared go to undermine the government in Kyiv.“The information being released today shines a light on the extent of Russian activity designed to subvert Ukraine, and is an insight into Kremlin thinking,” she said.  “Russia must de-escalate, end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy. “As the UK and our partners have said repeatedly, any Russian military incursion into Ukraine would be a massive strategic mistake with severe costs.” Foreign Secreary Liz Truss has previously warned Mr Putin he must “desist and step back” from war in Ukraine or risk being dragged into a prolonged conflict like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

Britain deserves better. It is time for Boris Johnson to go.”The Prime Minister faces yet more Partygate grief this week when a report into lockdown gatherings at No is published. One MP also plans to speak to the police about allegations of blackmail. The threat of a vote of no confidence is still hanging over Mr Johnson – and six of his top colleagues are now vying to take his job. Some have even started raising campaign funds.Chancellor Rishi Sunak and former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remain the frontrunners.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter But Trade minister Penny Mordaunt and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi are also in the running, along with Foreign Affairs Committee chair Tom Tugendhat and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss – favourite among Tory party members.It will be a knock-out contest before the last two standing face a members’ vote. One MP said: “There will be a lot of tactical voting. Most of us think it will be a disasterLiz makes the last two as she’s sure to get in.” But supporters of Mr Sunak and Mr Hunt have agreed a “non-aggression pact” to ensure she is squeezed out. Tory MPs’ shop steward Sir Graham Brady needs  letters of no confidence before a vote can be held on whether to replace the Prime Minister. But the chair of the backbench  committee has received more than , others – many from lelong Conservatives – who say they will never vote for the party again. One signed by John, from Stirling, wrote: “I have voted Tory for over  years. No longer. I am disgusted with them.” And Douglas, of Orpington, Kent, said: “On the night of Johnson’s ‘work meeting’ my -year-old grandson was in AE suffering long Covid. Bring this tawdry chapter in the party’s history to an end.” The crisis deepened today after William Wragg, chair of the Commons Public Administration Committee, confirmed he will speak to police about allegations that Tory whips “blackmailed” MPs. Mr Wakeford revealed: “Gavin Williamson told me I wouldn’t get a promised new school in Bury SouthI voted the wrong way.” Chair of the Standards Committee, Labour’s Chris Bryant, said thatthe claim is true, it could lead to charges of misconduct in public office. Most Tories are waiting for Sue Gray’s report into the No parties before deciding their next move – and they are furious that some MPs rushed in letters last week. Ms Gray has reportedly found an email warning the PM’s private secretary, Martin Reynolds, against holding a drinks party at No in the first lockdown. Mr Johnson – who said he spent  minutes at the do thinking it was a work event – will speak to MPs this weekend to try and shore up support.

No, seriously, don’t laugh. It was the signicant other’s signicant birthday. Venue checked, band booked, furthest away guests invited, budget swallowed with a big gulp. Then the Covid surge loomed and it was time to call the whole thing off. It was, as everybody sympathetically agreed, the decent thing to do. Didn’t, for some reason, think to call it a “work event” to get round the rules. Guests implicitly agreed that going ahead would be the wrong thing to do. Tough, but nothing compared to the sacrices of others while No partied like a prohibition Speakeasy.Boris Johnson says he “implicitly believed” the drinks party he claims to have stumbled into was a work event, inviting the nation to believe in a Prime Minister who takes citizens for fools. He could have put his foot down when the rules applying to everyone  were being flouted in front of his eyes. Just once, early on, would have done it. A bit of leadership would have got the message across. Instead he sailed on, captaining a Downing Street booze cruise through lockdown restrictions which saw families torn apart, even in the hour of death for their loved ones. The image of the Queen in mournful isolation the day after No staff boozed into the early hours is a powerfully symbolic damnation of the entire scandal. We await the official report from Whitehall sleuth Sue Gray. It was never her civil servant’s job to deliver a killer blow to the Johnson premiership. But her report is a minefield of unexploded bombs – not least those planted by Dominic Cummings – which could trigger the coup de grace on a political le that is already ­effectively over.  Trust, the leblood of a PM’s authority, has been terminated. Slippery Boris may attempt to slither through the Gray dynamite but the long game is up. Critical is whether it can be shown he lied to Parliament. But convincing a pathological liar that they are lying might not be easy. Tory MPs are fearful of this PM leading them into a general election, or even the local elections. But the backfiring defection of Tory Christian Wakeford turned the pork pie revolt stale before it could be served. It threw the crestfallen Big Dog a bone. Bojo got his mojo back and determined to fight on, with a raft of Operation Red Meat announcements to shore up the crumbling edice. Tilting at the BBC and turning the lting of Covid restrictions, and the nation’s health, into a political stunt. Nothing to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis, mind. Chancellor Rishi Sunak must be too busy choosing his furniture for Number . Johnson made fools of his own MPs over humiliating U-turns on free school meals and Tory MP Owen Paterson’s contempt for lobbying rules. If they fail to do the right thing this week they will make fools of themselves and underpin the ongoing damage to British democracy. It might suit Keir Starmer to see the Tories saddled with a laughing stock PM for a little longer. But the only signicant date in the PM’s diary should be his exit.

Nusrat Ghani, MP for Wealden was a transport minister from January  until February . The married mum became the first female MP to hold her Wealden seat in , winning with a majority of ,. But Ms Ghani considered quitting politics after her interaction with a Government whip who said her Muslimness was raised as an issue at a Downing Street meeting, she told the Sunday Times. The whip added her Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable, and questioned her loyalty to the Party. Ms Ghani, now vice-chairwoman of the powerful  Committee of Tory backbenchers told the newspaper: It was like being punched in the stomach. I felt humiliated and powerless. I was told... that there were concerns aposthat I wasnapost loyal to the party as I didnapost do enough to defend the party against Islamophobia allegationsapos. Ms Ghaniaposs claims relate to a meeting back in March . When she raised the issue, she was asked to use the formal complaints procedure but she declined to.Government Chief Whip Mark Spencer took to Twitter to identy himself as the person behind the MPaposs claims. In one now-deleted tweet, he wrote: To ensure other whips are not drawn into this matter, I am identying myself as the person Nusrat Ghani MP has made claims about this evening. These accusations are completely  and I consider them to be defamatory. I have never used those words attributed to me.  The conduct of the whipsapos office has come under intense scrutiny amid accusations they used intimidation and blackmail to pressure MPs seeking to oust Boris Johnson as Prime Minister.William Wragg, the senior Tory who first raised the issue and chairman of the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, praised Ghaniaposs courage in speaking out. He said: Nus is very brave to speak out. I was truly appalled to learn of her experience. She shows such strength and integrity supporting others. I am proud to have her as my friend and colleague. We must change things for the better. Wragg will be meeting a Scotland Yard detective in the House of Commons early next week to discuss his own claims. He told The Dailyhe would outline several examples of bullying and intimidation, in some cases involving public money. Fellow Tory MP and former minister Steve Baker also described Ghaniaposs treatment as completely intolerable and suggested her claims be investigated further. He tweeted: I value Nus Ghani as a great colleague and Iaposm appalled. We must get to the bottom of it. Cabinet Minister Nadhim Zahawi and senior Tory MP Tom Tugendhadt also backed Ms Ghani on Twitter, with Mr Zahawi calling for an inquiry on the matter. has contacted No for comment.

However, the symptoms have been found very dferent from the classic three signs of Covid that we are used to.According to the NHS, the most common signs of coronavirus are a fever, new and continuous cough as well as a loss or change to sense of taste or smell.But is a change to your sense of taste a symptom of Omicron  Hereaposs everything you need to know Is altered taste a symptom of Omicron   A loss or change to your sense of taste or smell means that people who have coronavirus tend not be able to smell or taste anything properly, or things will smell or taste slightly dferent to normal. However, Omicron symptoms have been found to be dferent, with members of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , saying: There is some preliminary evidence emerging of changes in reported symptoms with Omicron infection. In particular, loss of taste or smell seem to be reported less frequently.  Professor Tim Spector of King’s College London, who is leading ZOE symptom appaposs Covid study, also warned that many people may not realise they have Covid. This is because Omicron symptoms are more similar to a common cold and donapost present with a cough, fever, or loss of taste or smell. Though symptoms of the virus have continued to change, there hasnapost been any updates made to the governmentaposs official symptoms list since last spring. How to tellyour sense of taste or smell has changed  An estimated , UK adults have been affected by a change or loss of sense of taste smell, according to Fth Sense, a charity for people affected by smell and taste disorders. The symptom means that food gives off an unpleasant odour or taste, such as rotten meat or chemicals. The specic cause for sensory loss is unknown, but a study published in the Nature Genetics journal suggests that genetics could be play an important role in a person experiencing loss or change in taste or smell after Covid infection. While smell training which involves snfing at least four distinctive smells to retrain the brain is one way to regain sensory loss, most people who experience smell and taste loss because of virus usually regain their sense spontaneously. What are the main symptoms of Omicron   The most common symptoms of Omicron, according to the ZOE Covid study are:Scratchy throat Runny NoseFatigue Body aches and pains SneezingOther reported signs of the iant include headaches, congestion, nausea and vomiting, skin rashes, night sweats, brain fog. The symptoms should last up to five days and be mild for most people.

The Department of Health says there are currently no plans to delay the mandate, as it is the right thing to do to protect patients, the BBC reports.It comes after NHS staff staged a protest in opposition to the Governmentaposs clampdown in cities across England, including Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds.  Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said the Governmentaposs vaccine mandate was not the right way forward. The vast majority of NHS staff are vaccinated, but , to , workers remain without the jab, Mr Marshall told BBC Radio aposs Today programme. These members of staff account for just  per cent of the entire workforce at some hospital or GP surgeries, he continued. The chairman warned that removing large numbers of employees from the frontline would lead to massive consequences.  If the Government delayed their April  cut off, there would be enough time for staff to have a booster and give space for discussion about whether mandatory vaccinations are suitable, he said.It comes days after Dr Hilary Jones shared he no longer believes it should be mandatory for NHS staff to have the Covid vaccine. Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Hilary explained that forcing healthcare workers to get the vaccine but then ditching self-isolation, even for people who have tested positive for the virus, didnapost make sense. It comes amid reports that , healthcare professionals remain unvaccinated, and are at risk of losing their jobs over the mandatory policy.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"crazed rats seen terrifying binmen","story":"Crazed rats seen terrying binmen by jumping out of overflowing rubbish pileSeveral refuse collectors are now having to tuck their trousers into their socks to stop the rats from scurrying up their legs and biting them, according to expertsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video rats-scurry-away-rubbish-workers-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:iBZPSOqj,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In a skin-crawling clip, one worker can be seen nervously approaching the overflowing rubbish before giving the bins a kick. Nothing happens after the first few blows - but eventually the vermin hiding inside eating food which has not been properly disposed of take off scurry out onto drainpipes and across the ground. As many as  rats can be seen in the footage running away. Experts have now said the overfilled bins are leaving workers at risk of being attacked by the rats. Several workers are now even having to tuck their trousers into their socks to stop the vermin running up their legs. Business Waste’s Mark Hall told the Daily Star : “Monday mornings are the worst as bins are overflowing from the weekend with kebabs and tasty food from restaurants.“Our operators come up against rats on a daily basis, but Mondays are especially bad and our teams are genuinely worried about getting bitten.” The rat population in the UK soared during lockdown to around  million. The number is thought to still be on the rise, with many waste collectors off sick due to Covid restrictions, often leaving household rubbish to mount up. Binman Mark Taylor, , from Addingham, added: “When we go to empty a bin on a Monday, there’s a stream of rats running to safety. “It’s really badit’s a food store or a restaurant, and they haven’t secured the lid. We’re clubbing the bins with a big stick, then giving them a couple of minutes to run away. It’s terrying.”Waste Collection companyDivert’s Operations Director Adam Bailey, said: “Once disturbed, the vermin are in a state of panic and run in all directions.“Our teams now go into action with trousers tucked into boots and sleeve cuffs done up tight. But that’s still no guarantee.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TrousersGiant rats\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Paul Page, who worked in the Royal Protection Command from  until , alleges he personally made three separate complaints to palace officials. And he claims he is aware of “at least a dozen” other reports made by colleagues. Mr Page, whose revelations this week sparked a string of complaints about the prince, said: “Buckingham Palace launched a bullying investigation against Meghan last year after she was accused of wrongdoing. “If it’s a fair organisation that looks after its staff, an investigation should be started to confirm whether or not Andrew is guilty of being a bully and of intimidating staff.”  He alleges complaints he raised during his service were ignored because senior courtiers did not want to create a stir. Mr Page told the Sunday Mirror: “The Palace have a problem because there are instances and evidence of Prince Andrew being overbearing and verbally abusive.” He said in an ITV documentary this week that Andrew would “shout and scream”his collection of toy bears on his bed were not placed in exact positions by maids. That prompted the prince’s former maid Charlotte Briggs, , to come forward with allegations. She accused Andrew, then in his s, of foul-mouthed rants and ludicrous demands. They included making her run up four flights of stairs to close his curtains while, she says, he was right next to them.  She also told of being in tears and of hiding to avoid the “bad-tempered” and “entitled” royal. Diplomat Simon Wilson, who hosted the duke in Bahrain, previously claimed the “rude” and “boorish” prince had “childish obsessions” and was nicknamed HBH by staff – for His Buffoon Highness. Former maid Janette McGowan, , claimed she had to check a Polaroid of  teddy bears on Andrew’s bed and lay them out in exact positions to avoid him becoming angry. Mr Page claimed there “must have been at least a dozen complaints” about bullying in the time he was there. He alleged: “It was well known in the palace, but no investigation was conducted by the royal household.”  Mr Page claimed a colleague had been called a “fat lardy-a***d c***” by the prince after stopping a woman at the gates who had not been listed as an invited guest. He said: “Even the woman went bright red and said, ‘I’m really sorry’. Another time a woman got locked in and he came down f-ing and blinding and ranting.” Andrew,  – ninth in line to the throne – is facing calls to be evicted from -room Royal Lodge after being told to stop using his HRH title and stripped of his military titles and charitable affiliations.  He is fighting sex assault claims in the US in a civil suit by Virginia Giuffre, the alleged sex slave of his former pal Jeffrey Epstein. He vehemently denies the claims. Mr Page lost his job when he was convicted over a £million investment fraud in . The Palace and a spokesman for Prince Andrew declined to comment.

The Reaseheath Agricultural College students claim they saw local builders were allowed in for a meal while wearing filthy boots. Teen farmer Jamie Goode, , from Holmes Chapel, said: “We were shocked when they wouldn’t let us in. We just laughed at them. “This lady was standing there and said that before we could enter, we had to take our boots off.  All our boots were clean and certainly not mucky but they insisted they wouldnapost let us in unless we took them off. There were a lot of workmen going in with their boots on, and theirs were filthy. Jamie believes someone from his college may have told restaurant staff to stop students entering with their boots on. He said: When we asked why [we couldnapost go in], they said Reaseheath [college] said we should be told to take our boots off. “But when we got back, the college said they knew nothing about such an instruction. They said it was probably a health and safety issue to ask to take our boots off, but this is not rightthey are allowing the building trade inside with their boots. He added: “We don’t even understand how they knew that we were from the college – we didn’t have our ID badges on or anything. A spokesperson from McDonaldaposs said: “We are proud supporters of British and Irish agriculture and work with over , farmers across the UK and Ireland. We have a strong relationship with the local Agricultural college and we have an agreement in place to ensure students that visit our restaurant remove their wellington boots, to ensure the restaurant maintains the high standards that all our customers expect. We greatly appreciate the cooperation of the college and students, and look forward to continuing to welcome them to our restaurant in the future.” The Mirror has contacted McDonaldaposs for further comment.

But the reality of working for a high street bakery can be quite dferent. Christian Brayford worked at Greggs and revealed the secrets of the bakery and what staff have to deal with ion a daily basis. And he says the free food and drinks which come as a perk of the job were not worth the time, effort and aposextremely dficultapos circumstances workers faced. GrimsbyLive reports the realities of working at the High Street bakery where he worked at multiple locations. Hereaposs what he had to sayI worked at Greggs what feels like a millennium ago. In fact, it was only back in January  but world events and a global pandemic have caused time to seemingly stop in its wake.I really enjoyed the food - I still do now. I often go to the Greggs on Old Brumby Street for a pasty treat .Whenever Iaposm in Grimsby, Iaposll always nip in to the Victoria Street store for a pink jammie doughnut.I used to work at Greggs in Tadcaster, just off the A heading to York. At the time, I was a sht leader so I was in charge of cash handling, staff management, dealing with complaints, ordering stock, and banking at the end of the day.  The working hours could be extremely demanding. You had to be there at am on some shts, and usually you wouldnapost leave until after pm or later. And when you arrived for work, it was absolutely freezing. It was probably colder outside the shop than it was in it - without the exaggeration. This was back in January so in the early hours of the morning it was particularly icy and brisk. You werenapost allowed to wear a jumper either - you were provided with a Greggs hat, Greggs t-shirt, a kitchen apron and a hair net .  Breakfast is a huge part of Greggs and why people love it so much. The egg, sausage and omelette roll was always a firm favourite of mine - along with ketchup. At the start of the sht, youaposd have to put the delivery away. I found it odd that Greggs has two deliveries in a day - one in the very early hours of the morning and one in the afternoon. But this was dependant on the storeaposs location. Our store used to have a delivery at around am or am in the morning.  This was when youaposd have a delivery of all your sweet treats such as triple chocolate doughnuts, jam heart biscuits, Belgian buns and much more. We would spend time on the delivery and preparing for breakfast - ensuring enough trays of bacon, sausage and omelette were prepared for the busiest part of the day. And it was also the time that the bulk of sandwiches were made. So whether you like a roast chicken and bacon club sandwich, a tuna crunch baguette, or a chargrill chicken oval bite, this was the prime time that they were made. There was a specic guide, or cooking matrix, which had to be followed to incredible detail when preparing a sandwich. It came down to the right amount of sauce, the right amount of vegetable and the right amount of protein or meat. If you went over by the slightest margin, youaposd have to make the sandwich again. This is not to say that sandwiches werenapost made throughout the day because they were, whatever was running short or low, weaposd always have someone in the back preparing them from fresh.  Mostly all the items sold in Greggs are made in one of its factories, which are then transported to its stores to be refrigerated or to be kept frozen. All the pasties, cookies, sausages, croissants, pain au chocolates were frozen before cooking. The way to tell the dference with a Greggs pasty is by the design and shapes on its surface. For instance, a corned beef pasty has horizontal little lines across its surface. It never took long to cook them as the cookers were fantastically hot and very large to pack in almost everything you needed for the day. Drinks were always a nightmare, it would take what felt like an hour to prepare one when you had a queue so long and people getting very agitated for a sausage roll. And you always used to see the same people every day. That was always nice as you got to connect with people and have a bit of a chat and a laugh. But there were also times when it wasnapost great.  Especially when you had a man from Plymouth shouting in your face because you didnapost have any milk chocolate cookies available or when Peter from York couldnapost use a loyalty stamp that was out of date. I strongly sympathise and understand all customer service workers who go through similar things - but in dferent situations and environments - on a daily basis. It certainly made it harder to motivate yourself to get up in the morning. And the close down was always a nightmare. We would practice hygiene and cleaning throughout the day on a aposclean as you go basisapos but the shear volume of closing down was insane. It usually took over an hour to record the dayaposs banking, ensure all food beyond its use by date had been thrown away, and to clean the entire place from top to bottom. I know it doesnapost sound a lot, but it certainly felt like it after a demoralising sht of dealing with complaints, rudeness and a high demand for a cheese bake. But one of the glorious delights at the end of the day was being able to take food home. Youaposd be really surprised at how much food was wasted. It was literally a tonne of pure sausage rolls and baguettes and sweets. But it was great to decide which food you wanted to take home. Sometimes Iaposd walk out of the building with about four of five bags of food. It was great to see my familyaposs face when I brought them something back. My time at Greggs was very short lived, the first lockdown in March  put an end to my time there. When I was asked to go back in August , I kindly declined the offer and handed in my notice. So looking back at it now, was it all really worth it  The kindest answer is no. Even by the time the first lockdown was imposed, I felt like a walking zombie. The long hours were particularly draining. Sometimes youaposd be working five days on sht patterns of  hour days which can be demanding. The pay was hovering very close to the national minimum wage of around £. at the time. So you canapost really complain and grumble as it was a job. The free food at the end of the day was amazing - evenit impacted my waist line. But what really tipped me over the edge was the rudeness of customers. And I still see the similar kind of rudeness today but in a dferent shop. People can be so thoughtless and insensitive as to how their actions might be devastating or impact another person. The abuse was unjustied and uncalled for. But the saying goesthere isnapost a reason to complain, someone will find a reason too. I loved the food, but I donapost think the experience of working in a Greggs was all it is cracked up to be.

Currently, double jabbed travellers have to take rapid lateral flow tests once they arrive home, adding extra expense to breaks away.But in a boost to the travel industry, as well as people suffering January blues, the tests could be ditched from next week, making it easier to take holidays, reports claim.The Cabinet’s “Covid O” committee is also set to discuss whether being fully vaccinated means having two jabs, or also having the booster. There are also discussions being held to make passenger locator forms easier to use. It comes as a study published on Friday said testing rules should be a ‘thing of the past’ for jabbed passengers.  Conducted by specialist consultants Oxera and Edge Health, the research shows Governments cannot react quickly enough to be effective against new iants of Covid. As a result, travel restrictions made in response to new discoveries do not help limit the spread, they argue.Airlines UK CEO Tim Alderslade said: “Testing restrictions for the fully vaccinated make no sense at all given the delay in Governments being able to detect and act on the arrival of a new iant, as we saw with Omicron. “This is something the World Health Organisation themselves have admitted. Not only do they fail to suppress the international spread of iants, they place a disproportionate burden on the travel sector and those that rely on the connectivity aviation provides. “We need to be smarter in how we deal with future iants rather than resorting to blanket but wholly ineffective measures. Otherwise we will never be able to truly say we are living with Covid.”Airlines UK and MAG, which owns Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports, are calling on Ministers to not only remove all remaining restrictions on international travel, but to reconsider their role in reacting to future iants of coronavirus. Brits looking to book holidays have plenty of options, with a number of countries open to UK holidaymakers including Greece, Portugal and Cyprus.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON World Health OrganisationCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When whispers broke that there was a traitor in the ranks, Elliott leapt to the defence of his pal. But this was no ordinary friendship. And his pal was playing him all along – as he did so many others. The chum  Kim Philby. Britain’s most notorious Cold War spy, responsible for the deaths of countless Western colleagues due to his leaked intelligence. Double-agent Philby had worked for the communists since he was . He used his position at MI, where he rose through the ranks, to benefit the former Soviet Union at the expense of Britain. Finally, after Elliott himself forced the truth in , Philby fled to join his KGB paymasters in Moscow. The womaniser would marry there – for the fourth time to Rufina Pukhova – and his adopted country even dedicated a stamp to him. Elliott was shattered and never recovered from his ally’s betrayal of Britain and their friendship. Now the relationship is the focus of new TV drama A Spy Among Friends, starring Damian Lewis as Elliott and Guy Pearce as the deceitful Philby. They have been filming in Romania and London. Director Nick Murphy said: “How could I resist the opportunity to dramatise the true story of spies and lelong friends, one of whom was betraying the other all along  “A friendship that resulted in the gutting of British and American intelligence at the height of the Cold War and shaped the field of play for the dangerous game against Russia we’re still trying to win today.” Philby’s biographer James Hanning said public schoolboys Elliott and Philby were from the same cloth. Friends for  years, they had a shared love for cricket and long lunches with a pink gin tipple.  Hanning said: “They had been in MI together for a long time. “Elliott was an old-school gent – his father was the headmaster of Eton, he was very straight, conventional and amusing. He was keen on schoolboy jokes – him and Philby did a lot of drinking and giggling and gossiping over dirty jokes. “They were very close. Elliott was younger than Philby and his protege in the war. He looked up to him. I am not sure he ever got over the embarrassment and shame of his deception. “Philby rang rings around him.” Damian Lewis, , says the drama is “an up-close look at friendship, a friendship blinded by love, class and membership to the right clubs and ended in betrayal and the deaths of thousands”. Pearce, , said he has always “been fascinated by the intriguing MI history”. And few spy tales get more intriguing than this. By the end of World War Two, Philby – codenamed “Sonny” by the Soviets – was head of counter-espionage operations for MI, responsible for combating Soviet subversion in Western Europe. In  he went to Washington as chief MI officer.  In secret, he revealed Allied intelligence to the USSR that the UK and US were planning to send units into communist-leaning Albania. The Americans grew increasingly suspicious, especially when traitors Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean fled to the USSR in  – after Philby tipped them off the net was closing in. The incident forced Philby’s resignation. He, Burgess and Maclean were part of the Cambridge Five spy ring – university contemporaries from the s. But MI spy-catchers failed to pin anything on Philby. Five years on, he landed a job as a journalist in Beirut and resumed his career as a Soviet spy. As MI gathered mounting evidence, a chastened Elliott volunteered to go to Beirut to confront the traitor himself. Their famous encounter in January  still remains shrouded in mystery. And although Elliott did get a written confession from his old pal, it was considered useless. Biographer Hanning said: “Elliott told his colleagues thatPhilby had any sense of shame and decency, the person he owed was him. Soanyone could get Philby to confess, it was him. It was quite emotional. Elliott said, ‘My God, I respected you, I hope you have the decency to know how much I hate you’.  “He was incredibly angry. He offered him an immunity dealPhilby would tell him who  was recruited. “He felt embarrassed in the eyes of the bosses and he thought he was most likely to get a deal out of him.” But Philby fled days later, with some suggesting MI wanted him to run to avoid a humiliating trial in the UK. According to Hanning’s book Love and Deception: Philby in Beirut, Elliott wrote a full account of his Lebanese trip, which was vetted by the intelligence services and never published.  Elliott’s son Mark confirmed: “Kim was as close a friend as my father ever had. “My father told me he had written an autobiography. He had to get approval from ‘The Office’ for its publication. This they would not give.” Elliott bitterly felt the betrayal until his death at the age of  in . As Philby reached the rank of colonel in the KGB in Russia – where he lived until his death at  in  – UK intelligence services gradually realised the names he had given Elliott were duds. Hanning believed Philby never had any true respect for his friend, deliberately calling him “Nick” to his we Eleanor, knowing he hated the abbreviation. Hanning said: “Philby outwitted him at every turn and the confession was worthless in the end. They never questioned Philby again. They never got the chance. Philby got away. I am not sure Elliott ever got over that.” A Spy Among Friends is expected to air on Britbox in the autumn.

Which is just as well as he’s NEVER going to find a new squeeze after the latest bedroom revelations. Not the sex abuse ones which, of course, Prince Andrew vehemently denies and still has a chance to defend himself in a US legal action. But in the court of public opinion he has been well and truly stuffed by the details of his cuddly toy fetish.A former servant has claimed that ­after his orce from Fergie in  Andrew kept a ­collection of  teddies and ­other ­animals lined up with ­military precision on his Buckingham Palace bed.Every night the maid had to move the heir bear bunch to set positions around the room so that they “looked pretty”. The small ones dressed in sailor unorms were ranked by size order in an unused fireplace and his two favourite bears sat on ickle thrones on either side of the bed. Then, in the morning, she had to put them all back again, using a diagram to ensure they were correctly positioned. Becauseso much as a whisker was out of place the Queen’s favourite son would scweam and scweam like a toddler having a tantrum.This all sounded so bizarre that I ­wonderedAndrew was going through some sort of post-orce breakdown at the time – especially as the maid says he also kept Fergie’s make-up on his dressing table and her wedding gown in the wardrobe. But another insider has claimed that Andrew STILL sleeps with a little gang of furry friends. And staff also keep a list of instructions showing where Heart-Holding Teddy sits and how Grey Hippo should be placed on the bed on top of a special green blankie.Crikey. I know that ­millions of grown men still cherish a childhood teddy. But Andrew’s menagerie would make most women run a mile. Because we all know there is something deeply dodgy about a bloke who keeps piles of soft toys on his bed. It suggests that he still sucks his thumb, likes wearing nappies and will want to call you Mummy while you dust his bottom with talcum powder. But I’m sure loyal Sarah is well used to Andy’s ‘Toy Story’ fantasies by now.

The Duke of York was married to Fergie for  years - and during that time still slept with around a dozen teddy bears on his bed, royal expert Ingrid Seward claimed. She recalled noticing the toys while visiting Fergie at Buckingham Palace in  to assist with the biography she was writing.The revelation comes after former Palace maid Charlotte Briggs revealed how she had to spend a whole day learning how the Duke liked the soft toys displayed on his bed during the s.Andrew and Fergie were married from  to , and share daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie together.  Remembering the teddies during her visit, Ingrid said she assumed they belonged to the Duchess, and were from her childhood.She told The Sun : I said to her, ‘Oh Fergie, you haven’t still got your old teddies have you  And she said, ‘No they are all Andrew’s’. We found it very funny and fell about laughing.” Former Palace maid Charlotte worked for the Royal Family in the mid-s, and claimed staff were given a diagram on how to place Andrewaposs  cuddly toys around his room. She said: “As soon as I got the job, I was told about the teddies and it was drilled into me how he wanted them. “I even had a day’s training. Everything had to be just right. It was so peculiar.” She added: “But he absolutely loved the ­teddies and was very clear about how he wanted them arranged.”  Charlotte, who was  at the time, said the biggest teddies were put at the back and the rest were in descending order of size to the smallest at the front. She claimed the Princeaposs two favourite teddies were placed on mahogany thrones at his bedside. She further added that the vast majority of teddies were dressed as sailors, in unorms and caps, and came from all over the world. Charlotte even claimed Andrew frequently lost his temper with the staff, especiallyit involved his cuddly toys.  She added: It took me half an hour to arrange them — most bizarre thing to be paid for. Andrew lives with ex-we Fergie at the Royal Lodge in Windsor, but a suite of rooms was kept for him at the Palace for overnight stays. It is understood his Palace bedroom has been packed up and his teddy collection has been scaled back.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Alex FergusonSarah FergusonPrincess BeatricePrince Andrew, Duke of YorkBuckingham PalaceMarriageRoyal FamilyToysBears\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The pair stepped back as senior members of the royal family in .And it has now been claimed this would be a catastrophic blow for Harry, who it emerged last year has relinquished his royal patronages.Being removed, by parliament no less, as a Counsellor of State would really be the nail in Harry’s coffin of his former le as a frontline member of the royal family, a source told the Daily Mail. If the Queen does take steps to have this situation remedied and Harry is axed, there really is no going back. All of these decisions – the military titles, the HRHs in abeyance – could theoretically be reversed. However, having parliament take formal action to remove them as Counsellors of State is in another league entirely.

In , the Queenaposs father King George VI created the Regency Act which decided the Counsellors of States in their current model.

They attend royal engagements and travel the world on tours, meeting thousands of people every year. But sometimes, when a royal is starting to fall out of favour, they may do other bits and bobs in a bid to win fans over - with dfering levels of success. In June , Prince Edward, who organised the event, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Fergie went head-to-head in a special episode of Itaposs a Royal Knockout. Each royal had a team, which was representing a dferent charity, made up of celebrities, including the late Meat Loaf, who competed in a number of dferent events.However, it didnapost go quite as they hoped and has since been described as a disaster from start to finish and one of the biggest c***-ups in the royal familyaposs history. Royal expert Ben Pimlott claims the Queen didnapost like the idea at all and all of her staff believed it would be a mistake. An insider told him: [The Queen] was against it, but one of her faults is that she canapost say no. Recalling the show on Channel aposs Fergie Vs Diana:Royal Wives at War, royal expert Jennie Bond said: Itaposs a Royal Knockout will go down in royal history as one of the biggest c**k-ups of all time I think. It was a disaster from beginning to end, it was absolutely humiliating. Sarah with her usual gusto entered into it, andshe gets into something she does it with bells on. However not all of the royal family took up the offer of taking part.  Speaking on the documentary, the Daily Mailaposs Richard Kay said: Diana famously didnapost take part, neither did Charles. He thought it was something that was beneath them. In a way, itaposs kind of unfair, Fergie took a lot of the blame, almost the scapegoat. Her behaviour was being commented on and I think, then, is when Diana came into her own. The show, which was filmed at Alton Towers, was hosted by Stuart Hall, Les Dawson and Su Pollard. Paul Daniels acted as the chief referee. Princess Anneaposs red team, raising cash for Save the Children, included Tom Jones, Clf Richard, actress Jenny Agutter, and athlete Deborah Flintoff. Fergie was joined by Michael Brandon, Ben Cross and Jane Seymour, while Prince Andrewaposs World Wildle Team included Gary Lineker, Margot Kidder, Rhys Jones and John Travolta. Meat Loaf, who passed away this week, also took part. Prince Edward was in charge of the yellow team, raising cash for the Duke of Edinburgh Scheme. Among the celebs on his team were John Cleese, Eddie Grant, Peter Blake and Christopher Reeve. More than million people turned into watch it, making it the fourth most watched show of the year.

The former college student, from Highfields, South Yorkshire, had been studying law with dreams of going to university and becoming a lawyer - but they were crushed overnight when she was diagnosed with Chiari Malformation.The condition, which causes ligaments in the spine to be tense and tighter than usual, sees the brain tissue of its victims pulled into their spinal cord and can eventually lead to paralysis. It can lead to so-called internal decapitation, when the ligaments that connect the skull to the spine are severed. Petried by the prognosis, Allesha has opted not to be told by doctors how long she has before this happens. Have you got an inspiring story to tell  Email webnews@mirror She said: “This condition has ruined my le. I had dreams of becoming a lawyer and going to university but I can’t go anymore. “I spend every day confined in my room in complete darkness because I can’t bear the light. “I find the smallest noises excruciatingly painful, even when someone is talking to me I have to ask them to whisper. “When they told me what would eventually happen to me I just broke down. “I asked them not to tell me how long I had based on my scans because I just don’t think I can handle knowing. I feel like a walking death sentence.”Allesha, who lives with her sister and was diagnosed by an NHS doctor in September , is not eligible for surgery on the health service.The teen took matters into her own hands when she claimed that teachers and doctors refused to accept she was really suffering.  Allesha said: “It wasnapost until  that I started getting these horrible headaches. “I have had migraines before but I knew that these weren’t migraines because I could physically feel the back of my head shocking me. “It started out as once a week but then it got to the point where it was everyday, all day. “I took myself to the doctors and I was desperately trying to get people to believe me and listen to me. “I felt like I was being treated like a child, which I know I am but I also know my own body “Eventually one GP finally listened to me and I was referred for an MRI and to a neurosurgeon. “He told me I had Chiari Malformation but never really explained what it was or what that meant.” After researching Chiari Malformation, Allesha discovered a clinic in Barcelona who are offering a new kind of surgery which promises to eliminate the condition for its victims altogether. In the UK, surgeons use a method called decompression surgery whereby a piece of bone is removed from the spinal cord to relieve the pressure - but there is a risk that the tension will build up again causing the same problem in future. At the Filum System clinic, Spanish doctors say their minimally invasive technique allows them ‘eliminate the root cause and stop further progression of the condition’.  But the costly procedure will set back Allesha £, who has now set up a GoFundMe to cover the procedure and medical expenses.Allesha said: “I suffer with crippling back pain and neck pain, sickness and fatigue. “Before this started I was about to start volunteering in a law firm and I was at college but I had to quit. “From the very beginning I have been dealing with this by myself. “To get this surgery and have my le back would mean everything, I just want to be alive.”The NHS was approached for comment.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSBack painTeenagersPeople\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Annie Gresham, , had a history of mental illness and was diagnosed with anorexia and emotionally unstable personality disorder . In November, she took a highly toxic chemical which is illegally sold as a weight-reduction product despite being not licensed for humans. An inquest at Derby Coroner’s Court was told Annie was found in her pyjamas on a bridge overlooking the A where she told ambulance crews to leave her as she was dying anyway. She later told staff she had taken an overdose of the drug and, despite the work of medics at the hospital, she died the same night. In a statement her family accused the system of failing their daughter. They said: Annie Greshamwas a much loved daughter, sister, auntie and friend. She was intelligent, caring, beautul, and had an amazing sense of humour. We miss her every day.  We would like to express our sincere thanks to the police, ambulance service and staff at the Royal Derby Accident and Emergency department. We had frequent contact with all three organisations, and their professionalism, care and compassion have been amazing throughout. We cannot thank them enough. Annie received compassionate care from many iniduals in the mental health sector over the years and for this we are truly grateful. What we would like to happen is for the iniduals who worked with Annie to examine their decisions and actions, and question whether with hindsight, they would do things dferently. Then to remember this next time, for the next patient and their family. In addition we hope that professionals and people in a position of power will challenge the level of care for mental health in this country. In our opinion the system failed Annie and will continue to fail others unless there is a drastic change. Peter Nieto, area coroner for Derby and Derbyshire, recorded a narrative conclusion as there was no indication Annie had planned to take her own le. He said: “It was clear she had consciously taken the tablets on  November. That canapost have occurred accidentally. But she must have known that there was a high likelihood that she would have been seen and therefore she would likely have then been taken to hospital, where she would have received some treatment. Had she taken herself somewhere private, then I think the case would be dferent.” A note was found after Annie died but the coroner said it did not contain any suicidal content - although it could be interpreted as a farewell note. Mr Nieto added: “I hope the inquest has been of some help in some way and I give my condolences to you for Annieaposs death at such a young age.

And February looks set to be a turbulent mix of wet and windy conditions with more freezing and snowy conditions creeping in at times. Mr Hammond added: There are signs of a more lively start to February - it looks wetter and windier at times than for much of the previous month.We may see colder weather start to make more definite inroads from the north through the early days of the new month, turning some of that rain to snow.Maps for WXCharts show that temperatures are set to drop to sub zero around January  and the first week of February is expected to see heavy snow fall. On February  the mercury could fall to as low as -C in Scotland while there could be up to cm of snow in the far north west of the UK. In England there could be up to eight centimetres falling in Manchester.  Given these expected weather conditions, the UK Health Security Agency has urged people to check neighbours are safe, especially in parts of England which will experience their coldest temperatures of the winter so far. Agostinho Sousa, a consultant at the agency, said: Cold weather can have a serious impact on health, particularly for older people and those with heart and lung problems, as it increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections.  Remind vulnerable relatives and neighbours to heat their home to at least C - particularlythey have reduced mobility, are  or older, or have a health condition. Should they need to go outside, itaposs important for them to wear shoes with a good grip. The Met Office has forecast snow in the UK for the beginning of February, saying: High pressure is expected to be near or across the UK to start with, before gradually declining southwards further into February.  This means that, especially at first, the generally settled conditions will prevail with bright or sunny spells. There is still the increased likelihood of frost and fog, the fog lingering all day in places. Later in February, it is likely to turn more changeable in the north, with outbreaks of rain and stronger winds. There is an increased chance of these pushing further south at times, though settled conditions are most likely to persist here.  Temperatures are expected to be slightly above average overall, particularly in the north. Some colder interludes are still likely though, bringing a risk of occasional snow, most likely over northern hills. However for today, Sunday January , Met Office forecaster, Alex Deakin said there will be breaks in the cloud so some sunshine is possible for some parts. He added: Temperatures will get up to C or C a little higherwe do see any spells of sunshine coming through.

Christina Darling, , has been charged with aggravated harassment and menacing, both as hate crimes, and acting in a manner that could injure a child. It is alleged she approached the children outside an Orthodox synagogue in New York City last Friday and yelled the offensive slur. Darling also spat at the oldest sibling, an eight-year-old boy, police say. The authorities say the other children are aged seven and two. Hitler should have killed you all,’ Darling allegedly told the kids. I’ll kill you and know where you live.  Surveillance video captures the defendant, a psychology student, appearing to shout at the youngsters. It shows Darling, wearing an orange sweatshirt, walking on a New York City street and then approaching the siblings. It then captures Darling leave back towards where she came from. The incident was reported to police, who investigated and confirmed the charge on Twitter yesterday. The tweet said the charge was made possible thanks to help from the public.  Aryah Fried, the siblingsapos father, said: I would hope that she understands the severity of what she did. To do it to anybody is obviously problematic but for an adult to do it to a child is beyond crazy. We also teach our kids to look out for people that look like moms when they feel unsafe. And this woman looks like a person that might have been a safe looking person for the kids. So, what do we tell them now A petition has been created by fellow students at St. Francis College calling for Darlingaposs expulsion. The petition is live on Change.org.It reads: I urge President Miguel Martinez-Saenz to stand by his promises and denounce this horrying act of racism, bigotry, and harassment against the Jewish people. If appropriate disciplinary action isnapost taken, an egregious precedent will be set.

Many fans were surprised at the fact that Alex seemed to have forgotten her shoes, with many tweeting out about their confusion, but host Bradley Walsh seemed unfazed. What do you think of Alexaposs unusual outfit choice  Let us know in the comments...One viewer said: Is that woman on the chase not wearing shoes  How has she forgotten her shoes ! observed another fan, while a third person said: Looks like she has no shoes on, that’s very strange. I hope Alex wins some money, she needs to get herself some shoes, a fourth social media user joked. A fth shocked fan commented: How on earth can you just forget your shoes  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. Alex answered seven questions correctly, which earned her £, to take through to the next round. Bradley welcomed Alex up to the podium and she explained that she would use her prize money to take her husband to Mauritius, where they went on their honeymoon. Along with two of her teammates, Alex made it through to the final chase, but they were unsuccessful in defeating the beast, Mark Labbett, and walked away empty-handed.Meanwhile, Ben Shephard was left in stitches when a contestant on TV game show Tipping Point thought that the Loch Ness monster was a type of snake. The host of the ITV gameshow struggled to contain himself after he asked for the name of a breed of snake native to Britain thataposs a member of the viper family.Would-be winner Josh, a student from Manchester, was confident he knew the answer and hit his buzzer first - but when the camera turned to him he blurted out the Loch Ness monster. Ben, who used to front Channel Fouraposs Bigger Breakfast, stled a laugh that soon broke through and he was struggling to regain composure as he told Josh that he was, unfortunately, incorrect.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

By doing it this way, the bacon should caramelise, making it crispier and giving the meat a punchier flavour.He explained: I find that the best way to cook bacon is on a medium to high heat pan with a small amount of natural fat, searing it on each side for a minute or so.If the bacon is properly dry-cured and cut to a nice thickness, it should caramelise on the edges. The fat will then render without dissolving, resulting in delicious flavour.The chef, who works with online butchery retailer Farmison  Co also shared another top tip - but itaposs pretty controversial.He continued to say that he doesnapost think you should add any condiments to your bacon, so wave goodbye to ketchup or brown sauce.Do you have a food or cooking hack to share  We want to hear all about it. Email us at yourmirror@mirror In my opinion,cooked this way the bacon won’t need any sauce to enhance the taste - it’ll be perfect as it is, he said. The chef also claimed weaposve been making similar mistakes when cooking curry as well. Apparently, we should be heating the spices in oil before cooking to intensy the flavours. To ‘temper’ your spices means to heat them up in oil to bring out their flavours, he explained. It’s a simple, quick step that reaps rewards when it comes to enhancing your dish and intensying the flavours from the spices. Once you start doing this, you’ll really notice the dference, and it’ll just become part of the curry cooking process.

Now I fully disagree and so did my family and my aunt. My girlfriend was admittedly dressed slightly less conservative than the other women but I wouldn’t call what she was wearing immodest at all. I told my girlfriend and asked hershe would dress more conservatively next time.  Earlier this week, ahead of this monthaposs dinner, the man asked his girlfriend to show him what she planned to wear for the family gathering this weekend, and when she did, he was disappointed. Again, it wasn’t immodest, but just less conservative and I know it’d p*** my grandmother off again. She said no, as she really liked the dress and it was modest. I told her that what’s modest to her isn’t going to be what’s modest to a -year-old woman andshe wanted to buy a dress I’d pay for it, but she refused. The couple continued to argue and in the end, he told his girlfriend thatshe refused to change her dress it would be better for her to just not come this month and they can find a solution for next time. She told me I was being unreasonable and putting an old woman’s outdated views over her freedom, but I feel like I was being very reasonable, the man added, before turning to Reddit to hear their opinions on the matter. If you want a future with somebody, stand up for them instead of just obliging by your familyaposs opinions. If your grandma is judging her because she doesnapost want to wear a potato sack, thataposs on grandma, one Reddit user suggested. However, another disagreed: Itaposs your grandmotheraposs home and invite and she has one requirement. I get it her body, her choice but what the younger generation of today needs to get a grip with is you need to pick your God damn battles because fighting a dress war with an elderly grandma who probably wonapost be around much longer is ridiculous. Your grandmother is never ever ever going to understand this hard line. She just wonapost. Your fiance is being childish. Dammit, suck it up and wear an faposin modest dress for a couple of hours.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

And heaposs also discovered the four-word phrase that all delivery drivers absolutely hate. Heaposs turned his experiences into a book, From Hollywood to Cricklewood: Delivering during a Pandemic. You have a unique window into someone’s le - it’s humbling, funny, sad, frustrating and a real privilege, he told The Sun.One time a man in his eighties answered the door wearing rubber gloves, a face mask, a transparent apron and old flip flops held onto his feet by parcel tape – and nothing . I didn’t quite know where to look. But for Paul, the worst part of the job is checking a customeraposs delivery details and seeing a certain phrase. He said: When you find it’s up four floors with no lt and you have  trays of food your heart sinks - I do dread the words, “th Floor, No Lt. The same thing happens with water - gallons of it.

In a highly unusual move, the Foreign Office levelled the accusation at Putin as he considers whether to mount an invasion against Russiaaposs neighbour.It took the unusual step of naming former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev as a potential Kremlin candidate to take over the Ukrainian government in Kyiv in a Russian pupper regime. British officials also named four former Ukrainian ministers suspected of colluding with Russian intelligence officers on a plan to attack Ukraine.What do you make of the Foreign Officeaposs move  Have your say in the comment sectionThe move comes as Western allies stepped up warnings that Russia will pay a heavy pricethe estimated , troops massed on the border launch any kind of incursion into Ukraine. And UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned his fellow European Union leaders against naivetyover Putin’s Ukraine demands, as reported by the .In a statement, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the Russian plotting showed the s to which the Kremlin was prepared go to undermine the government in Kyiv.  The information being released today shines a light on the extent of Russian activity designed to subvert Ukraine, and is an insight into Kremlin thinking, she said. Russia must de-escalate, end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy. As the UK and our partners have said repeatedly, any Russian military incursion into Ukraine would be a massive strategic mistake with severe costs.  Mr Murayev, a media owner, lost his seat in the Ukrainian parliament when his party failed to secure % of the vote in elections in . He has reportedly spoken out in the past in support of Russiaaposs annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in . In addition, the Foreign Office named four other Ukrainian politicians who, it said, maintained links with the Russian intelligence services.  It said some of them had been in contact with Russian intelligence officers working on the invasion plan. They include Mykola Azarov who served as prime minister under the pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych who was toppled in a popular uprising in . Mr Azarov fled to Russia where he established what was widely seen as a puppet government-in-exile. He has been the subject of international sanctions and an Interpol red notice issued at the request of the Ukrainian government.  Also in the list is Vladimir Sivkovich, the former deputy head of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, who was this week made the subject of US sanctions for allegedly working with Russian intelligence. The others are Serhiy Arbuzov and Andriy Kluyev who both served as deputy prime minister under Mr Yanukovych. Bois Johnson is said to consider the crisis as gravely dangerous and warned his European counterparts against naivety over the demanded conditions Putin has set on any Russian de-escalation of the situation, which include a ban on Ukraine joining Nato.  Germanyaposs navy chief stepped down on Saturday after drawing criticism for saying Putin deserved respect and that Kyiv would never win back annexed Crimea from Moscow. Vice Admiral Kay-Achim Schoenbach said Putin seeks to be treated as an equal by the West. What hereally wants is respect, Schoenbach said. And my God, giving someone respect is low cost, even no cost... It is easy to give him the respect he really demands - and probably also deserves. Schoenbach added that the Crimea peninsula is gone, it will never come back, this is a fact, contradicting the joint Western position that Moscowaposs annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine in  cannot be accepted and must be reversed.A Downing Street source told the: “The Prime Minister’s view is that the situation in Ukraine is the biggest test to the unity and resolve of the West and the Nato alliance in decades. “It would be frankly naive to assume that Russia could be mollied by changes to the European security architecture – the Kremlin’s behaviour has made that consistently clear. “The UK is working through Nato and in lockstep with the US to enact a policy of dialogue and deterrence, pursuing the diplomatic track but readying a package of sanctions that will pierce the heart of Russia’s economy should that fail. Britain has sent troops and defence weapons to Ukraine and on Saturday it was reported Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has accepted an invite to London to meet Defence Secretary Ben Wallace.A senior defence source said: The Defence Secretary is glad that Russia has accepted the invitation to talk with his counterpart. Given the last defence bilateral between our two countries took place in London in , Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has offered to meet in Moscow instead.  The Secretary of State has been clear that he will explore all avenues to achieve stability and a resolution to the Ukraine crisis. We are in communication with the Russian government. More than , Russian troops, as well as equipment including tanks, were moved to the Ukrainian border this week.This week President Joe Biden warned he believes an attack is ‘imminent’, although he was criticised for hinting any response would depend on the severity.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Foreign OfficeMykola AzarovSergei ShoiguLiz TrussBen WallaceJoe BidenViktor YanukovychVladimir PutinPoliticsUkraine crisisRussia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The space agency had planned to fly its Ingenuity helicopter over the Martian surface on January , before inclement weather forced them to abandon plans.NASAaposs satellite, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, captured an image above the red planet showing a large regional dust cloud stretching from the southern to northern hemispheres. It covered the area where NASAaposs Perseverance Rover - the craft that transported Ingenuity - is operating. The air became too dense, meaning that insufficient sunlight would have reached the small experimental chopperaposs solar . On January , NASA wrote of the grounded flight: The presence of this storm came quite early – even before the dusty season traditionally starts! In fact, we have never seen a storm of this strength so early in the Mars year before. Flight  will now take off no later than Sunday, the space agency confirmed.  NASA says weather forecasting on our neighbouring planet has become an integral part of Martian flight planning. The red planet has a much thinner atmosphere to Earthaposs, but there are some key similarities. Both worlds have seasons, changing winds, ice clouds, and dust storms, among others, NASA says. To forecast on an alien world, the Perseverance Rover contains the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer- an operating weather station that can calculate the air density and track and measure winds through the day.  The helicopter has now flown  times since its first launch in April last year. The .kg helicopter was carried to the red planet by the space agencyaposs Perseverance rover. It weighs a mere .kg on Mars because of the red planet’s lower gravity. It is armed with two rotors that spin in opposite directions to lt the drone off the ground. The helicopter has to fly through the challenges of lower gravity and the Martian atmosphere, which is around  times thinner than Earthaposs. The space agency previously called the first flight a “Wright brothers moment” and even attached a stamp-sized piece of the aviation pioneers’  plane wing to Ingenuity. NASAaposs distant satellite, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, recently captured a sizeable regional dust storm on the Red Planet, encompassing the area where the space agencyaposs Perseverance rover is investigating the Martian surface.

It’s dficult being a young manager and I explained to him that he has to use the experience he picked up as a player and take things from managers that he played under. I know he has worked for some very good managers, but he has to look at how they dealt with things and decided which he liked and which he didn’t like.“Him and Steveare very dferent characters although both have tempers and both have the ability to look after people so either one could be the good cop or the bad cop.“Jimmy is one of the funniest characters in Scottish football but now he will have to become a disciplinarian at times.“We spoke for over an hour on the phone last week and I was delighted to learn that he had been appointed manager of Gala Fairydean Rovers and had brought Stevein as his assistant.“They were both great for me at Ross County and were part of a really good group of players and I’m sure that they have what’s needed to be a success in the Borders.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-trio-hogg-sutherland-darcy-scotland-squad","story":"There is a strong Borders contingent in Gregor Townsend’s -man squad for the upcoming Guinness Six Nations ties.Stuart Hogg continues as captain and is joined in the squad by fellow Hawick pair Rory Sutherland and Darcy Graham.Boston born Rufus McLean who started his rugby journey with Melrose Minis is also in the squad along with ex-Melrose and Southern Knights flanker Rory Darge.Bath centre Cameron Redpath, son of ex-Scotland and Melrose scrum-half Bryan Redpath, s after missing out in recent games due to injury.The squad will meet up at Oriam on Monday  January for a training camp before reconvening the following week ahead of the Calcutta Cup clash.Scotland Head Coach Townsend said: “When you look through the squad this is the most competitive I’ve seen it in so many areas and that’s testament to the strength and depth we have.“We are able to call-up several new players into the squad such as Andy Christie, Kyle Rowe and Ben White.

The conclusion we’ve come it is that we are not going to get to the bottom of this till we talk to the people themselves, the kids who are getting involved in this and that’s where we are putting our effort at the moment.“We have secured the assistance of the local high school who are going to work with us on this, maybe through focus groups and with a little bit of talk perhaps we can find a solution.”Sergeant David Rourke said: “I don’t have all the answers and I’ll not pretend that I do. I wish I did, but I certainly believe what we need to do is engage the children and youths of the communities a lot better.“So what we’ve been trying to do is work in partnership with the high schools, the community council in Peebles and ious other organisations such as Youth Action Teams to address and ert the youth’s attentions from vandalisms such as what has happened in the play park to more productive activities around the region.“Generally when we have vandalism or any sort of crime we have feedback such as ‘where were the police’ or ‘what are the police doing to resolve this ’“The police cannot resolve this on their own. Resourcing levels as we know across the board in the UK as a whole means we cant have police officers on every street corner every minute of the day to prevent crime happening so what we need to do is work as communities to spot it happening in the first place.”.removeA number of groups in the area have also stepped up to help.Lori Lee from the Community Sports Hub said: “We’ve been working hard to try and get sport back up on the table and that’s something during COVID we have been unable to do. So the opportunity hasn’t been there for young people to get out and be active in sport and potentially this is a reason behind anti-social behaviour.”And Dave Hodson from Tweeddale Youth Action added: “Through our youth clubs in Peebles and Innerleithen we continue to offer activities and opportunities for young people to have fun. We offer a place where young people can access support, advice and where we can signpost further services.“And really through volunteering opportunities we try and foster a sense of community spirit within our young people.“It’s important to say as well that the vast majority of our young people do play an active role in community le and are fantastic.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-men-admit-jedburgh-high-street-clothing-shop-raid","story":"BACKGROUND reports have been ordered into two Borders men following a raid on a Borders clothing store.Thirty-year-old Andrew Clamp, of Hawick, pleaded guilty to a charge of theft by housebreaking at the premises of David Thomson  Son outfitters in High Street, Jedburgh, on November , .He also admitted the theft of a vehicle.Co-accused Scott Shearman, , pleaded guilty to the reset of shirts, jumpers, coats and jeans stolen from the shop which were found at his home in Howdenbank, Hawick, on November .He also admitted obstructing police and instructing his dog to attack a police officer.:Anti-vaccine group hack Scottish Borders Councils Twitter accountJedburgh Sherf Court was told that the dog bit Shearman on his arm instead.The court also heard that £, worth of clothing was stolen in the Jedburgh shop raid with £ worth of clothing recovered.Sentence was deferred until February  for the production of a Criminal Justice Social Work Report.Clamp also admitted assaulting two men with a metal pole on August  last year in Wellfield Road, Hawick.

Instead, it is based on the evidence-based, historical fact of Jesus# resurrection: #[God] has given us … hope# – a Bible term for #certainty# – #through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.# Because Jesus is alive, bodily, physically and in real time and space raised from death, we can have certainty even in these uncertain times in which we live."},{"url":null,"title":"gateway to gigha project a step closer to completion","story":"Isle of Gigha Heritage Trust launched the Gateway to Gigha project, which is now well under way, after securing £, from the Low Carbon Travel and Transport Fund and the National Lottery Heritage Fund.The new paths have opened access for residents and visitors to sites of interest including beaches and viewpoints that have previously been either dficult to get to or completely inaccessible.The project is also improving access to and knowledge and education about the numerous historic monuments on the island, through on-site informative installations that complement the landscape, online interpretation and events and community engagement to restore and protect its heritage features.The work is being delivered in three phases, with the first one focusing on hardcore paths suitable for walkers and cyclists.The first phase is expected to be finished ahead of the island celebrating its th anniversary of community ownership on March  .Work is due to begin shortly on the second phase which is mainly trod paths across the island that will benefit from upgraded drainage and way marking, as well as stepping-stones and interpretation points.The second phase will also provide easy access through Achamore Gardens where the existing paths have become overgrown, making the -acre public garden more accessible to everyone.Part of the development includes the launch of a new #Visit Gigha# website and social channels which will provide information on walking and cycle routes, as well as all the other things to see, do and explore whilst on the island.Local businesses will also be spotlighted, ensuring visitors are well informed on everything Gigha has to offer before their visit.The #Visit Gigha# brand is due to launch in the spring ahead of the newly-built campsite opening.The island is opening its first official camp and motorhome site which will have camping pitches, motorhome hook-up points and new showers, toilets and washing up areas.The new site is close to the ferry slip which complements the Gateway to Gigha project aims to reduce vehicle use on the island and reduce Gigha#s carbon footprint.Gigha has a narrow single-track road which becomes congested, particularly in the visitor season, making it dficult and often dangerous for road users to commute across the island.Therefore, the Isle of Gigha Heritage Trust intends to promote the use of the path network and close proximity of the campsite to the ferry to encourage visitors to leave their car behind and explore the island by foot, bike or on one of their  new ebikes which will be available to hire from the island#s activity centre.The activity centre is due to open in April and will offer day hire of bikes as well as water sport hires in summer."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts talented daria wins orchestra place","story":"Daria Derevyankin, who started playing the violin when she was seven years old, was selected following a rigorous audition.The NYOS has been providing young instrumentalists in Scotland with unforgettable training and performance experiences since .Aged just , Daria has already played with a number of folk bands, including Na Smeòraich, which was asked to play at events at Stonefield Castle, Mull of Kintyre Music Festival – the Dalriada Connections concert and the Beinn an Tuirc Gaelic concert – and was a supporting act at a recent Eddi Reader gig in Tarbert.The band also won ious competitions, including the under- folk group competitions at the Dalriada, Oban and Mull regional Mòds.Daria still loves playing folk and Gaelic music, but her real passion lies in classical music, which is why she is so delighted to have been offered a NYOS place.Aside from the fact there are few opportunities to play classical music in the Tarbert area, Daria#s success is all the more remarkable because all her lessons have been online since her teacher, Susan Rhodes, moved back to the Netherlands last year.#This is such a fantastic opportunity for a young and extremely talented musician, who can turn her hand to any style of music with ease,# said Susan.#I#m delighted she has gained a place in the NYOS.

Bestselling author, podcaster and speaker Emma Gannon is a self-confessed internet addict – but thinks we need get our humanity back and treat people better online, instead of constantly focusing on \"scaling\" or \"growing\" our followers.\"We used to compare ourselves with our neighbours. Now, we compare ourselves with everyone,\" Gannon observes. \"Its very confusing to work out what you want to do with your le.\"Gannon, who has a combined following of more than , on Twitter and Instagram, has written Disconnected: How To Stay Human In An Online World, which explores how people have become immersed in the digital world and how we need to remind ourselves of \"hope, humanity and heart\", reconnecting with our human selves, rather than our social media personas.It follows her first book, Ctrl Alt Delete: How I Grew Up Online, published in her late s, when she charted her internet experiences as a millennial born in the same year as the World Wide Web.Now , after further research and seeing whats happening to her and her friends and their relationship with the internet, she felt it was time for another book. \"Theres research now to back up theories that our memories are stronger when we are in the present moment. I look back now at huge gaps in my le when I cant really remember much because everything is through a screen, a photo, or through me packaging it up as an Instagram post.\"The digital world has become more toxic in the five years since her first book, she agrees. \"We used to think online and offline were two separate beings, when actually a lot of our behaviour on the internet is seeping into real le.\"Online toxicity can result in us becoming more anxious and aggressive to each other, she notes. \"Peoples fuses are shorter now. Weve also just spent two years online. We were just turning into people behind screens, which takes away our humanity.\"Many of her friends with big followings are leaving social media, she points out. \"The irony is that when you attract popularity for being yourself, you then attract the negative side, people not liking you, and then you water yourself down so you dont become yourself at all. The other side is that people are just becoming bored with it. We feasted on it and read the entire internet before bed, but I think we are just fatigued. Every time you swipe down to refresh your feed, its like a slot machine.\"Gannon admits that she was – and still is – addicted to the internet. \"It seems too strong a word – and maybe its not quite right because its not a substance that were consuming – but the withdrawal symptoms of needing to be by my phone, this idea of needing that hit of dopamine in the mornings, I could tell from a young age that I was more obsessed with the internet than a lot of my friends.\"Now, she says she has a great relationship with the online world, thanks in part to the mini prompts she has created for herself. \"The book is a mini daily prompt: Are you getting glazed-over eyes  Are you feeling physically anxious when you are scrolling  Ive become really aware of my physical self and how I need to take more breaks and the power of being compassionate to yourself.\"Gannon advises readers to \"work on [their] digital hygiene\" – a phrase she likens to \"clearing out your fridge of all the mouldy bits\" a kind of \"Marie Kondo technique of removing things that dont bring you joy\".\"Im following interiors accounts I like and people who inspire me,\" she says. \"Look through your list at who you are following and mute themnecessary. When you mute someone, they dont even know, so its about taking back control.\"\"Have a reason to pick up your phone,\" she suggests. \"Am I texting back a friend  Do I need to do a food shop  Do I need to send an email  Its an active thing, not a passive scroll, which is what a lot of people find themselves doing. We call it doomscrolling.\"Gannon recommends having separate personal and public Instagram accounts, one for her friends and family, the other for business. \"A lot of people my age have made the internet their job over the last decade, which has come with amazing positives. But the downside is, why would I want to share every aspect of my le with strangers  Its nice to have a little private space for you and your loved ones.\"\"Change your notications\" is another suggestion. \"I was getting pinged every time my cousin was texting me something I really didnt need to look at in that moment,\" she says. \"Prioritising what I need to look at and what I dont has changed everything for me. Im a big fan of aeroplane mode, which means no-one can get through and youre not having everything come in.\"Setting digital boundaries can also help. \"Put on an out of office, not just for email, but also in your WhatsApp where you can set an automated response,\" she suggests. \"Dont reply straight away. We live in this urgency [environment] in thatsomeone doesnt get a response in a day, they think youre dead. Its about setting that boundary.\"\"Make sure youre not getting every single notication,\" she adds. \"I dont get any now on social media. I just go on there when I want to to seeIve got any new messages.\"Gannon wants us to question our e-personalities. \"Are you doing something because you think it looks good, or because you feel good \" she asks. \"Sometimes people take a new job or go on a holiday because they think of the Instagram posts. One study by Expedia found that young people now book a holiday based on how Instagrammable it is. Take a moment to think how much it is impacting you.\"Not that she wants us to be too hard on ourselves. \"Sometimes I just want to sit in front of the TV and scroll on my phone for a bitIve had a rubbish day,\" she admits. \"Just be aware how much you are using it and slowly make your own changes.\"One idea is to reach out to people you havent spoken to in ages. \"They may be people who you might find you are having quite shallow relationships with online, sending each other emojis or likes every now and again.

When he resigned in May  opinion polling suggested that support stood at a comparable .%, being approximately the same when Theresa May took up the post.On her resignation and replacement by Boris Johnson, support had risen to .%. During his premiership, support has been as low as .%, though it has been as high as % in October .In other words, any connection between Boris Johnson being Prime Minster and support for independence is no more than the continuation of a trend, with iations around it, that has developed not just under Mr Johnson but successive Westminster prime ministers since at least . Of course, whether this will remain so, only time will tell.What is clear is that Mr Redfern will leave no stone unturned, or barrel unscraped in his never-ending loathing of the very idea of independence. Perhaps the reason is that despite the increasingly desperate attempts by Mr Redfern and his fellow travellers, the independence argument not only has increasingly deep foundations, but is increasing its support in parts of the community who would previously have voted No.It is no wonder that they are worried, but they do themselves no favours by the kind of superficial, and easily disproved statistics that Mr Redfern used this week.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.THE BUCK STOPS AT THE TOPI READ last weeks issueand noted the big dference in the way that Iain Macwhirter and Barrie Cunning saw things. Mr Macwhirterseemed to mostly blame the civil service and Mr Cunningseemed to mostly blame Boris Johnson for the culture of Partygate.I am apolitical in general, with no particular party affiliation, but it seems to me that Mr Cunning has the vast majority of public opinion on his side and Mr Macwhirter very little, however right he may be about the civil service in general.The buck stops at the top, and usually the culture on any ship or in any organisation is dictated from the top. The captain.To mix my metaphors the fish rots from the head, and that’s what is happening here with Westminster and Partygate. Rotten with hypocrisy and corruption.Its high time we did something about it.George Archibald, West Linton.SHAME ON THE WESTMINSTER CHARLATANSTHE charlatans and dandies at Westminster have shredded the European freedom and citizenship of  million Britons so that a few billionaires could feast on the wreckage of the pound sterling abandoned our allies among the Afghan people to the revenge of savage enemies wish to push the resulting refugees back into the sea have made Britain so global she can’t sell a crate of oysters further away than Dover, and stripped British business of willing help from European labourers, yet the public are dangerously annoyed as never yet because those chancers indulge themselves in a country which is under restrictions, with many sick, dying, or bereaved.While the leisure behaviour of these great helmsmen is tactless and stupid, and while they have criminally risked their lives and their staff’s lives, none of that is anything like the disgrace of their programme of misrule.Tim Cox, Bern, Switzerland.THE CASE AGAINST GREEN BELTSI NOTE with interest your report on objections to the proposed development between Airdrie and Calderbank. Many objections to this and other projects in semi-rural areas springs from an understandable but mistaken view that so-called green belts are about nature conservation.When they were first mooted in the s there was scant interest in this and their widespread use has not stopped a huge reduction in the extent of natural meadows, woodland and hedgerows and in bioersity due to modern farming. Indeed it is said that there is now more wildle within towns than in parts of the countryside.The role of green belts was and is to manage urban growth. The proper term is a \"container\". Instead of allowing most expansion on parts of the urban periphery this is pushed into outlying towns and villages, which greatly raises public costs and the amount of time and money spent on travel. House prices within cities are unaffordable for many, and villages become detached suburbs.Another aim is to make infrastructure provision more economic by limiting the amount of land available for building in one period . When most of this is used parts of the green belt are \"released\" for building. Extensions may be made on the outer edge. The London green belt is larger than ever but it has moved far further out.The originator of the approach was a London architect who knew little about landscape or urban geography. He tried and failed to have it adopted in other countries, Scotland being an exception. Towns here have very dferent landscapes from each other so applying one spatial form to all never made sense. Yet that is what happened.Many professional planners have limited understanding of landscape or urban dynamics and know little of approaches used abroad. I prepared plans in several countries but never used a green belt and am pleased that the Highland and Falkirk councils have rejected the idea. The latter has instead adopted a \"greenspace plan\".In the s Glasgow-born Ian McHarg, then professor of landscape and regional planning at the prestigious University of Pennsylvania, wrote a book called Design with Nature. He and others devised an approach they called \"ecological planning\" and used this to formulate a strategy for the whole of New Jersey. I doubt many people here ever read the book or know anything of this approach to planning, yet it is what Central Scotland needs. Green belts belong to the age of steam engines and cannot deal with the complex issues of today.Objectors to this project are right that access to \"greenspace\" is crucial for health but seemingly think that this does not apply to those who need homes. Where these should live is seemingly not their concern.Future residents rarely participate in public consultations. The emphasis is always on the wishes of those who already live in the area and want to stop others also doing so. Just keeping people out of areas like this is not a fair and sensible approach to the problem.To say that the area would be dominated by roads is ludicrous. Such would use a tiny fraction of the area, maybe one per cent of that taken up by parks, reserves and gardensThe idea that only a few people should be allowed to live in areas of high amenity is obnoxious. Do objectors not have children or grandchildren whom they wish to have living nearby and enjoying the amenities they so value John Munro, Glasgow.WE NEED THE YOUNG TO TAKE ACTIONI WRITE in response to Otto Inglis , in which he states that our climate change policy is pointless while the Chinese, Indians and others massively increase their burning of fossil fuels.This is the meaningless, irrelevant argument that I and fellow campaigners in Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and every other conservation organisation have had to fight against for  years. So, according to Mr Inglis, just because India, China, et al are not, according to him, reducing their global footprint we have to continue raping the planet in order to keep big business harvesting loadsa dosh  There are no big businesses on a dead planet. Look at the latest pictures of Mars how many McDonalds do you see there  How many Amazons We have to listen to Greta’s generation, because for  years I have said to people “please don’t use plastic bags, please don’t destroy the insects that pollinate our food crops, please treat the sentient beings that give us our meat and milk more humanely, please don’t destroy the peat bogs and the forests that are protecting our existence. Pretty please”. Well now I have stopped saying please.We need the younger generation to rise up and glue themselves to roads, bridges and the like. Just as we had the Suffragettes moving on from the pacist methods of the Suffragists because the patriarchy refused to listen, we now have to use the methods of Extinction Rebellion, because people continue to refuse to listen.Margaret Forbes, Kilmacolm.BEWARE THE PENDING UPHEAVALWHILE we blither on about posh boys having a party, we are on the verge of a geopolitical upheaval that will alter the planet. My godson in Hong Kong confirms that China is back in charge and everything has changed. All those who protested have vanished.

Therefore the deadline for its commencement would be April, , .The new application, that went before OIC#s planning committee on Wednesday, sought to extend this deadline by an additional two years.On their website, Hoolan Energy said an extension would allow more time to connect to the national grid and provide more flexibilityany further delays occur.The new proposal also sought to increase the operational phase of the windfarm from  years to  years.Again, on their website, Hoolan Energy said that extending the operational lespan of the development would have meant increased energy production and carbon savings alongside increased socio-economic benefits.They added that turbine technology has become so advanced to the point that longer warranties and durations of consent are now commonplace.Once again, despite being recommended for approval by planning officers, the application was rejected by the committee.The clock is ticking when it comes to fulfilling a target set by energy regulator Ofgem, which asks for a total of MW-worth of projects to be in the pipeline before it gives the go-ahead for a new subsea interconnecter between Orkney and the Scottish Mainland.The deadline is December .Hoolan Energy’s two developments at Costa Head and Hesta Head account for around MW, while OIC hope to add a further .MW with its community windfarm project.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Both teams had the stoppage. Obviously you’ve got to stay focused and keep on the move.“I felt that when we came back out from the pause for the drone we started sloppy. But it’s stops and starts and we can’t do anything about that.“You’ve got to go out and continue with the game and they coped with it well and got the three points.”Toney’s goal, a fine volley from Bryan Mbeumo’s free-kick, took his tally for the season to seven.The -year-old feels Brentford need to use the international break to “reset” and get back to winning ways before they get sucked into trouble.“I feel there’s something we can take out of the game, we have to look forward now and try to change it in the next game,” he added.“On a personal note it was another one for the tally but it’s much sweeter when there’s three points behind it.“It’s time to reset. Obviously we’re on a bad run, we know that. But it’s not like we’ve been playing badly, we’re just conceding silly goals.“If we cut that out we’ve got a great chance. It’s time to restart and go again.”Wolves winger Adama Traore came on as a substitute amid reports linking him with Tottenham, and had a late goal ruled out for a tight offside.“The most important thing is the way he plays for us,” said boss Bruno Lage.“He played again with energy and scored the third ‘goal’ again. He scored last week, and the way he celebrated with his team-mates and also with me.“He’s a team player, a big professional and a lovely guy. I’m very happy with him.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?1642067512000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220113newstake part in this year s big garden birdwatch","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.

Even a knock or a bump could accelerate the transformation of tissue to bone.Lucy explained that when she and her sister were born their toes were shaped like bunions, one of the “tell tale signs” of FOP.However, at the time little was known about the condition, of which there is no definitive treatment or cure available, and the twins were not diagnosed until aged eight.Zoe explained: “When I was five I fell and broke my arm and it never really healed properly. When we were diagnosed with FOP no-one knew much about it because it was so rare.“At the time it was much harder for our parents as they really took the brunt of it because we were children.“But even now it can still be very hard because we are the only people with FOP in Northern Ireland.”Lucy added: “Back when we were children there was hardly any information about FOP but one person we were able to speak to was Fred Kaplan in Philadelphia.“He was the only person who knew much about it and even nowanything goes wrong we can send him an email.“He dedicates a lot of his time to research into FOP and we are very fortunate to have him.”The sisters, who attended Slemish College, described what it was like growing up in Ballymena with FOP.Zoe said: “We are so lucky to have each other but going to school was dficult in the sense that everyone was able bodied and we weren’t.“We went to Slemish which was such a great college, however, I was quite clumsy so I had to use a wheelchair and it was a bit harder for me because I couldn’t go outside at break times and join my friends.”When Lucy was  she tripped and hurt the back of her neck and the resulting bone growth left her unable to raise her arms above her head. In the same year Zoe broke her leg and was left unable to straighten it.Lucy explained that just recently she experienced a flare-up resulting in her jaw locking.She explained: “Over the last six months I have had a couple of flare-ups and it has been really dficult.“I had swelling under my chin and I couldn’t open my mouth so I had to have liquids.“I just kept telling myself that it won’t last and will get better which it did and I am thankful for that because there are people with FOP whose jaws have locked permanently.”Both Lucy and Zoe share a positive outlook on le which comes from practicing gratitude and not worrying about things outside of their control. Zoe who has a keen interest in interior design works for Ivy and Gold and lives in Cloughmills with her husband Mike whilst Lucy, a content creator, lives in Ballymena with her husband Michael.Zoe said: “I couldn’t get a job anywhere. I knew what I was able to do but no-one would take a chance on me. When I got a job with Ivy and Gold I was so grateful.” For Lucy and Zoe the pandemic has been particularly dficult as they are unable to get the vaccine due to their condition.Zoe said: We are normally together all the time but during lockdown we were from dferent households so we couldnt see each other.Butyou needed to be looked after and needed help you were allowed to go to someone s house so I went to my parents. It was hard for me to be on my own.Neither of us can get the vaccine because we cant have anything injected into our muscles so we have to be very careful.The sisters dont know what the future holds for them but they are determined to “live for the now”.Zoe said: “You cant think too far ahead because we dont know what the future holds for us with FOP.“We think it is best to live for the now becauseyou plan ahead too much you are easily disappointed.”Lucy and Zoe are keen to raise awareness of FOP through their social media channels and particularly want to highlight what signs to look out for.Lucy said: A baby with FOP will have toes that look like bunions and some children will have a joint missing in their thumb.“Spotting these first indicators allows parents to find out sooner rather than later whether or not their child has FOP.A petition to dedicate funding into research for the condition was debated in parliament at the end of last year. Lucy said: “Ian Paisley spoke on behalf of us and did such a good job. He fought our corner and we were very appreciative and hopefully it will go through to the next stage.“At the minute FOP families and friends fundraise but it is extremely hard as there are not that many of us.”Last year Zoes husband Mike and his work colleagues from Spar, Doury Road climbed Slemish and raised pound for FOP Friends.They are also planning to organise more fundraising events for the charity which is the only one in the UK dedicated to supporting people living with FOP and their families.The charity actively fundraises to support research into a treatment and a cure for FOP and more information can be found on their website www.fopfriendsYou can also find out more about Lucy and Zoe by following their Instagram handles which are Lucy Fretwell: allthingsbeautullymade and Zoe Buxton: alittlebitofle "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642778651871.jpg--covid_19___fri_21st_january_figures.jpg?1642778651000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220121newscovid 19 fri 21st january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

Credit: Niall CarsonLisa SmythTwitterJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailIt is one month since the Executive introduced a raft of restrictions aimed at reducing the spread of Omicron.Put in place just before Christmas and amid warnings that the health service could be overwhelmed by a surge in seriously ill patients, it now appears the iant is up to % less severe than Delta.Read MorePublic split over Executive plan to scrap coronavirus restrictionsGivan ready to abandon Covid passport schemeother Executive parties agreeIn fact, in a briefing paper presented to the Executive this week, ministers were told that while hospital admissions and Covid bed occupancy increased in the last week, they have peaked and started to fall slowly in the last few days.The document went on to explain the numbers of patients requiring supplementary oxygen, ICU occupancy and hospital deaths remained “relatively steady” and Covid- patients in critical care units were “still predominantly a result of Delta infection”.It is likely case numbers are going to rise in the coming weeks as a result of the virus running rampant through schools.This will eventually work its way into older age groups and is likely to result in more people requiring hospital treatment, but the official position is one of cautious optimism.And that’s why, as quickly as they were put in place, measures that business leaders and a public fed with up with two years of disruption to their lives, have been lted.Gone are the rule of six in pubs and restaurants and the requirement for table service in licensed premises has been lted, while the self-isolation period for positive cases has been dropped to five days.Meanwhile, from noon on Wednesday, further rules are to be relaxed, including dropping the use of Covid certicates at pubs, restaurants and cinemas, the reopening of nightclubs and the resumption of dancing and indoor standing events.And the First Minister has also indicated all remaining restrictions, such as legal requirements on face masks and regular lateral flow testing, could be scrapped next month.There does appear to be a growing sense that the worst may be over for Northern Ireland.Indeed, the World Health Organisation’s Covid chief has suggested the end of the pandemic is in sight for Britain.And Professor Devi Sridhar, Professor and Chair of Global Public Health at Edinburgh University, has also provided a chink of light.Writing in thethis week, she said: “Delaying and preventing infection as much as possible through this pandemic was a worthwhile strategy.“In early , there were few treatments, limited testing and no vaccines.“The cost of those lockdowns were big, but the effort to buy time paid off. In that time, sciences has transformed Covid from a deadly virus to a much less serious, nasty disease — one that is manageable at home, for the vast majority of those vaccinated.“It has, largely, defanged, it.”Of course, as with everything in science, this isn’t a position shared by everyone.Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist and statistical geneticist, has expressed alarm at the rolling back of restrictions. It comes amid an estimated , new cases of Covid- in Northern Ireland every day and a daily tally of more than , positive cases across the UK.“I certainly don’t think we are approaching the tail of the pandemic,” she said.“I have seen no evidence to indicate that and when you are recording more than , cases a day, to say the pandemic is over, it’s nonsense.“I can’t think of any country in the world that is lting restrictions when it’s recording more than , cases a day.”However, Northern Ireland’s chief scientic adviser, Professor Ian Young, has said he is “cautiously optimistic” about the future.“It is the World Health Organization that makes the call on whether it is a pandemic,” he explained.“We may move to a position where the virus becomes part of the background here, but it is still causing big problems in other countries.“I don’t think we’re near the end of the pandemic yet but I think in terms of the way the virus is behaving in this country, I think that we’re moving to a position where it will be endemic.“I think I am delighted as everyone  is that we’re in a position to be able to relax some of the restrictions, no-one wants to see those in place any longer than required.“I believe the Executive has made a very reasonable decision to take the brakes off but not throw everything out the window, and waiting to see how things go over the next three weeks before making the next round of decisions.”So,the statistics continue to move in the right direction and Northern Ireland comes out from under the shadow of Omicron without suffering the catastrophe threatened before Christmas, will le as we knew it before Covid- resume A major question for the Executive will be whether they keep in place the current testing and contact tracing infrastructure once the threat of Omicron has passed.Another consideration — how long will the Department of Health continue to update its daily Covid- dashboard with statistics on daily cases, hospitalisations and deaths Most experts now agree the figures cannot be relied upon given the current testing regime, so how much do we actually learn from the daily update Also, will Northern Ireland remain in crisis mode evenit regards Covid- as endemic while other countries around the world continue to struggle At what stage will our hospitals be able to resume elective surgery to any degree that it stops the spiralling waiting lists And what threat is posed by another iant It is true that the vaccines are playing a major role in keeping people safe — but we cannot exclude the possibility of a vaccine resistant iant that results in serious illness.Professor Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “It could happen next month or it could happen in  years. “As we have seen throughout the pandemic, it’s impossible to predict what is going to happen.”Prof Young has also said he cannot rule out the possibility, although he stressed “it would be unlucky”.Assuming that we are now finally moving beyond the almost permanent crisis state in which we have existed for almost two years, what next It is naïve — and dare I say it somewhat selfish— to think we are going toto a world without some form of public health measures once the worst of Omicron has passed.While for the majority of people, Covid- will be a self-limiting illness that can be treated at home, there will be those who are still clinically extremely vulnerable. Even with the vaccines and advances in treatments, the virus will still claim lives.What measures will the public accept to ensure the tens of thousands of people regarded as extremely vulnerable to the virus don’t have to remain locked away indefinitely In herarticle, Prof Sridhar stressed evenCovid- is endemic, “that doesn’t mean harmless”.She continued: “Endemic means that we accept a circulation of a disease because elimination or eradication is perceived as too dficult.“Malaria, dengue and measles are endemic in certain parts of the world even though they are all serious diseases.“Malaria was endemic in the United States until the government decided to eliminate it.“This is part of a larger question about how much we continue to alter what ‘normal’ social relations are, given the circulation of Sars-CoV-.“Humans are social, we need to hug, dance, sing and recognise each other’s faces and smiles. A sense of community and connection are vital to wellbeing too.“Public health is not about one disease, it is broadly about well-being, which includes mental health and being able to pay the rent, feed your family, stay warm through winter and have a meaningful role in society.”To do this, we need to develop better ways of living alongside Covid-.For Dr Ultan Power, professor of molecular virology at Queen’s University in Belfast, this includes more research to establish levels of immunity and theof time people remain infectious.This would, he said, allow policy makers to make better and more informed decisions over the likes of self-isolation.“If we could develop a rapid test that predicts how long someone is infectious, not whether they are still positive, that would be very helpful,” he explained.Meanwhile, experts such as Dr Gurdasani and Dr Gabriel Scally, visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol, are clear that measures such as air filtration systems in schools will protect children across Northern Ireland from all airborne disease.The Education Minister has so far resisted calls for their implementation, citing insufficient evidence to warrant the £m bill.However, the hope is that our politicians and officials will take steps now to keep us safe in the future.If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that a novel virus, capable of killing millions of people around the world is not just a Hollywood concept but can become a reality within a matter of months.Related topicsThe Executive OfficeDelta iantDepartment of HealthDepartment of EducationMore On The Executive Office PremiumViewpointOpinionOpinion poll a mixed bag for the DUPGivan ready to abandon Covid passport schemeother Executive parties agree PremiumConsiderable unionist support for DUP stance on scrapping ProtocolDisaster for DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson as Sinn Fein extends lead to eight points PremiumViewpointOpinionFreedom comes at a price for everyoneMost ReadLuxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughDisaster for DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson as Sinn Fein extends lead to eight pointsClokey House in The Spa one of Co Down’s most impressive contemporary luxury homesDead man ‘propped up by two other men in attempt to collect pension at Carlow post office’Two men die following crash on Belfast’s Ravenhill RoadTop VideosPlayVideo: Northern Ireland leaders break ground for new Derry hotelPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy Latest CoronavirusGame Changer Awards to honour and celebrate Northern Ireland’s inspirational sportswomenGivan ready to abandon Covid passport schemeother Executive parties agreeFirst Minister Paul Givan urges NI Covid passport to be ‘withdrawn in all settings’Public split over Executive plan to scrap coronavirus restrictionsMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLatestStormy Daniels and former ally Michael Avenatti to face each other in courtThomas Pieters hopes Abu Dhabi win inspires emerging BelgiansQueen to spend few weeks at Sandringham after flying in from Windsor CastleRaab urges NHS staff to get mandatory jabs amid calls for deadline delayHitchcock and the #MeToo reckoning that never was,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they

Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

Rabbits instinctively freeze when caught in a beam of light making them sitting targets for anyone with a shotgun.However, the sudden spread of the problem has alarmed the RUC which is appealing for people not to take part in what is regarded as a ldquohighly dangerous occupation.COMBER ndash Plans for the second stage of the Comber by-pass have been postponed for four years, it has been revealed.Strangford Ulster Unionist MP, Mr John Taylor, said he has been informed of the decision which he says has left him ldquoshell-shocked.ldquoTogether with local councillors and Comber businessmen I have been campaigning for many years to get the by-pass built. It is incredible that the Conservative Party is so mishandling the local economy that a scheme of such major importance to Comber and the outlying areas can be postponed to a date four years from now, Mr Taylor said this week.ldquoThe Minister met myself and a delegation of Ards Borough councillors last year and he agreed that Comber by-pass was a priority scheme Now he has shelved it for four years.ldquoI can understand slippage of a few months due to existing schemes costing more than has already been planned but a four year delay is out of the question.Mr Taylor said he has spoken to local members of his partyrsquos Comber branch and they are ldquohorried at the decision.BISHOPSCOURT ndash A total of around  local residents have signed a petition opposing proposals to turn the former Bishopscourt airfield into a motor-race track.The petition organisers say they are delighted by the response which indicates a ldquothumbs-down by the majority of people living in the area.ldquoThe residents all live in the immediate vicinity of the airfield or along the Downpatrick to Ballyhornan road, and so are the people most likely to be affectedthe planned track were to go ahead, explained a spokesman this week.The residents say they are concerned at proposals, currently with the Planning Service in Downpatrick, to turn part of the former air base at Ballyhornan into a race track.A spokesman said the petition is to be sent to the planning authorities and to the Minister for the Environment, Mr Richard Needham, this week. They are also to seek a meeting with planners to outline their case.SAINTFIELD ndash Damage to Saintfieldrsquos century-old floral farm cart at the weekend has infuriated village residents and especially the members of the pioneering Bloom committee.The celebrated cart, laden with polyanthus, pansies and spring flowers, had its shafts broken at the body when it was lted from its perch and ped to the ground before midnight on Saturday.In December it was removed to the side of the Orange Hall and behind locked gates to make space for the Christmas tree. It was due to be relocated on its traditional spot.Although noises were heard on Saturday night, the damage was not discovered until Monday morning when Mr Bob McCaughtry was preparing to open the Orange Hall for the weekly visit by Department of Health and Social Services personnel..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Hockey.jpg","title":"Local derby is all square  ","story":"A LARGE crowd gathered at the Demesne to watch the local derby which included Ballynahinchrsquos travelling faithful alongside the Saintfield home support.The first quarter began with both teams sitting back and waiting to see what their opponent was going to do.lsquoHinch started to play the ball from defence to midfield with Andrew Mulholland passing the ball to Scott Leetch, who was able to sht it out wide to apply pressure on Saintfield.Josh Higginson was able to create space down the left wing before passing to Matthew Martin at the top of the circle, only to be stopped in his tracks.Saintfield started to apply the pressure on lsquoHinch but they were halted in their attack down the right wing by defenders Hugo Melville and Leslie Harrison.They both displayed some outstanding tackling, which contributed to the opening minutes remaining goalless.The local rivals started to settle into the game after some quick instructions and soon passes began to link up nicely.As the game started to heat up, both teams were fighting for every ball and neither were sitting back. The competitiveness of the derby resulted in a stalemate by half-time.With chances coming early on into the third quarter, short corners naturally started to follow. lsquoHinch were able to work the ball up through Adam Dodds before passing over to Jason Campbell, who was able to win a short corner for his side.Matthew Martin released his drag flick going just wide of the post.Saintfield were able to keep lsquoHinch at bay until a cross ball from Martin found team-mate Andrew McIlwaine at the back post to opening the scoring.With lsquoHinch looking to keep their lead, they engaged a high press on to the Saintfield defence as they hoped to increase their lead.However, with this high press tactic Saintfield were able to break away past the lsquoHinch defence only to be met at the top of the circle by lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell, who did well to prevent a goal.A super ball from Leslie Harrison to forward Lewis Higginson, allowed the lsquoHinch attacker to run the baseline and win a short corner.Martin took a drag flick only to be stopped by the Saintfield lsquokeeper.Saintfield responded by pushing lsquoHinch into their own circle and winning a short corner.The Saints managed to convert off the short corner to equalise the game in the final quarter.Despite a few more half chances, both sides went home with a share of the spoils..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Magnificent Kilcoo are champs of Ulster again  ","story":"KILCOO are one game away from a place in this yearrsquos All-Ireland Club Championship final.Last Sunday, the Magpies produced a spectacular performance to dismantle Fermanagh champions Derrygonnelly at the Athletic Grounds in a one-sided affair to win by  points.Mickey Moranrsquos men are now red-hot favourites to win the All-Ireland club final after losing out to Galway champions Corofin after extra-time in .But Kilcoo must first overcome St Finbarrrsquos in the semi-final clash at pm on Saturday, January  at OrsquoMoore Park, Portlaoise and will be taking nothing for granted.Last Sunday, goals from Daryl Branagan, Ceilum Doherty and Shealan Johnston contributed to the onslaught in Armagh to secure the Ulster title by a comfortable margin.Paul Devlin enjoyed his afternoon splitting the sticks, with reassurance within the squad stemming all theway from the back through Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane, who bossed hisarea and even registered a point of his own.With the pain of the  All-Ireland defeat still hurting, Kilcoo will be looking to right that wrong and taste success.ldquoThe Corofin game really hurt, said Kilcoo star Ryan McEvoy.ldquoAfter playing so well for so long and then just not getting over the line, it hurt.

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying. It will be a great achievementwe are successful.ldquoThis is probably the only source of funding that can preserve the windmill and the other two buildings of the scheduled monument for future generations. Without this funding, the buildings will continue their slow decline and will eventually collapse.Meanwhile, the man who is supporting the community park proposal visited Saintfield recently.Mr Moffett has already made a substantial donation to the association to enable it to purchase the Windmill Field.During his visit, Mr Moffett had an opportunity to walk around the field and visualise how the proposed community park would surround the ancient windmill and caretakerrsquos home that is part of Saintfieldrsquos history. He also met a number of residents at the community centre before visiting Rowallane Garden for a guided tour.Mr Moffett concluded the first day of his visit with a visit to the Belfast Road community centre to view the new facility and was impressed at the potential of fitting out the remaining empty buildings which would include a heritage area to complement the planned windmill park.Mr Moffett, who also played a round of golf at Royal County Down and visited the Mournes, said the beauty of Co Down, with its unique visitor sites and the central location of Saintfield, reinforced in his mind the importance of the windmill park project and the heritage centre.The third and final day of his visit was spent at a local shop exploring the location of his familyrsquos th century farm in Leggygowan.Mr Moffett said: ldquoExploring my family history was a wonderful way to end my visit to Saintfield.

It was revealed last May that one driver was clocked travelling at an incredible mph in the mph zone in Saintfield at am.Figures released by the PCSP over the past year have revealed that speeding in built-up areas across the district continues to be a major problem.In addition to the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield, other speeding hot spots include the Strangford Road in Downpatrick and South Promenade in Newcastle.The Dundrum Road in Clough is a new entry on the list following the installation of an electronic speeding device on the approach to the village, while the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass is another new entry on the speeding hot-spot list.The highest speed recorded in the mph zone in Clough was mph at am, with the highest speed at the Strangford Road mdash where a mph limit is in place mdash was mph. This offence was detected around am.Since the speeds recorded by the electronic devices have been made public, politicians have expressed their shock at the behaviour of those who continue to break the law and have appealed to them to slow down.Erected as part of a major offensive on speeding drivers at a number of well known speeding hot spots, the speed indicator devices are being hailed a success as speeds in most areas where they are located are reducing.However, concern remains about the behaviour of some drivers continuing to show a blatant disregard for mph and mph speed limits in place.Recent figures published by the PCSP revealed that the highest number of speeders in Castlewellan and Killyleagh were detected around am and pm respectively, with those who hit high speeds in Ardglass detected at pm.While Clough recorded the highest speed, a detailed examination of the figures reveals that five drivers went through the mph in the village at mph, with % of all drivers travelling in excess of the speed limit.In Downpatrick,  drivers were detected at over mph in the mph zone, with one driver clocked at mph in the mph zone at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan. The highest speed recorded at the mph zone at the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass was mph.Policing and Community Safety Partnership officials say that figures recorded across the districtrsquos speed indicator signs for the most recent three-month period shows an overall speed reduction of around six percent.The number of drivers clocked at over mph across the  speed indicator signs spread across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area was almost , while the average number of speeding violations over mph was %.

It has been highly infectious but has had minor health impacts.This is a time to celebrate the success of the vaccine programme, above all in the United Kingdom — a country of which we are lucky to be a part given that is a global scientic leader and played a key role in developing the medications.It is also a time to recognise the way in which the great bulk of people have, cheerfully enough, adapted to the new considerate ways of living in a pandemic.This experience will almost certainly help us to respond much more quickly to any future viral outbreak. Many people, for example, will want to continue to wear masks even when they cease to be mandatory.It might yet be that there is fresh, more dangerous outbreak of Covid. But we can no longer put le on hold due to that possibility.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.My understanding is that there was no wider agreement between the Tories and Sir Jeffrey, who put a brave face this week on the u-turn.It puts him in a tricky situation after he becomes a Stormont MLA.First there will be a Westminster by-election in Lagan Valley, where the DUP majority in  was slashed from, in , a colossal , votes over the next nearest rivalto a still clear but uncomfortably reduced majority of , over Alliance.But it also greatly undermines a key point of leverage for Sir Jeffrey.Owen Polley on page   writes about how the DUP pledge to end this term of Stormont and force an election in the absence of reform to the NI Protocol has now been rendered almost meaningless by delays in London’s deadline for an EU deal.The DUP did however have another card: it could have taken advantage of emerging legislation to make Stormont more stable, which would allow an increased six month period after May’s elections before an executive must be formed. The party could have stalled on agreeing to such a formationit didn’t have a result on the Irish Sea border.ButSir Jeffrey will be without a Westminster seat then he will be known to be in the same situation Arlene Foster found herself after  – effectively jobless unless Stormont is operating as normal.Thus the u-turn by Boris Johnson this week leaves the DUP with badly reduced options. The party also looks isolated amid the joint six-party approach to Mr Johnson against the double jobbing plan.This must all be a joy for Sinn Fein. On one issue or another they have found themselves joined by almost all of the parties as signatories in petitions to power against ious topics of the day.They enjoyed multi-party photo opportunities for their demand for an Irish language act, yet I never recall a single multi-party approach to London or Dublin calling on the two governments to ensure that SF’s collapse of Stormont in  did not get political reward .Sinn Fein enjoyed four-party approaches to the EU both before the NI Protocol was agreed, and after .On double jobbing it finds itself alongside the Ulster Unionist Party in its joint approach to Downing St. And there was a notable moment last year when Paul Givan observed that SF was, like the other parties, opposed to the government legacy plan, and he said the party could influence such debates by taking its Westminster seats. This gave a sense of common purpose, which was unfortunate given that the republican role in the Troubles is at the core of unionist dislike of SF. You might expect that on legacy, above all issues, unionists would express contempt for the republican stance on an amnesty, and emphasise that their rejection of the proposed stay on prosecutions is for reasons opposite to those of SF.But whatever mis-steps unionists make, it is only fair to note that they get little consistent, heavyweight support at Westminster.Every so often this paper is alerted to a sympathetic question that a pro unionist peer has asked in the Lords, soliciting a seemingly unionist answer from a minister. But this is no match for Tory MPs such as Julian Smith and Simon Hoare, the influential NI Affairs Committee chair, who speak up as soon as Ireland is upset about something. Hoare, an MP who is swt to dismiss unionist concerns , this week led the Commons chorus against the double jobbing move. The government soon buckled to his arguments.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor• Ben Lowry: My memory of  Meat Loaf concert in Belfast• Ben Lowry January : Double jobbing change seems to be bid by London to shore up the DUP• Owen Polley: Flip-flopping prime minister can’t be relied on to sort out the Northern Ireland Protocol"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland is lucky to have kenneth branagh as an ambassador ","story":"Work starts on £m hotel plan at former military base   Murder of Sir Norman Stronge recalled on anniversary of ‘barbarous’ IRA attackNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionNorthern Ireland is lucky to have Kenneth Branagh as an ambassadorNews Letter editorial of Saturday January  :By EditorialSaturday, nd January , : amUpdated Saturday, nd January , : am  \"       \"  News Letter editorialFrom Stephen Boyd to Liam Neeson, some Northern Ireland have found fame in Hollywood.Ken Branagh is one of the most successful of them all.

I could have the weight of the world on my shoulders before my show - I’m not always chirpy, chirpy, chirpy all the time, but as soon as I am on air I forget about all my worries and am just in that moment of communication with my listeners.Hugo on his wedding day with Joan in . The couple have one daughter and four grandchildren“The same with anytime I go out on stage and pick up a microphone to sing. Those moments are magical to me.”The wee man from Strabane certainly has musical kudos.In the early s, he was spotted on a TV talent show on RTE and signed by the then fledgling Release Records, which later spawned such stars as Philomena Begley, Ray Lynam and Eurovision star Jonny Logan.By the time he was , he had formed his own band, Hugo Duncan and the Tall Men, and had a number one hit in the Irish charts with Dear God.Hugo and his only daughter Suzanne. The broadcaster says his family is his proudest achievement alongside singing, performing and broadcasting. Duncan says he is never happier than when he is on air and forgets all his personal troubles as soon as he begins his weekly show on BBC Radio UlsterThe ever popular broadcaster explains how his music career took off when the showband era was at its height. At first he could only play three or so chords on the guitar with a capo, but he didn’t let that deter him, and while muso bosses at first demurred at making him a frontman because of his diminutive stature, they eventually relented.“I used to sing on my own in bars in Strabane and all over, then I was gigging with a wee band all over the country for £ or £. a night. That was certainly a long time ago. “I remember I turned  on a Thursday, March ,  I was married the following Thursday and the following Thursday fortnight my mother Susie who raised me on her own died.Hugo having a lark at an outside broadcast pre-pandemic. During lockdown he most missed driving as he likes to travel all over the country from his native Strabane to Kerry, Waterford, Wexford and other parts of the Republic“A close friend of mine, Theo, was a presenter on Highland Radio, who was in a band called The Polka Dots who were managed by Barney Curley. I would say my voice is good, but I’m definitely no Mario Lanza. “The management team tried to oust me because I was small, five foot five . They wanted a traditional six foot frontman, but then they went with Hugo Duncan and The Tall Men, because my friend Pio McCann said to them, “Well, are you looking for a singer or a male model ’ And so I was signed up.He added: “When we had our hit with Dear God in the Irish charts we were walking on air. We lived for today and tomorrow would look after itself. We were at one point one of the top three bands in Ireland. “But then I got into the drink in a big way, from the early s until the  December , and I have not had an alcoholic drink since then, thank God. I just stick to Coca-Cola or orange juice, but I still love being in bars.”He met his we Joan, the love of his le, while they were both working at a nylon factory in Strabane and he credits her almost entirely with keeping him grounded.Hugo recalls: “I was backward about coming forwards on the matter. She used to work in the Gorey Cinema in Newtownstewart selling ice cream, but even when we were courtin’ she wouldn’t have given me a free one.“We were courtin’ from , for  months, then I was working a night sht and I was standing in the hallway of her own house to give her a good night kiss. “There was a song on the radio playing ‘I will never be married, I’ll be no man’s we’ and I just said ‘Will you marry me ’ And that was it. It all happened up against the coats.”A huge hit on the air waves, and particularly with an older demographic of listeners, although plenty of young country music fans tune in frequently too, he is sustained by his Christian faith.“I believe in God and I would pray every day, but I wouldn’t force my religion on anybody. “People say we are two communities here, but we both, Protestant and Catholic, have far more in common than what ides us. “We all bleed when we are cut, we all cry when we are hurt. “I love that my programme goes to every part of Northern Ireland and I think this mutual love of country music can bring us all together - everyone loves the best of country music old and new across Ulster.”‘I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY AS MUCH AS I CAN’“My new year’s resolutions are to broadcast as much as I can, sing as much as I can and make people happy as much as I can,” says Hugo, who does come across as one of the most cheery people you could meet and that palpable sense of bonhomie and banter and good craic is so apparent on the air waves that it’s no wonder his show is such a hit.He started out in radio after being offered a slot at a station based in Donegal.Hugo recalls: “I began on Donegal Radio and then moved to Radio Foyle, doing  minutes here a and there and then I got a show with Radio Ulster, initially on a Saturday night, and I began to say during a wee teaser ‘Now we’ll play a song for the children before they go to bed, so phone in and tell your Uncle Hugo what you would like to hear played.’ “And then that moniker just stuck with me.”Uncle Hugo, as he prefers to be known, joined Radio Foyle during the s doing holiday relief, after which he was offered a job presenting his own weekly show. In October , he began presenting on BBC Radio Ulster.UNCLE HUGO UP THERE WITH THE NEWS LETTER’S BILLY KENNEDY AS COUNTRY MUSIC CONNOISSEURThough a much-loved radio star, an adept performer and someone with a forensic knowledge of country music to rival the News Letter’s very own in-house expert Billy Kennedy, Hugo insists that his proudest achievement in le is without question his family.“My we Joan, my daughter Suzanne and my grandchildren are the lights of my le - absolutely. “But after that I love being able to sing and entertain and more than anything, from the soles of my feet to the very top of my scalp, to try to bring people joy. I just love trying to make people happy and seeing a smile on their faces. “Also, I once sang in the Royal Albert Hall, at Villanova University and in New York.“I love singing in and around Strabane, in Lford and where in Donegal because there’s a whole network of people I know very well there.“I have always lived in Strabane, I love Strabane and I intend to die in Strabane.”I ask him why he thinks the popularity of country music is so predominant across the province.“I think it’s because so many of a certain generation grew up in the showband era and a lot of them were popularising country music. “From the s on the showbands and country music were very much loved here.“The next generation of Irish country singers coming along like Derek Ryan and Nathan Carter and Lisa McHugh, things are much more dferent for them in that they’re so much more business and PR savvy but a lot of the time they are doing covers of older songs like stuff from Foster and Allen and all the older great country music stars - there are so many of them close to my heart that it’s virtually impossible to list them all.“Butyou’re chatting about Irish country music, then a hugely important artist, in my view, is Daniel O’Donnell. “He would get up and sing for ten people with as much dedication and enthusiasm as he would sing for , people, and whatever the size of the audience he holds them captive, just in the palm of his hand.“He’s honestly a lovely human being and in my view a top musical performer - one of my absolute favourites, in fact, and someone I deeply respect.”As a celebrity broadcaster Hugo could well get a big head, but he insists this is not the case.“But I do love when I go to supermarkets and people will meet me and ask for photographs and a chat and my we gets angry because I would really stop and chat with everybody, and she’d rather I just pushed the trolley as fast as I can,” he laughs.QA: ‘GOD BLESS LITTLE CHILDREN, WHILE THEY’RE TOO YOUNG TO HATE’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories I grew up with just my mother Susie and I in a terrace house. There was always music and a welcome in our house and my wee mother used to say she was always singing that she was “always a bridesmaid and never a bride”.We were very close to our neighbours. In those days nobody locked their doors and I was always really well looked after. I would have went in there, say next door, and they would say ‘Come on in here, Hugh’ - never Hugo, ‘To get a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter and that will do you until you get your dinner.’ And then my godmother was always making buns for me, and I was in and out of all the houses nearby on my street.Tell us about your school days I was never academic and I was always more drawn to music, especially once my mother bought me a band kit with Providence cheques, I was always singing and gigging about the place. I think I have a short attention span.I didn’t mind arithmetic, but once they got into all those equations and all, then I switched off. I hated PE and sports.What is the secret of your the longevity of your marriage Joan is the backbone of everything, and our daughter Suzanne arrived just a year after our marriage in . We now have four grandchildren, Jake, Ellie-Mae, Molly-Jay,and Katie-Sue. Things were tough when Suzanne had cancer but we got through it all and I really think my Joan is the one who holds all the family together - she has a very strong Christian faith.Tell us your favourite country music artists Tom T Hall, a real singer songwriter and story-teller, and I actually went to his home on two dferent occasions to interview him with a film crew. He wrote a song called Old Dogs and Children and Watermelon Wine and the line of the song that really hit me and spoke to me from the moment I heard it was ‘God bless little children, while they’re still too young to hate’. I also love George Jones, Merle Haggard, Buck Owen - all the old country singers.But I love all kinds of music and singing all kinds of songs. I appreciate traditional, jazz and lots of other genres, but country always comes first. What is your favourite way to spend a day I love driving, and being in transit. I used to do -k miles a year driving up and down Ireland, all over. From home to Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, almost every county. And I just love getting out and singing and performing with a band because the buzz you get from doing what you do on stage is second to none.Listen to Hugo Duncan on BBC Radio Ulster, Wednesdays, from .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"key date ahead as all restrictions to be reviewed ","story":"Work starts on £m hotel plan at former military base   DUP saysgovernment will axe double-jobbing due to lack of support in NI then why won’t it axe the Irish Sea border NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeople‘Key date’ ahead as ‘all restrictions’ to be reviewedThe next Stormont Executive meeting could be a “key date” as Northern Ireland hopes to move out of the coronavirus pandemic, Health Minister Robin Swann has said.By Niall DeeneySaturday, nd January , : amUpdated Saturday, nd January , : am  \"       \"  He was looking ahead to the next meeting on February , after the Executive agreed to remove several of the restrictions still in place when it met on Thursday.Following that meeting, a spokesperson for the Executive Office at Stormont confirmed that “all remaining covid measures will be reviewed” on February .While Mr Swann has sounded a note of cautious optimism, it is far from certain the remaining restrictions will be dispensed with when the Executive meets again in under three weeks.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

A number of restrictions were changed including the ending of table service only in pubs and restaurants. Jade Dawson and Lydia Hope, who are on holiday from England, enjoy a drink in the DuKe of York in Belfast City Centre. Picture by Jonathan Porter PressEyeThe News Letter has spoken to several members of the Stormont health committee, from a range of parties, who expressed caution when it comes to the lting of remaining rules.The Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw said it would be “unrealistic” to assume all remaining rules will be dropped so soon.Mr Swann’s UUP colleague, Alan Chambers, said he is “reluctant to read too much into” the announcement that all remaining restrictions would soon be reviewed.The DUP’s Deborah Erskine, however, urged ministers to remember that coronavirus restrictions are only to be kept in place as long as they are deemed “absolutely necessary”.Minister for Health Robin SwannMr Swann, meanwhile, spoke to the media in Antrim after a swathe of restrictions were relaxed, including an end to the legal requirement for Covid certication to enter some hospitality venues, and the reopening of nightclubs. “I have always taken the decision at the time in regards to the advice that was put forward via my chief medical officer and chief scientic adviser, so February , while it will be a key date, let’s make sure we get there safely and as collectively as we can,” he said.“I would still encourage people to follow the guidance, follow the regulations that are still in place and take the opportunities to come forward and get their vaccines and their boosters.“There are three weeks to go and I want to keep the trajectory of this virus going in the same direction as it has been, and that’s downwards.”Ms Bradshaw, speaking to the News Letter, said: “Everything, at every stage, of every Executive meeting has been reviewed and looked at so I think it’s unrealistic to assume that there will certainly be this huge lting of remaining restrictions as there has been in England.“I don’t think we will see them go away as quickly as the announcement of that date would suggest. “We are still getting , cases per day. I think that, obviously, there is less death but there are still people dying every day and there are still a lot of people on ventillators fighting for their lives. “We are certainly not out of the woods yet.”Mr Chambers said: “It’s not unusual that the Executive are going to review all restrictions in early February. “I’m reluctant to read too much into it, because at every Executive meeting everything is under review. “There isn’t anything unusual about that, and I wouldn’t read too much into ‘nudge, nudge, wink, wink’ suggestions that have been coming from some members of the Executive.“Yes, everything will be considered, but it will absolutely depend on the scientic and medical advice. Now, we all want to see normality and we want to get back to the things we had taken for granted.“Everything is always on the table. There’s a Covid taskforce that reports and it reports at every Executive meeting, as would the chief medical officer and thechief scientic advisor.”He added: “We [the UUP] follow and support the medical and scientic advice. We do not lobby for a particular thing to happen.”Ms Erskine said: “Decisions taken by the Executive need to be evidence based, targeted and effective. “There has always been a duty on ministers to ensure that restrictions are in place for no longer than is absolutely necessary. “When decisions are next taken on February  that must be the guiding principle again.“As we hopefully see the medical threat from Covid- continue to reduce, there must also be a renewed focus on the economic impact of restrictions and how we can best support businesses refocus and rebuild.”Robin SwannStormont ExecutiveNorthern Ireland  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularYoung unionists react to BBC’s Stephen Nolan: Why our peers don’t want to speak out in the mediaWatch the reaction of some of the first people to see Belfast film on official UK release dateDUP under fire for supporting flag-flying on Prince Andrew’s birthday for the time being – whilst veteran UUP man backs this stancePSNI: Two men killed in road traffic collisionBen Lowry: The double jobbing u-turn leaves the DUP with reduced options at StormontMost PopularBest bread makers - tried and tested, from Panasonic, Morphy Richards, and LakelandBest boxed mattress deals for January: discounts on Emma, Simba, Nectar, Eve, Dreamcloud and OTTYBest electric heaters UK: portable electric, ceramic, and fan heaters from Dimplex, De’Longhi, SilentnightSofas UK: best sofas and couches to furnish your home, whatever your budget, and how to pick the best for youBest men’s dressing gowns: ten of the most luxurious bathrobes for men to keep you cosy and dry                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Photo: NY photography   David Paul LarsonBelfast artist Brian John Spencer believes the key reason young unionists are not willing to speak up in the media is because they have lost all connections with their past.“So, middle class unionists become ashamed of their history because of the way media - even the big Hollywood blockbusters - has made them feel ashamed of the RUC,” he said.But he believes there is much to be proud of.“The Ulster Covenant was signed by half a million people - compared to the Irish proclamation, which was only signed by seven.”Darrin Foster says leadership in unionism could do much more but that the media is also to blame.A huge proportion of unionists will have relatives who signed the Covenant, he notes.“That was my way of finding identity and root in Ireland as opposed to someone who was made to feel foriegn and alien.”He was prompted to explore his roots by comment such as that he encountered while on an Erasmus exchange where he met a fellow student from Co Mayo who was a keen fan of Irish nationalist movies.“He was watching ‘The wind that shakes the barley [film] and told me - ‘Give us back our land!’ There were flippant comments passed off as a joke but there is an underlying sentiment there. “That prompted me to reverse my deculturalisation and that made me cling to the Ulster Covenant. I went on my journey and found I have at least two great grandparents who signed it, possibly three.“It made me realise thatyou go into a bar in Dublin, every other bar has the Irish Proclamation and a lot of young people have it on their walls, or icons of Michael Collins.“Nolan simply verbaliseda sentiment that I would sense. I have heard it said by a soft unionist playwright that when he did a play on the UDR it was almost impossible to get young actors to take the roles.“Young unionists tend to be a lot more consumerist and disconnected from their history. The past is not as big a deal for them. They don’t have the grievance that is passed down the way nationalists would.“Nationalists would talk about how they couldn’t get jobs for example though unionists do have cause for grievance too. I know a businessman in Belfast whose grandfather was intimidated out of Monaghan, but for some reason it is not as acceptable to say that.“I don’t knowmy art has suffered butI was a young artist painting Michael Collins or the Irish Proclamation or railing against Brexit I think I would have a much bigger  - but I can’t deny my history.“So I enjoy painting Edward Carson and unionist figures, but that doesn’t really get any traction. I think it is as much to do with a bigger overarching culture of what mainstream institutions want to promote.“I know the overarching culture in the media, Hollywood and arts [about Irish nationalism], I know how that makes me feel a bit abandonedor alienatedand not spoken for.“It is a primal feeling that hits you in the chest. There are some things that are said and other things that aren’t - the full picture is not being spoken so I feel compelled as someone who has a bit of a  with his art and writing to speak out about it.“I was so alarmed by Michael D Higgins’ focus on the Black and Tans activity in Balbriggan and burning of Cork in his speech last year. I thought - by all means draw attention to that - but why are you not also talking about the IRA burning down Shane’s Castle and Belfast Customs House and Liverpool Docks  And why not remember how the IRA intercepted letters from the Black and Tans and found out their home addresses in Cheshire and burnt out their families from their farms  Why are those stories not being told too “The feeling I got of being told ‘you are not legitimate, you are alien’ was in  . That made me start my blog that gave me the armoryto put down these roots that had evaporated.“The big Hollywood blockbuster movies - The wind that shakes the barley and Michael Collins - portrays all the British as the villains and the nationalists as the good guys but in fact the history is incredibly nuanced and complex.”Twenty-six-year old Darrin Foster, a TUV assembly candidate from Upper Bann, felt the issue could be lack of opportunities.“I know we have problems getting anybody  but [party leader] Jim Allister speaking in the media. They don’t want anybody . They phone us looking for someone to speak andwe say ‘Jim is not available but I have got this guy’, they will say, ‘No, sorry it’s all right’. So there is actually a perception that they don’t want anybody .”Darrin posts his political views on Facebook but not on Twitter because “all you get is abuse”.He adds: “If you look at my campaign video on Twitter there is just abuse about what you are wearing, where you are from, what you look like....”.He notices other young unionists posting their views get similar volumes of abuse, usually from anonymous accounts. Personally he would be very comfortable to speak about politics in the media.“Obviously someone of my age may have a lot less experience than someone older. But you are only going to get experience through doing it.”He does agree with Stephen Nolan that there are not many opportunities for personal development for aspiring unionist politicians, the TUV being the exception.“Nationalists and unionists are given equal time to speak in the media but unionists are questioned dferently,” he adds.“If a unionist is speaking on Brexit and the union you will be challenged much more on that than someone expressing an opinion in favour of a United Ireland. You will be challenged to explain ‘What are the benefits of the union  Why do you think there shouldn’t be a border in the Irish Sea ’ “Butsomebody says there shouldn’t be a land border it is just let go.”He also feels unionist perspectives on legacy are not welcomed in the media.“The narrative on soldiers is always about what they shouldn’t have been doing, though it was very rare indeed that a soldier was doing something wrong in the scale of things. But itis never noted that they wouldn’t have neededto be here in the first placethe IRA weren’t blowing up the country.”Some unionists feared for their careersthey spoke openly about what they believed.‘William’, a rural unionist in his early twenties, thought Stephen Nolan was “absolutely bang on” about the lack of training for young unionists.“Some people say there are young articulate unionists but that they are scared to put their head above the parapets, but there has been a generational problem where we haven’ttrained young unionists to think in a political way the way the other side have. I think that is a real problem,” he said.“I think they are afraid but I also think they are ill equipped. I thinkthere is a culture of shame. Our society by and large has made unionists - particularly young unionists - feel that being a unionist is something to be embarrassed about.“In the way the media speaks about unionists, for example, somebody like myself who is anti-Belfast Agreement, will be labeled an extremist. It kind of makes it taboo. “There is a problem with unionists being ill equipped - there is no doubt in my mind.”The advantage with nationalists, he feels, may not so much be formal training as culture.“Nationalists have a realisation from a young age that they need to articulate their aspirations in a way that we don’t. Unionism hasn’tadjusted to a modern Northern Ireland wherewe have to make our case. Young unionists are only given tickbox opportunities where nationalists get genuine opportunities.”He argues that the age profile of nationalist MLAs is increasingly much younger than unionists MLAs, for example.Asked what part of his culture he is made to feel ashamed of, he replies: “All of it. In terms of legacy, in culture. A shame has permeated our society around the unionist narrative of the past, particularly around the security forces.”He believes society has “smeared” the reputations of the RUC and UDR unfairly and young unionists feel they can’t be associated with them. “Culturally, particularlythe Orange tradition has been constantly maligned in our society where it is now seen as taboo to associate with it. There are ‘useful unionists’, but to be one you have to be socially progressive - pro gay marriage and abortion - and you have to be pro Belfast Agreement to be seen as legitimate. Otherwise you are a non-entity.”He believes that the Belfast Agreement has been responsible for “the legitimisation process of those who engaged in terrorism and bloodshed and the demonisation of those who tried to protect our society”.But he is clear on the way forward: “The responsibility lies with our political parties and the loyal orders. There is no form or means for a young unionist to learn the political trade”.‘George’, a university graduate in his twenties, believes that the lack of desire from young unionists to engage politically comes from universities.“I have been in tutorials whereyou say anything that isn’t from the playbook of nationalism or Irish republicanism you are shot down immediately - shot down by other students and even lecturers - they don’t come to your assistance. Often they are cheering on the nationalist perspective.“If you suggest the security forces were right to fight terrorism and defend democracy and freedom - that is just not how the university will allow you to speak. The orthodoxy that is taught is that any discrimination, perceived or actual, against Catholics fully justied the IRA campaign. Protestant students are made to feel that they can’t speak up against that.”He believes these same dynamics are exactly the same as the pressures young unionists feel against speaking out in wider society and in the media. “Because that is putting your head above the parapet. The Irish republican version of NI history is now the accepted orthodoxy - it is historical revisionism. It is Northern Ireland’s version of cancel culture but it is far more effective here because it is policed by the IRA. “On the mainland it is policed by political correctness which is not nearly as powerful.”An Ulster Unionist Party spokesperson commented that it is committed to offering “a positive, confident brand of unionism as Northern Ireland enters its second century”. He added: “Our youth wing – the Ulster Young Unionists – has a presence on Northern Ireland’s University campuses and is open to students and non students alike.“They are encouraged to get involved in politics and regularly join canvass teams across Northern Ireland at election time. Some have gone on to become councillors and the Party is keen to promote new blood as part of the necessary and healthy process of change and renewal. Members of the Young Unionists have appeared on ious TV and radio shows – including the Nolan Show - and have been encouraged to do so. As a party we would encourage young unionists – whether aligned with the Ulster Unionist Party or not – to make their voices heard when opportunities present themselves.”:: Want to joint the conversation  Email [email#protected]MORE NEWS:Policing Board ‘not aware’ of existence of PSNI unit monitoring IRA activityPSNI reveals why Paramilitary Crime Task Force investigates UVF, UDA and INLA - but not the IRADUP MLA: I was assaulted at QUB for being a unionist activistQUB Students Union President in row over IRA Facebook postsQUB ‘silent’ on student social media rules after IRA Facebook rowSinn Fein law lecturer won’t condemn IRA murder of QUB academicLodge Le: investing in the future with Pioneers projectPanel to look at Protestant boys’ underachievement is ‘too imbalanced’A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThere were bizarre scenes at Brentford’s Community Stadium as both sets of players were forced off the pitch for almost  minutes while a drone hovered above.The flying nuisance eventually buzzed off to allow play to get back under way, and Joao Moutinho put Wolves ahead before Toney equalised.But Ruben Neves brought the Bees crashing back down to earth as his late strike condemned them to a - loss, their sixth defeat in seven matches.“It was a tough one to take,” said Toney. “I felt that when we got the equaliser it was only going to go one way, which was our way.“But obviously the quality they showed from the edge of the box, they’ve got the quality to do that.“It was tough but we can’t use it as an excuse. Both teams had the stoppage. Obviously you’ve got to stay focused and keep on the move.“I felt that when we came back out from the pause for the drone we started sloppy. But it’s stops and starts and we can’t do anything about that.“You’ve got to go out and continue with the game and they coped with it well and got the three points.”Toney’s goal, a fine volley from Bryan Mbeumo’s free-kick, took his tally for the season to seven.The -year-old feels Brentford need to use the international break to “reset” and get back to winning ways before they get sucked into trouble.“I feel there’s something we can take out of the game, we have to look forward now and try to change it in the next game,” he added.“On a personal note it was another one for the tally but it’s much sweeter when there’s three points behind it.“It’s time to reset. Obviously we’re on a bad run, we know that. But it’s not like we’ve been playing badly, we’re just conceding silly goals.“If we cut that out we’ve got a great chance. It’s time to restart and go again.”Wolves winger Adama Traore came on as a substitute amid reports linking him with Tottenham, and had a late goal ruled out for a tight offside..remove“The most important thing is the way he plays for us,” said boss Bruno Lage.“He played again with energy and scored the third ‘goal’ again.

I am not very body confident and the thought of putting on a swim suit horried me, and getting changed afterwards as well.”One of the dogs being looked after by Lucys TrustHowever, despite her fears, Geolin decided to be brave and take the plunge. “I wanted to challenge myself and thoughtI was going too do it I wanted to do it properly and learn how too swim in the sea,” she continued. “I looked for an open water swimming coach and Colin Mccard came very highly recommended.“I had my first lesson last April. It was freezing, I got cramp, I was terried, but, I loved it and have been taking open sea swimming lessons ever since. It took weeks too overcome my fears of being out of my depth, and actually learning how to swim, especially putting my face in the water, but it was all possible with the patience of a fantastic coach Colin. I feel ready to swim a distance and hopefully raise as much money as I can for the charity I volunteer at Lucy’s Trust.”Run by Olivia Kenned, who is a veterinary surgeon, and her partner Rob Durston, Lucy’s Trust, which is based near Lisburn, is a sanctuary for dogs who cannot be rehomed due to behavioural issues, or those that are in most need of a rescue place, and or assistance to overcome their dficulties to become happy healthy dogs once again.“This past two years has seen a signicant rise in the number of dogs Lucy’s Trust have been asked to take in with behavioural problems,” explained Geolin. “I am deeply saddened in the knowledge that many of these dogs are being put to sleep, young healthy dogs, who with the right commitment and guidance from their s could have gone on to live happy lives. This is not the fault of our struggling animal rescues, who can only take in the numbers they can actively care for.“Every rescue that I know of has been inundated with dogs in the last year. The current developing situation can only be referred to as a crisis. As a country we are failing our dogs on an unprecedented level, and I are really urging the general public to step up and take responsibility for the dog which they chose to procure. Please contact Lucy’s Trust for behavioural advice and recommendations for local positive reinforcement trainers who will help you to help your dog. Giving them up is not the answer, it is not a solution,”To help Lucy’s Trust continue their work, Geolin is planning to swim m- metres at Helen’s Bay.
