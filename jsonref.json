To illustrate this he recalled a maternal great aunt named Gertie once telling him in his youth that ‘your father is not a bad man. He’s just English’.He has also admitted that his mother was worried that as his political career progressed and he met the world’s top leaders he might let the side down with the Queen.Biden first met the monarch as a young senator. Just as he was leaving for the airport to fly to the UK, he recalled in a 2013 speech, his mother phoned him.‘Joey, be polite but do not kiss her ring,’ Biden told his audience she had instructed him, adding, as laughter broke out among listeners: ‘Swear to God.’Mr Biden repeated his mother’s concern about showing undue deference to the Queen in his autobiography, this time recalling: ‘When I told my mother I was going to have an audience with the Queen of England, the first thing she said was: “Don’t you bow down to her.” He went on: ‘ “Remember Joey,” she’d say, “you’re a Biden. Nobody is better than you.” ’Painting his mother’s defiance as one of spirited refusal to kowtow to power rather than a hatred of the British, Mr Biden also said she’d told him not to be obsequious to the Pope either when he met him.However, it’s difficult to imagine Mrs Biden — a staunch Roman Catholic — reacting so violently to the idea of sleeping in His Holiness’s former hotel bed as she reportedly did over the Queen.Described by genealogist Megan Smolenyak (who investigated Mr Biden’s roots) as ‘quintessential Irish-American’, Jean’s father, Ambrose, was a newspaper librarian while her mother was the daughter of a state senator.Mr Biden has recalled how while at a grammar school run by nuns, one of them had once mocked his stuttering. His mother — just 5 ft 1 in — stormed into the school and told the nun: ‘If you ever speak to my son like that again, I’ll come back and rip that bonnet off your head.’ The Queen may have got off lightly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9e77394f6113e2c7722948b730641eb83263b74/0_200_7161_4294/master/7161.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=09c90a91fc0b4e4c6d5ace666ceb2aa4","title":"the artist who removes skin colour and boundaries in pictures","story":"“My paintings are based on the human aura,” he says. “I paint over them with white because I think it gives it a soulful look and creates a sense of inward expression… when I eliminate the skin colour, it removes the boundary that makes us limit our humanity and the ways we can imagine ourselves existing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0f0c7dc2973efca7f954d62700af8cd8881d7d0/3_0_10661_6400/master/10661.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=692506e667fcdbdce127d62d9833574a","title":"super bowl the ads the music and everything but the football live","story":"They won!

But more importantly, we witnessed one of the most compelling half-time shows for years, the first time that hip-hop (with a little help from R\u0026ampB) took centre stage at the year’s biggest concert. The combination of Dr Dre, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem, Snoop Dogg and Mary J Blige (with a little from 50 Cent and Anderson .Paak) proved to be a winner, taking us all back to the early 2000s with some throwback hits before bringing us back to the almost present thanks to Kendrick. There were also some never-not-needed jabs at the NFL and police brutality thanks to Eminem and Dr Dre. The ads were curious.

The Rams have won Super Bowl LVI!Okay, NBC is about to switch out to coverage of the Winter Olympics, so that means that it’s about time for us to shut down this live blog. Thanks to everybody who contributed their emails and tweets, sorry that I couldn’t fit them all during this action-packed Super Bowl. As promised, we had a tight game that wasn’t decided until the literal last minute. You can’t ask for a better end of the NFL season than that. Do stick around for further coverage from the  as we will break down the Los Angeles Rams’ impressive Super Bowl victory over the coming days.“I don’t feel deserving of this,” he says. That’s absolutely not true, he ended up having to be the majority of the Rams’ offense after Beckham went down.As per usual, we’ll keep this live blog going until the trophy presentation.It was almost set up for Aaron Donald to make the game-clinching defensive play.The Bengals just let the clock run down as Stafford kneels down to end the game. The Rams have won Super Bowl LVI!After another touchback, the Bengals will start on their own 25. Burrow finds Chase for a 17-yard gain that will take them to their own 42-yard line. That’s a quick start. On the next play, Burrow finds Boyd for a nine-yard gain that takes them nearly to midfield. Second and one, Burrow throws one long and wide. Third and one, with the clock ticking. Perine doesn’t pick up the yards. The Bengals take a timeout. After the timeout, Aaron Donald takes down Burrow on fourth down! That’s almost certainly going to do it!First and goal, there’s a pass interference call on the defense. That means it’s first and goal at the one-yard line. A lot has gone on here, without anything happening. Stafford takes it himself but doesn’t get close to the touchdown. The Bengals take a timeout. Second and goal, Stafford FINALLY hits that touchdown to, you guessed it, Cooper Kupp! The extra point is good, and now the Bengals have just 1.25 to try to tie this one up ... or more. Can they do it again?Stafford’s third pass is incomplete to Kupp but there’s a holding call on the Bengals defense. It feels iffy given the circumstances, but so it goes. So it’s first and goal at the Bengals four here. On the next play, Stafford seems to throw a touchdown pass to Kupp but there’s a flag. There’s holding on the offense and unnecessary roughness on the defense, so that means offsetting penalties. So we’re replaying first down now.Stafford’s second pass just hits the ground. Third down and goal.What the Bengals need here, badly, is an interception or a fumble recovery.  First and then, Stafford finds Akers for three yards. Second and seven, Stafford throws to Kupp for a 22-yard gain! They’re at the Bengals’ 24-yard line and things are getting dicey for Cincinnati here! First and 10, of course Stafford is going to find Kupp again. This completion is worth eight yards and it takes them to the Bengals 16. Akers, neutralized this entire game, goes off for an eight-yard gain!  At the two-minute warning, the Rams are eight yards away from their opponents’ end zone with a new set of downs.The Rams are at their own 37. Stafford tries to find Akers, but he can’t. He then goes with Kupp again for an eight-yard gain. On third and two, Stafford hits Hopkins for a six-yard gain that gets them into Bengals territory. Yes, I wrote “putting unit” a few updates ago and not “punting unit.” Sometimes spell-check isn’t sufficient. Meanwhile, Stafford finds Hopkins for a nine-yard gain on first down. Smart move not brining Michel back out there. On second and one, Stafford’s pass is incomplete. Third and one, they opt to rush and Akers can’t quite get there. Big fourth down decision. You have to think they go for it here at their own 30. They do! Kupp takes the ball ad runs! He picks up seven yards for a first down! That might have saved the Rams’ season!First and 10, Burrow finds Mixon for a three-yard loss. He’s looking a little more comfortable now. It’s second and 13 now, Mixon picks up four yards. A massive third and nine situation here and Burrow finds Boyd with a perfect pass that the usually sure-handed Boyd somehow just drops.  Huber’s punt will put the Rams at their own 21. Let’s see if they can make the Bengals pay for what looks like a massive missed opportunity with that dropped first-down pass.Meanwhile, the Bengals are doing good running on first down, which is important because Burrow is out there but it doesn’t look like he’s fully right. Mixon picks up 12 yards on first down for, well, another first down. At the Bengals’ own 28, Mixon picks up eight yards. Second and two, Mixon gets stuffed for no gain. Then we have Burrow’s first throw, a three-yard pass to Evans for a first down. The Bengals are at their own 39.Sony Michel gets the ball on second and third and gets pushed back. On third down, Stafford throws short and that’s one of the briefest possessions you will see without a turnover. Here comes the punting unit. Hekker pins the Bengals to their own 16.  Let’s see if Burrow is coming out and, if so, how healthy he looks.Joe Burrow’s injury, it looks to be his right knee, has cast a pall over this game. Hopefully, he can return like Stafford did.  Speaking of Stafford, he finds Jefferson for a seven-yard gain to their own 42-yard line.Burrow throws incomplete to Higgins on second and nine. On third down, the Rams defense blitzes Burrow, who looks shaken in the aftermath. He limps off and he’s holding his leg in pain and this looks worse than Stafford’s foot injury. There was a flag for unnecessary roughness after the end of the play, on Isaiah Prince. There’s a 14-yard penalty on the Bengals before they punt. At their own 14, Huber’s 54-yard punt is returned by the Rams to their own 35.The ever-present Mixon picks up a yard on first down. On second down, Burrow absolutely nails Boyd with a perfect pass for 16 yards. The Bengals are at their own 33. Mixon, once again, gets the ball on first down and gives them a single yard.On second and five, Akers gets pushed back to the Bengals 49. It’s third and seven now, Stafford throws very, very deep to Jefferson, but he’s utterly swamped by defenders. The Rams punt and pin the Bengals to their own 16.As expected, Stafford is back out there. Akers picks up five yards on first down, getting the Rams to the Bengals’ 47-yard line and that ends up being the final play of the third quarter. Only 15 minutes left in regulation everybody!Stafford is walking around, but man it looks like he hurt his ankle pretty bad on that sack. I would imagine if there’s any way he can stay on the field, we will see him on the next Rams offensive possession. It is Burrow’s time to get sacked here, a two-yard loss courtesy of A’Shawn Robinson. On the next player, it’s Von Miller who gets to Burrow, pushing Burrow back 10 yards. The Bengals now have a third and 22 at their own four-yard line. Not ideal. Burrow finds Mike Thomas for a 17-yard gain. All that will do is giving more space for the punter, the announcers point out correctly. Huber’s punt will put the Rams at their own 48-yard line.Stafford connects with Jefferson for a loss of a single-yard and we get a timeout for an injured player. It looks to be Awuzie for the Bengals defense. It’s second and 11 at the Rams 46. Stafford passes to Akers who picks up four yards. The next play could be very significant: DJ Reader sacks Stafford for a six-yard loss that forces the Rams to punt. More than that, Stafford limps out of the field and immediately gets examined. The punt will put the Bengals at their own 16.Rams defense steps up huge here. Ernest Jones sacks Burrow for seven yards and his third-down pass to Chase is incomplete, somewhat shockingly. Here comes the punting team. Powell takes Huber’s punt to the Los Angeles 47. Solid starting position for the Rams on the other side of a commercial break.Gay’s kick goes into the end zone for a touchback. I really should just set up a keyboard shortcut for that phrase, it would save me precious seconds.  The Bengals start at their own 25 where Mixon picks up four yards on first down.Stafford finds Skowronek for a seven-yard gain. On second and three, however, Akers goes backwards two yards. That puts the Rams back at the Cincinnati 23.  On third and five, they try a trick play of their own, but Cooper Kupp is no Joe Mixon and he can’t find a wide open Stafford for a first down. It’s fourth down and here comes the field goal unit. Henderson picks up a single yard on first down. It’s second and nine at their own 43. Stafford finds Kupp for a 13-yard gain to the Bengals 44.  Stafford goes to Hopkins for a 16-yard gain and they’re already at the Cincinnati 28. He looks determined to tie this back up right here.McPherson’s kick hits the end zone for another touchback. Let’s see if this offensive possession goes better for the Rams. Akers runs for … a two-yard gain to the LA 27. On second and 10, Stafford throws incomplete. It’s third and eight now and it would be deflating for this drive to die here. It doesn’t! Stafford finds Henderson who picks up 15 yards and takes them to their own 42.The Bengals now have a touchdown lead and if they can hold on, and there is a lot of time still to go, that period will be remembered as the turning point. The Rams, however, have something to say about that.Mixon picks up two yards to the Los Angeles 16. On second and eight, Burrow finds Uzomah for another five yards. On third and three, Aaron Donald does what Aaron Donald does: he sacks Burrow for a nine-yard loss that is going to force a field goal here. That’s probably LA’s best case scenario here. McPherson doesn’t miss field goals in the postseason so the kick is good and the Bengals tack onto their lead.Burrow passes to Mixon for no gain and then is sacked for a one-yard loss on the next play. It is third and 11 on the Rams 32. The Rams’ defense is coming up big right when they desperately need it to. Burrow finds Chase for a 10-yard gain. So, it’s fourth-and-one and the Bengals have a decision to make here. And they go for it! Burrow doesn’t just quarterback sneak, he picks up four yards to the Rams’ 18-yard line.What is going on here? The Rams take McPherson’s kickoff to their own 17-yard line. On their very first offensive play of the second half, Stafford throws an interception right to Chidobe Awuzie! The Bengals get the ball again and will start at the LA 31. This game has turned almost instantly!Oh wow, that’s super-fast! Burrow finds Higgins for a 75-yard touchdown pass. Jalen Ramsey wanted a face mask call there, but he didn’t get one. After a successful extra-point attempt, Cincinnati takes a four-point lead!Bengals get the ball to start the second half. After a touchback, the Bengals start on their own 25. Burrow finds Boyd for 11 yards, that takes them to their own 36."},{"url":null,"title":"inflation nation 15 ways to save money","story":"For many Irish households the cost of groceries is second only to a mortgage or rentThere’s been some talk of rising prices and shopping around of late and Pricewatch can’t help feel a bit miffed at the casual fashion some folk have invaded our territory. But we will leave our grievances at the top of the page and continue to plough our lonely little furrow. With many Irish homes already to the pin of their collar when it comes to making savings – and have done all the shopping around they can do – there are still savings on the table for others. Here are just some of them.Food for thoughtThe hikes: For many Irish households the cost of groceries is second only to a mortgage or rent – although for those homes where childcare is a requirement, food will most likely come in a distant third. If a total of €150 is spent in supermarkets each week, the annual spend comes in at just under eight grand – a figure which does not allow for any class of Christmas blowout or deviation from normal spending patterns. Official figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) suggest food inflation has been modest so far this year –although increasing alarmingly fast in some areas – and the latest data from retail analysts Kantar suggests that grocery prices have climbed by 1.7 per cent over the last 12 months. People coming out of supermarkets are counting the real cost of the spike and it seems to be substantially more than 1.7 per cent. If a typical house spends just €15 more each week over the next year than they did in 2021, they will see their shopping bills climb by €780 between now and next February. Is there anything to be done?The tips: 1. You have to be a supermarket ninja and only buy why you need. Do not let yourself be swept off your feet by the two-for-one or buy-one-get-one-free offers dangled before you as you go up and down the aisle.2. Before you walk through the supermarket doors do your homework. Survey what you have in your cupboards and your freezer and then make a list based on that and what you plan to eat for the next seven days. Email the list to yourself, then paste it into your notes app and then as each item is added to your trolley or basket delete it from the note. Buy nothing else. Trust us this works.3. Never shop hungry. We have said it before and we will say it again. A hungry shopper is never ninja-like.4. Experiment more with own-brand products. While we have increased the percentage of generic supermarket shopping from less than 10 per cent little over a decade ago, to around 40 per cent today, we are still a long way adrift of other countries. Making some smart switches could handily see the cost of your weekly shop fall by 20 per cent. Not all of it is great – we’re looking at you cornflakes and cola – but there will be things on the shelves that are not branded which are as good – if not better – than familiar brands you throw in your trolley without thinking. Own-brand Mayonnaise in Tesco, for instance, costs €2.60 per litre while a more familiar brand of the same product sells on the same shelf for €5 a litre.The savings: Even if you manage to shave just 5 per cent off your annual grocery shopping bill you could handily save yourself hundreds of euro between now and next February.The hikes: The cost of heating and lighting our homes has climbed dramatically since this time last year with all the main companies rolling out multiple price hikes, blaming soaring prices of fossil fuels on global markets. The upshot is most households will be paying around €700 to €800 more for their gas and electricity this year with the story even more bleak for those who are with some of the smaller suppliers who have imposed price hikes that will add over €1,300 to their customers’ annual bills.The tips: 1. While every company has increased their prices, every company offers substantial discounts – sometimes of over 30 per cent – to new customers. So be that new customer. Moving provider is easy and – unlike switching cornflakes or cola – the end product is identical with the only difference being price. Get copies of your most recent gas or electricity bill, or both if you’re a dual fuel customer. Note your Gas Point Reference Number (GPRN) or Meter Point Reference Number (MPRN) and take a current gas andor electricity meter reading, so your old supplier can provide you with a final bill and your new supplier can start from that point. Then make the call. You will be on hold for some time but if you can save €500 it will be worth it.2. We are not suggesting you turn off your heat, although the grim reality is that many people have no choice but to do that. But were you to turn the thermostat down by one degree you would reduce your heating energy consumption by up to 10 per cent which might save you €100.3. Cooking more than one thing at a time makes your oven more efficient and resist opening the oven door while cooking, as 20 per cent of the heat escapes each time. Put lids on pots boiling on the stove and always turn down the heat when water starts to boil.4. Do not leave electrical items on standby and look at ways to make your home cosier by plugging gaps – we’re not talking about retrofitting here because, while it makes sense in the long term, in the short term it can be very pricey indeed, even with any grants that are on the table. Try and get your hands on a home energy savings kit from your local library. It allows you to easily gauge how much energy you actually use and work out when your heat is going.The savings: The big switch is where the big savings are to be found but the other steps can make a small difference too.The hikes:  According to the CSO petrol prices have climbed 32 per cent over the last year, while diesel prices have gone by 36 per cent. Many motorists will have experienced that unpleasant sensation of watching as the fuel pump price gauge tips over into three digits before the decimal point. The price of fuel fluctuates from forecourt to forecourt but a rise of close to 50 cent per litre is pretty typical. When spread out over a full 12 months, increases of that level are going to cost motorists a lot of money. How much? The average Irish motorist drives around 16,000km a year so based on pump prices last year, that annual cost of petrol was €1,550. Based on today’s prices, fuel costs, when spread over the next 12 months, will be €2,258. Keen students of maths will have already worked out that this represents an increase of €708 when compared to just one year ago. That is not all. The cost of using Ireland’s toll roads a has gone up by 10 cent so if you use pass through them on the way to and from work five days a week for 46 weeks a year you will be down a further €46.The tips:  1. The best way to save money when it comes to cars is not to use them. If you could reduce the amount of time you used your car by 20 per cent – by walking or cycling maybe – then you will knock €220 off your annual costs.2. Knocking even 5 cent off the price you pay for fuel, meanwhile will save you another €60 over the course of a year. And how might you do that? First get out of the habit of throwing €20 or €40 worth of fuel into your car or filling it. Instead buy a set number of litres, which will make you aware of the price gaps between forecourts. Check out pumps.ie for prices, in your neighbourhood.3. You can also save a surprising amount of money by changing the way you drive. Do not over-rev your engine, drive in the right gear and keep your boot empty. Keep tyres at the right pressure, get the car serviced, do not use air conditioning and remove roof racks. Do all this and you will save a further €100.The hikes:  The price of a pint is on the way up – and a 20 cent increase will see a person who drinks five scoops a week worse off by more than €50 over the course of the next 12 months. Sky increased the cost of its TV packages by 3.4 per cent in recent weeks, while last year Netflix announced a 13 per cent price hike to its premium package while Disney+ announced a 29 per cent price hike to its service. If you have both of these plans you will be paying €324 a year, up €48 on last year. GoMo has increased the price of its sim-only deal by over 15 per cent to €14.99 a month for new customers while Eir implemented a €6 a month increase to many of its broadband and phone plans back. In an odd move Three has said that it plans to increase the monthly charge on its billpay plans by 4.5 per cent every year, starting in April while Vodafone is to increase prices by the rate of inflation plus 3 per cent every year, starting in April too.The tips: 1. By auditing your streaming services and subscriptions you might be able to save a few bob. The good news is such an audit is neither as tedious or as difficult as it once might have been and technology is now your friend. Go through your bank statement online looking for all payments to online services. Work out which ones you use and which ones you do not – if you have not used a service even once in the last month cancel it.2. Sometimes the easiest way to make savings is to make a fuss. If you are getting your broadband and television from Company A then call then and threaten to leave. There is a very good chance they will offer you some class of financial incentive to stay with them. And if they do not then leave.The hikes: Health care inflation is likely to surpass the rate of general inflation this year, which means many people with private health insurance are likely to face more hikes as the year progresses. With the cost of visiting a GP around €70 and the pries of some products in pharmacies also on the way up, people who become ill will likely see a hit in their wallet too over the course of the next year.The tips: 1. For more than two million private health insurance is a luxury they cannot afford. And many of those who do have it are paying too much. If your renewal is coming up, call your insurer and ask for all the comparable plans to the one you have that cost less and use the Health Insurance Authority website to make comparisons (hia.ie) between your provider and others on the market. You might be able to save yourself hundreds of euro with just a couple of hours work.2. Make sure to claim the tax relief on the cost of health expenses. There is 20 per cent tax back on the table for health and medical expenses and non-routine dental expenses."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education."},{"url":null,"title":"record 14 000 teachers absent from school last month due to covid 19","story":"Department of Education figures show the number of teacher absences climbed from 9,278 in December to 14,390, a 55 per cent increase. Photograph: iStockA record 14,000 teachers were absent for Covid reasons last month as schools struggled to find enough staff to keep classes open.Department of Education figures provided to The  show the number of teacher absences climbed from 9,278 in December to 14,390 in January, a 55 per cent increase.These teachers were absent for a range of reasons including having Covid-19 symptoms, testing positive or being identified as a close contact.The figures understate the full scale of absences as they do not include teachers absent in about 270 schools run by Education and Training Boards.Teachers’ unions and school managers have warned in recent days that many schools were continuing to struggle to find enough substitute teachers, despite a reduction in the level of Covid-19 in the wider population.While the release of hundreds of student teachers into classrooms has played a key role in supporting schools, there is concern that many are due to return to college from the end of this week.Department of Education figures show the extent to which the system has been under pressure over recent months.A total of 3,250 teachers were absent for Covid reasons in October last year, rising to 9,199 in November, 9,278 in December and 14,390 in January of this year.The overall level of teacher absences, meanwhile, has also resulted in soaring spending on substitute teachers.It is estimated that the cost for substitute teachers in 2021 will be in the region of €300 million, up from €244 million the previous year.Minister for Education Norma Foley has said this enhanced substitute cover has played a key role in keeping schools open.At primary level a total of 680 teachers are employed on a full-time basis on teacher supply panels which cover about 2,700 schools.In addition, there have also been changes which permit teachers on career breaks to do unlimited substitution, as well as changes to allow job-sharing teachers carry out substitute work on the days they are rostered off.The department said its inspectorate was continuing to provide support to schools where they continued to experience difficulties in sourcing sufficient substitute cover.Public health adviceMeanwhile, new advice on whether face masks should remain mandatory in schools is expected later this week.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) is due to meet on Thursday to review safety measures in schools such as mask wearing, physical distancing and other limits on school activities.Updated guidance is due to issue in advance of the return of school following the mid-term break, which begins on Friday.Séamus Mulconry, general secretary of the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, which supports more than 2,800 primary schools, has urged a cautious easing of restrictions.“The pandemic may be over for much of the public, but it is not over for schools,” he said.“We’re seeing high level of absences among staff and pupils. The lack of substitute cover has re-emerged as a really serious issue for schools.”The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) said any relaxation of school infection control measures should be delayed for at least two more months unless public health authorities can confirm the situation in primary schools will improve dramatically in the coming weeks.INTO general secretary John Boyle said he believed the level of infection within primary schools had not been captured properly.He said the “scrapping” of public health risk assessments in schools, along with contact tracing and PCR testing, meant the system was being kept in the dark.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"gp shortages are affecting tens of thousands of people","story":"People relocating to rural areas to avoid rising housing costs in cities are adding to the pressure on GP surgeries, with some practices closing their lists to new patients. Photograph: Andrew MatthewsPA Tens of thousands of people are affected by a “severe” shortage of family doctors as new figures show 13 GP areas for medical card holders have been without a permanent physician for a year or longer. Health Service Executive figures show there are 26 vacancies for doctors on General Medical Services (GMS) panels covering more than 17,000 medical card holders. More than half of these vacancies are in towns and villages in rural areas. The numbers do not include tens of thousands more private patients served by GPs in these areas. The Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) has warned of a “severe” shortage of GPs with 2,000 doctors required to cover current shortages and doctors due to retire over the next five to 10 years.It has called on Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly to establish a working group on the future of general practice to seek “innovative” solutions to “the GP workforce crisis”. ‘Stark statistic’Dr John Farrell, a GP based in in Cahir, Co Tipperary, and chairman of the ICGP board, said the shortage was a “major issue” for healthcare in communities.“While the 26 vacant panels is a fairly stark statistic, that is 26 towns and villages without a GP which is affecting tens of thousands of people,” he said.The numbers affected increased significantly when the number of GP surgeries with vacancies for doctors or who cannot find locums was added, he said. He said people relocating to rural areas to avoid rising housing costs in cities added to the pressure on GP surgeries, with some practices having closed their lists to new patients. “We are not training enough doctors and there are not enough doctors going into general practice,” he said.Rural practicesThe ICGP plans to increase the number of GPs trained a year to 350 from 250 currently.Dr Denis McCauley, chair of the GP committee of the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), said it had “to sell general practice again” to young doctors and that new flexible arrangements were needed to attract doctors discouraged by long out-of-hours work in single-handed rural practices. Locations where GMS panel jobs have remained vacant for a year or longer include Monaghan with 741 medical card holders Kilkenny city and Ballyragget, Co Kilkenny (604), and Clifden, Co Galway (560). The HSE said vacant panels represent less than 1 per cent of the 2,500 GMS GPs working nationally. Cover is arranged through “a locum or other appropriate arrangement to maintain services in communities until the vacant panel is filled”, it said.Dr McCauley noted the added benefits of “continuous care by the same practice team”, saying people who know they can easily access a regular GP tend not to attend as often.

Divisions at the top of the organisation spilled into the open over the weekend, days after it admitted using “false quotations” when claiming a €52,100 government grant in 2020. The money was never released, and the Department of Sport suspended its access to capital funding for 12 months. President of Cycling Ireland and board chairman Liam Collins called on Saturday night for three board resignations, saying in a statement to some 22,000 members that he himself would stand down before an annual general meeting scheduled for November. But board members remained in situ following a meeting yesterday. In a statement last night, directors noted Mr Collins’s remarks and said they were issued “on his own behalf”. The statement said: “The board is acutely conscious that the members of the company rightly feel that recent events do nothing to serve the interests of the sport of cycling.”Asked whether Mr Collins was at the board meeting, a spokesman said he was invited but did not attend. “He has received all board communications and documentation subsequent to that meeting,” the spokesman said. In its statement, the board said it was writing to the Department of Sport and Sport Ireland “to advise them of the issues that appear to have given rise” to the president’s communication. “In addition, the board will engage with Sport Ireland in relation to the appointment of additional directors, as suggested by the president.”Board ‘overhaul’The directors resolved to convene an extraordinary general meeting of Cycling Ireland, the trading company for the Irish Cycling Federation, to inform members of the issues. Mr Collins had said he was not opposed to an egm but believed “the more sensible approach” was to pursue a board overhaul. Cycling Ireland, the governing body for the sport on the island of Ireland, received almost €10 million in public money in the five years to 2020. Reports in The  one week ago on a critical internal audit that found errors, ineptitude and governance failings in Cycling Ireland are said to have stirred tension at the top of the organisation.In a statement circulated via email to members and published on Cycling Ireland’s website, Mr Collins said Sport Ireland should assist with new board appointments. “Having recently been elected as president of Cycling Ireland, I can state with certainty that board relations are far from ideal and there appears to be little prospect of matters improving in the near future,” said Mr Collins, an accountant based in Co Limerick. “It is a regretful situation, but it is a fact that the members of Cycling Ireland are not being served by a unified, cohesive board.”Work togetherIn their statement, the directors said they shared Mr Collins’ desire for a “unified and cohesive” board. “The best way to achieve that objective is for the board to work together to rebuild relationships and address the issues facing the company. The board is committing to making that happen.” A spokesman for Sport Ireland did not reply to phone calls yesterday. Sport Ireland is the State supervisor of national governing bodies for sports, Cycling Ireland among them. The Department of Sport said it had no comment “at this time” when asked about Mr Collins’ statement. Both the department and Sport Ireland have said the release of any 2022 funding to Cycling Ireland depends on whether it implements reforms recommended in the internal audit report, which was carried out by Kosi Corporation.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"richard o halloran s return quiet diplomacy kept him in china three years","story":" Richard O’Halloran  at his home in Foxrock, Dublin, after he returned home following three years of detention in   China. Photograph: Laura HuttonThe Even at the end of his ordeal, almost three years after he was first detained in China, Dublin businessman Richard O’Halloran remained nervous and paranoid on his flight home late last month.After years of “always looking over my shoulder” in China, he feared his return flight from Seoul to Paris could still be erted to a Chinese airport as he flew west over China.“In a moment of madness, I thought: ‘Do I ask the pilot to fly north?’” he told The .“Going back over Chinese airspace at the back of my mind was like, will they ground this plane? Had they a change of mind? They might still be going through paperwork and thinking: ‘We have one last chance to stop this guy. We know the flight he is on.’”He tracked the plane icon closely on his in-flight monitor until it left Chinese airspace. After previous failed attempts to leave, he realised finally he was on his way home. He was free.“Relieved” and “epic” is how he described his January 29th return almost three years after he became embroiled in a legal dispute between the Chinese chairman of the Dublin aircraft leasing company he works for and a Shanghai court over tens of millions of euros raised from Chinese investors that was used to buy an Airbus aircraft that is now leased out.Sitting in the kitchen of his Foxrock home, a reflective and emotional O’Halloran is still decompressing from the trauma of his detention and long-held fears sitting in Shanghai hotels, apartments and courts that he might not return to his wife Tara and their four children again.‘A whirlwind’His last, frantic week in China dealing with the judge overseeing the case, his arrival back in Dublin and meeting his family in an airport lounge after years apart were “a whirlwind.”“It was just like a compression of time into one moment,” he said of that emotional reunion with his family.The selfie photo by his ecstatic daughter Bella with a beaming Richard and his family in the background posted by Tara on Twitter “encapsulates three years in one shot,” he said.He is loving the simple things of family life: the school run, the hustle and bustle of the their busy home - “even emptying the dishwasher,” he said.“It is great to be around family, great to be around people and loved ones and not being alone. The isolation is the killer, no companionship,” he said.“Despair is probably the word,” said Tara of his time in China. “It was a horrendous three years, but we kind of feel like we have been given a second chance now that he is back.”The happy home life they are living now is a far cry from O’Halloran’s lowest moments in China. It began when he voluntarily travelled to China in 2019 to meet investors and try to resolve “the whole rigmarole” around a crowdfunding investment that predated his time in the company.When he went to leave China, he was blocked. It was the start of a painful court process for O’Halloran as the Chinese sought the return of the plane or about €30 million of investors’ money.By the second half of 2020, nothing was resolved. He was stuck in endless court hearings, yet never accused of any crime. He felt abandoned by the Irish Government, with the Department of Foreign Affairs telling him it was “a commercial matter and they couldn’t get involved.”Stress and anxietyHe stopped sleeping and eating and, alone in hotels, he started drinking heavily. The stress and anxiety grew and eventually led to pain, back spasms and seizures. He lost 20 kilos.At one point, he was rushed to hospital where he collapsed and woke up two days later.His family had been warned against speaking out publicly to the media for fear of antagonising the Chinese but with her husband’s health deteriorating, Tara could not sit back.“There was nothing being done. There was no urgency. I was crying down the phone to Simon Coveney saying ‘you have to help us, he is going to die’,” she said.Mr O’Halloran cannot pinpoint what led him to turn things around but throughout last year he made every effort to assist the Chinese court in the complicated enforcement process around reaching an agreement on the future of the plane and its planned return to the investors in 2026.“I just came to a realisation that I had Tara, the kids and if something happened to me, it was very serious,” he said.He realised he needed to build trust with the Chinese to pave the way for his release, fulfilling every request for documentation and going well beyond what was requested.Last month, after 50 or 60 visits to court over the years, the judge came to his apartment, asking Mr O’Halloran for a promise he would do “x, y and z” about the plane. They shook hands and the judge gave him the document lifting the exit ban.“Maybe it was a gesture,” he said of the judge’s unusual visit.‘Quiet diplomacy’Looking back, Richard and Tara believe that the importance of the State’s trade with China prevented the Government from being more forceful in its dealings with the Chinese over his case.“Quiet diplomacy is what kept him there three years, not what got him home,” she said.“There was never a statement of protest. There was never any senior person outright saying that we ‘condemn this’, that he is ‘being held against his will’.”Richard is thankful for Mr Coveney’s help on his case but believes the Minister was badly advised initially and that a suggestion that there was “no smoke without fire” around Mr O’Halloran that might deterred more intensive efforts by the department.He believes this that might have cost him a year. He claims that it took businessman Ulick McEvaddy - someone the Minister knew - joining the board of his company to encourage Mr Coveney to become more involved.“It shouldn’t have taken Ulick as a private sector inidual to sway the Minister to get involved,” he said.A source close to the Minister said that Mr Coveney was actively involved in Mr O’Halloran’s case long before Mr Evaddy joined the board.In response to queries on its handling of the case, a spokeswoman for Mr Coveney’s department said the Government was “actively engaged on and remained committed to the matter throughout.”“There was at all stages very extensive engagement on Mr O’Halloran’s case at the most senior political and diplomatic levels - stressing the urgent importance of Mr O’Halloran being allowed to return home as soon as possible,” she said.“This involved multiple channels - with engagement by the Taoiseach, Minister Simon Coveney and the most senior political levels in Dublin as well as by our most senior diplomats in Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere throughout Ireland’s diplomatic network.”‘Bizarre’Mr O’Halloran said it was “bizarre” that Mr Coveney thanked the Chinese authorities in a public statement released by the department on the day he was allowed to leave China.“Did John O’Grady and his family thank Dessie O’Hare for releasing him minus the tops of his two little fingers?” he said, referring to the 1987 kidnapping and torture of the Dublin dentist.Tara said that the statement was “very upsetting” for his family and his mother.Describing himself as “an eternal optimist”, O’Halloran accepts he “cannot buy back time” lost with family, but he has come back “emotionally much stronger”, having given up alcohol and with a new-found and deep understanding of stress and anxiety, and what it can do to the body.“We are so proud of him that he has turned his life around and he has come away stronger,” said Tara, sitting next to her husband.Mr O’Halloran described the experience as “character-defining” and a “spiritual awakening” making him realise what he values most in life. He also recognises what his “phenomenal” wife Tara did over the past three years and the loyal support of family and friends.“It is very humbling. You understand what love is properly. You understand what companionship is,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"ghanaians urged to choose chocolate over valentine s day vices","story":"Mabel Sallah, a sales manager for Cobean’z. Photograph: Sally HaydenGhana is celebrating its 18th National Chocolate Day, and its second National Chocolate Week, with the now annual push from cocoa companies for Ghanaians to eat more chocolate.The annual event began in 2005 when then tourism minister Jake Obetsebi-Lamptey announced that St Valentine’s Day would be replaced by a celebration of chocolate, in a bid to encourage citizens of the world’s second largest cocoa producer to consume more of the crop themselves.In 2020 current tourism minister Barbara Oteng Gyasi also said the redesignation of February 14th as National Chocolate Day had helped to “minimise social vices associated with the celebration of Valentine’s Day”.For the past week a temporarily set up “Chocolate City”, beside Accra Mall in the west African nation’s capital, has been operating. An array of companies set up stalls as locals were enticed in by cook-offs, a poetry competition, a “ladies night” and a scheduled rave.The slogan of the week, on banners across the venue, are “eat chocolate, stay healthy, grow Ghana”. Over a loudspeaker the announcer extolled what he said were the health benefits of eating more cocoa, including a reduced risk of stroke. A leaflet for Prime Cocoa Products Ltd promoted cocoa as good for skin, the brain and fertility.“It has been busy,” said Adjontey Ficial Love, the company’s marketing manager. “It is important for us to celebrate this because we produce cocoa and we are meant to consume it, so we are sensitising the public on why they should eat it more,” she said, adding that people living abroad should also come to Ghana to “have a feel” of the “quality” cocoa there.So sweet“Everybody’s loving chocolate week,” said Kobby Owusu, who was worked the event three years in a row as part of the media department for the Chocolate Mall Company, which was selling chocolate-covered peanuts and strawberry-flavoured chocolate spread, among other products. “Everybody should eat cocoa every day in drinks, in spreads. Valentine’s Day is important because it brings families and loved ones together to eat cocoa. Just imagine you have chocolate in your mouth to give to your partner, it tastes so sweet.”“Other people think Valentine’s Day is about sex, sex, sex, but it is a day for love and chocolate,” said Mabel Sallah, a sales manager for Cobean’z, which makes spices with a cocoa base, and Dr Jany, which produces chocolate facial scrub cinnamon, cocoa and shea butter lip balm and a cocoa-based herbal foot treatment. “In Ghana we use cocoa as a symbol of love. It’s important because it helps our economy,” she said.Speaking at the launch of National Chocolate Week, minister of information Kojo Oppong-Nkrumah told journalists that Ghana had a target of 1kg per capita cocoa consumption, but was currently at just over 0.55kg per person.In 2017, Euromonitor International found that the average Irish person ate 7.7kg of chocolate in a year.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"maureen dowd washington dc and james joyce both incomprehensible","story":"James Joyce’s Ulysses: Hard because it’s great, or do people assume it’s great because it’s hard? Photograph: Barry CroninAFP via Getty Images I was in an Uber on Broadway in New York City when suddenly the world began violently shaking. A van had rammed the Uber. I was stunned, but I was also determined not to miss this semester’s first day of in-person classes at Columbia University, where I’m studying for a master’s in English literature. I gave the driver my information and ran to class. When I got there, I tried to breathe slowly and assess the damage. Was my brain functioning okay? The words in the book before me were swimming past incomprehensibly. “Ineluctable modality of the visible.” “Limits of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane.” “Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, frate porcospino. Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted. Call away let him: thy quarrons dainty is. Language no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.”Did I have a concussion, or was it just that I was reading Ulysses? On this centenary of James Joyce’s colossus, we can borrow a thought from WB Yeats’s poem The Fascination of What’s Difficult: Is Ulysses hard because it’s great, or do people assume it’s great because it’s hard? “It’s hard because Joyce put a lot in there,” Dan Mulhall, the Irish ambassador to the United States, told me. “A lot of people are drawn to the novel because of its complexity and derive a lifelong satisfaction from delving into it more deeply. It’s like Wordle for serious readers.”Mulhall has taken Ulysses as his travelling companion around the world, using it for creative diplomacy. He has blogged all 18 episodes on the embassy website, and he marked the 100th birthday with a new book called Ulysses: A Reader’s Odyssey.The epic is often compared to Seinfeld, because not all that much happens. It certainly doesn’t have the action of The Odyssey, upon which it is patterned. But it does boast, as Merve Emre wrote in the New Yorker, “a cultural literacy presented as godlike in its extent”.Colm Tóibín, the renowned Irish writer who teaches my class, wrote in rhe Financial Times about the book: “For the ordinary reader, it has the same cachet as running a marathon does for the ordinary athlete,” he said. “It is a challenge and then, for those who have read the book, a matter of pride.”“Ulysses,’” he added, “in all its generosity of style, its plenitude, the open sensuality of its characters, its lack of piety and respect for authority, its placing of a freethinking cosmopolitan Jewish man at its centre, can be read as a contribution to the Irish argument, the tone of the book as a blueprint for what Irish life might be like after independence.”Era of gobbledygookSmall moments, Tóibín said, “glitter and shimmer” because of Joyce’s wild flights of language. I bought a copy in Dublin long ago. But I had never mustered the will to read the story of love, desire and disconnectedness played out on Dublin strolls on a single day, June 16th, 1904 – the entwined stream-of-consciousness sagas of Stephen Dedalus and Molly and Leopold Bloom – until now.You’d think I would be accustomed to deciphering the incomprehensible after the past five years in DC. Donald Trump’s upside-down utterances. Kevin McCarthy’s demented backtracking. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s inanity, accusing Nancy Pelosi of siccing her “gazpacho police” on lawmakers. This era of gobbledygook has also featured the Republican National Committee issuing a resolution that the barbaric attack on the Capitol was “legitimate political discourse”. This was so outrageous that Mitt Romney had to brush back the chair of the RNC, his niece Ronna Romney McDaniel. Aside from Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, most everything the Republicans do is cowardly they are so afraid of the Trumpsters supporting the vandals that they tried to legitimise illegitimate discourse by calling it legitimate discourse. Shameful.And there’s the government’s indecipherable instructions on Covid-19 – crystallised in the ill-advised picture of Stacey Abrams trying to have it both ways, sitting and smiling, without a mask, in front of masked schoolchildren. The only thing that can save President Joe Biden and the Democrats now is Republicans showing how fringy and far out they’ve got. You know when Mitch McConnell is the guy calling out his own party that many top Republicans are freaking out. McConnell needs to get candidates to win in states that Biden won, like New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. That will be hard, given that we’re watching a party go nuts in real time. Their quarrons dainty are not. The latest Trump embarrassment came when Axios reported that the New York Times’s Maggie Haberman writes in her new book, Confidence Man, that White House residence staff members believed that Trump had wadded up papers found in a toilet. So the former president has a bathroom fixation. (HG Wells said Joyce, who could be graphic about bodily functions, had “a cloacal obsession”.)Nixon had the plumbers. Trump’s the one who needed them.

However it didn’t stop the spirit of New Orleans, which is gearing up for the high points of its traditional Mardi Gras carnival after a year which has seen it hit by both Covid and a hurricane.Mardi Gras itself, which takes place on Shrove Tuesday – the day before the start of Lent – is not until the beginning of March. However, the carnival season begins on January 6th, so it runs for longer this year as Easter is late.Already work crews are erecting seating platforms across the city for the hundreds of thousands of people, locals and tourists alike who will flock to New Orleans in the coming weeks.The Mardi Gras festivities still face some problems. A shortage of volunteer police officers has affected the plans and is likely to lead to some parades being altered or shortened. Mardi Gras in February 2020 was considered in some quarters to have acted as a Covid-19 “super-spreader event”in the region, and city authorities in New Orleans remain conscious of the dangers. Vaccination certificates are policed strictly at the entrances to most restaurants and bars as a condition of entry. Mardi Gras last year was cancelled due to Covid. And as one local said while waiting for the start of a parade last weekend, “the spirit of the city is just waiting to explode”. Gulf coastThe Mardi Gras festivities have been going on in New Orleans since the 1850s. The original organisers came from Alabama, where similar events could be dated back to about 1700, when, it is claimed, a French Canadian explorer threw a party after landing on the gulf coast.Initially in New Orleans the social organisations or clubs – known as “krewes”– which hosted the parades tended to be the preserves of the elites in the city.Later on the excluded groups – whether they be Irish, Italian, German, African American or women – started their own similar organisations.Elaborate masks – as well as costumes – have been associated with Mardi Gras since long before they became obligatory with the arrival of Covid. In New Orleans a significant portion of the year would seem to be spent by organisers planning the host of parties and parades to run from just after Christmas to Lent, as well as working on an extraordinary array of floats and outfits.One member of the krewe of Endymion, who spoke to The , said its parade would involve about 3,000 people. And it won’t be without celebrity endorsement.The post-parade “Endymion Extravaganza” in the Caesars Superdome in the city will feature American pop icon Diana Ross and the band Maroon 5.Last weekend it was the turn of the 900-member Intergalactic Krewe of Chewbacchus to take to the streets with their distinctively science fiction and particularly Star Wars-related parade.It was what is known as a walking parade featuring about 100 contraptions and devices which were variously pushed, pulled or pedalled rather than involving motorised floats. Some were elaborate and sophisticated. Others less so. Overall there was a light hearted, tongue-in-cheek element to the proceedings.There were legions of imperial star-troopers and assorted impromptu light sabre duels on the streets.And every hair stylist in Louisiana must have been booked out all day as dozens of lookalike Princess Leias with the trademark double-side buns – a la Carrie Fisher from the original 1977 Star Wars movie – paraded through the French district. Hurricane KatrinaThose who have not been back to New Orleans in several years – particularly since Hurricane Katrina 16 years ago which saw 80 per cent of the city flooded – will notice many changes.There are more tall buildings and, it may be the onset of age, but Bourbon Street sounds and seems louder than before. However, the traditional live jazz clubs can still be found on Frenchman’s Street.Mardi Gras in New Orleans remains one of the great interactive experiences. The parades are not just viewed as a spectacle. Many in the crowds dress in the traditional green, purple and gold costumes, wear face masks and hats and compete for the beads thrown from passing floats.Covid may have changed the world. And New Orleans is still recovering from a hurricane that hit only last August, 16 years to the day after Katrina. Workmen could still be seen fixing some house roofs last weekend. But the focus of the city is on partying.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"new trans laws scotland could open loophole rest uk","story":"A controversial relaxation of trans laws in Scotland may be unconstitutional because it will allow other UK citizens to self-declare their own gender by crossing the border, campaigners have warned.Fair Play for Women said the SNP plans would open up a clear loophole which would allow people from England, Wales and Northern Ireland to obtain a legal change in gender under the Scottish system before demanding a new birth certificate in their home countries.Nicola Williams, the group\u0027s director, said that in a recent meeting with Shona Robison, the SNP minister tasked with pushing the plans through Holyrood, officials gave incorrect information when attempting to dismiss her concerns.She accused SNP ministers of “acting well beyond their devolved powers”, adding: Alarm bells should be ringing at Westminster.Under current plans, only people born, adopted or “ordinarily resident” in Scotland would be able to apply for a gender recognition certificate under the relaxed Scottish rules.However, critics claim there are several ways in which the system could be exploited as there has been no detail on how a resident will be defined. For example, a person on an extended holiday or studying in Scotland could potentially be eligible.In an account that was not denied by the Scottish Government, Ms Williams claimed Ms Robison’s officials dismissed her fears by saying people from the UK had not travelled to Ireland to change gender once it relaxed its rules.The official claimed a gender recognition certificate in Ireland is automatically recognised in the UK, Ms Williams said, although this is not correct.It is now clear that the Scottish Government doesn\u0027t understand, or perhaps doesn\u0027t care, that Scottish reforms open the back door to self-ID for the whole of the UK, Ms Williams said.It\u0027s nonsense to think people in England and Wales won\u0027t use this loophole, returning home with new birth certificates and new rights.The Scottish Government is forcing through a bad law with UK-wide consequences, that should concern us all.Documents released under freedom of information laws show that the Scottish Government has discussed cross-border issues with trans activists but further details have not been provided.The SNP is determined to drop the requirement for someone to obtain a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria to obtain a gender recognition certificate.The period in which someone must live in their acquired gender would be cut from two years to three months and the process would also be opened up to 16 and 17-year-olds.Critics believe that the changes would effectively redefine the meaning of sex and lead to women\u0027s rights being diminished in areas such as the workplace and in sports.There are also fears removing safeguards would open the system up to abuse by allowing male sexual predators, who would simply claim to identify as a woman, access to women’s spaces such as refuges or changing rooms.Those in favour of reform believe the current process is expensive and humiliating for trans people and contributes to high levels of mental health problems in the community.Legislation for a new Scottish system is likely to be published within weeks. It was claimed on Sunday that the proposals, which are unpopular with the public and some MSPs, could be watered down still.The age limit for obtaining a certificate may be maintained at 18 while the length of time someone must live in their acquired gender set at six months, rather than three, The Sunday Times reported.However, any moves to water down the changes would be vigorously opposed by trans rights activists and the SNP’s Green Party coalition partners. Changing time and age limits would also be unlikely to satisfy feminists opponents, whose main objection is the self-declaration model.A Scottish Government spokesman said: “We have received correspondence from Fair Play For Women.

The scale of things that we\u0027re finding is reflective of that complicated story.The discovery of the First World War training round tallies with the Tower of London being a focal point of combat from 1914 to 1918.Soldiers were garrisoned there awaiting deployment at the start of the war and trained to use guns, while weapons were kept in storehouses within the tower.The tower was also used to contain people who posed a serious threat to national security, with 11 spies executed there.The French jetton, inscribed with the fleur-de-lis, is thought to have been made in Paris.While it is not uncommon to find English jettons, French ones are particularly rare. The find demonstrates how the Tower of London was a focal point of international travel.During the Tudor age, the tower was the most important state prison in the country and gained a reputation for being inescapable. The buckle found by excavators may have belonged to one of the guards.In 1977, at the Silver Jubilee, the moat was used for a garden display. In 2014, to mark the centenary of the start of the First World War, it was filled with 800,000 ceramic poppies in a moving commemoration.Visitors will be welcomed to the moat between June and September this year to see the Superbloom. Historic Royal Palaces plans to host smaller floral Jubilee displays across its other sites, including at Hampton Court Palace, Kensington Palace and Hillsborough Castle.Tom O’Leary, public engagement director at Historic Royal Palaces, said: We hope that this thriving new landscape, surrounding London’s formidable fortress, will celebrate the power of nature to unite us all.More from NewsOnly one in 1,000 scam and fraud victims receive justiceBoris Johnson urges Russia to ‘step back from the brink’ as war with Ukraine loomsFaceless yogi living in Himalayas ‘controlled’ Indian stock exchange for yearsWater companies are \u0026#39releasing raw sewage into rivers more than 1,000 times a day\u0026#39Parents told pupils could be considered \u0026#39transphobic\u0026#39 if confused by gender fluidityStop playing politics and find the best person to lead Met Police, Sadiq Khan toldMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"should replace cressida dick wrong question","story":"There will be few people shedding any tears at the resignation of Dame Cressida Dick as Commissioner of the politan Police. She has overseen a litany of failures broad enough to alienate the entire political spectrum, and her departure offers a long-overdue opportunity for an overhaul of this country’s largest police force.But the manner of her departure is not without its problems, and they can be summed up with this question: why does the Mayor of London have the power to sack the head of the UK’s counter-terrorism command?No wonder that the news has sparked a bitter row between Sadiq Khan and Priti Patel, with the Home Office claiming that the first they heard of Dick’s departure is when she called to tell them she was going.Not the level of strategic coordination we might hope for from the department in charge of law and order – especially because the Commissioner is actually appointed by the Home Secretary, not the Mayor.Yet it is now established that the Commissioner can’t continue to serve if they lose the confidence of City Hall. Boris Johnson will know this better than most as Mayor of London he engineered the resignation of Sir Ian Blair (the  described this as a “Tory coup”).At first glance, this might be easy to dismiss as merely a turf war between politicians. But the result is blurred lines of accountability. Formally, Londoners have no way of subjecting the leadership of their local police to democratic oversight. Practically, the Mayor can sack someone with UK-wide responsibilities, appointed by a government with a national mandate.What this means is that the question in all the newspapers this week, ‘Who should replace Cressida Dick?’, is the wrong question. We need to do better than just finding someone to do a better job in a fundamentally flawed position. Rather, the Government should seize this opportunity to undertake a root-and-branch reform of the politan Police, with a view to ending the current hybrid arrangements altogether.In its place we should have a normal constabulary for London, on the same basis as those elsewhere in England and Wales, with clear and formal accountability to the Mayor or the London Assembly, alongside one or more national organisations which answer to the Home Office.Obvious candidates for the latter include counter-terrorism, close protection, and aviation policing. But Patel should also look at whether or not the Territorial Support Group, this country’s primary public order unit, would work better as the nucleus of a new stand-alone operation.After all, one of the explanations often given for why the police are slow to get up to speed policing riots effectively is an alleged tension between community policing, which rests in large part on building positive relationships with the policed, and the more confrontational public order role. Formal ision of those responsibilities is the norm in many other countries, including our near-neighbours in Europe, and is worth exploring as part of a broader consultation on far-reaching reform.This brings us back to our question above. If the politan Police is reformed as a purely local police force, then the next commissioner can be selected from a pool of candidates geared towards those responsibilities.They will then be able to focus 100 per cent of their attention on delivering better policing for Londoners, and will have to answer to their elected representatives should they fail to do so. Meanwhile the Government can go about finding people best-suited to discharge the nationalfunctions separately.Given how very different the roles are, it would be no surprise if they ended up being filled by quite different candidates – indeed, it would be more surprising if they were not!But under our current system, the best-case scenario is that one of those people gets the job, and spends part of their time doing each bit as well as they can. Just as likely, someone who isn’t best-suited to either gets the job in an attempt to split the difference.Of course, the Met can’t simply go leaderless whilst this process is carried out. But Patel should make it clear that the upcoming appointment is a provisional one. If not, a vital shot at urgently needed reform will have been wasted.More from NewsOnly one in 1,000 scam and fraud victims receive justiceBoris Johnson urges Russia to ‘step back from the brink’ as war with Ukraine loomsFaceless yogi living in Himalayas ‘controlled’ Indian stock exchange for yearsWater companies are \u0026#39releasing raw sewage into rivers more than 1,000 times a day\u0026#39Parents told pupils could be considered \u0026#39transphobic\u0026#39 if confused by gender fluidityStop playing politics and find the best person to lead Met Police, Sadiq Khan toldMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden right covid along","story":"To understand Sweden, you need to understand a word that’s hard to explain, let alone translate: lagom. It means, in effect, “perfect-simple”: not too much, not too little. People who are lagom don’t stand out or make a fuss: they blend right in – and this is seen as a virtue. Essays are written about why lagom sums up a certain Swedish mindset – that it’s bad to stand out, to consider yourself better or be an outlier. That’s why it’s so strange that, during the lockdowns, Sweden became the world’s defiant outlier.Swedes saw it the other way around. They were keeping calm and carrying on: lockdown was an extreme, draconian, untested experiment. Lock up everyone, keep children out of school, suspend civil liberties, send police after people walking their dogs – and call this “caution”? Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist, never spoke about a Swedish “experiment”. He said all along he could not recommend a public health intervention that had never been proven.Tegnell also made another point: that he didn’t claim to be right. It would take years, he’d argue, to see who had jumped the right way. His calculation was that, on a whole-society basis, the collateral damage of lockdowns would outweigh what good they do. But you’d only know if this was so after a few years. You’d have to look at cancer diagnosis, hospital waiting lists, educational damage and, yes, count the Covid dead. Almost two years on, we can look at the early indications.The problem with lockdowns is that no one looks at whole-society pictures. Professor Neil Ferguson’s team from Imperial College London admitted this, once, as a breezy aside. “We do not consider the wider social and economic costs of suppression,” they wrote in a supposed assessment of lockdown, “which will be high.” But just how high? And were they a price worth paying?As Sweden abolishes all domestic Covid restrictions, it emerges with one of Europe’s lower Covid death tolls: the rate is 1,614 per million people, just over half the amount of Britain (2,335). Given that our death tolls were comparable at first (both among the worst anywhere), it’s hard to argue that there’s some demographic force which meant Covid was never going to spread in Sweden. Nor is it possible to argue that Sweden was some hedonistic party-nation: its people were incredibly cautious. But unlike Brits, they had a government that trusted them.There were some Swedish diktats: a “rule of eight” was set up for a while. Bars, restaurants and cafes were all socially distanced and, at one point, had to close by 8.30pm. For a few weeks, Swedes even had vaccine passports. But that was about it: the rest was guidance, and it was followed.What no statistic can convey is just how careful Swedes were something that struck me whenever I’d visit. It was perfectly legal to meet up in bars and for a fika in a coffee shop, but most didn’t. A friend of mine had a rule that she’d only ever meet friends outside – even in the Stockholm winter (she did this so much that she got frostbite). In summer last year, studies showed Swedes working from home more than in any other European country.This kept Covid low, while the lack of rules allowed for people to use their judgement while minimising economic and social damage. Sweden’s GDP fell by 2.9 per cent in 2020, while Britain’s collapsed by 9.4 per cent. Both have bounded back, but Sweden’s economy is this year expected to be five per cent larger than before the pandemic, versus two per cent for Germany. The UK will be about one per cent, one of the lowest figures in Europe. The cost of the various Covid measures is best summed up by the debt mountain: an extra £8,400 per head in Britain, and £3,000 in Sweden.Swedish schools kept going throughout, with no face masks. Sixth-formers and undergraduates switched to home learning, but the rest of Swedish children went to school as normal. That’s not to say there weren’t absences as the virus spread: it was common to see a third, at times even half of the class absent due to sniffles or suspected Covid. But there were no full-scale closures and, aside from some suspicions about minor grade inflation (the average maths grade sneaked up to 10.1, from 9.3), there is no talk in Sweden about educational devastation.In Britain, there is calamity and cover-up. By doling out more A grades than ever before – and telling universities to make more space – young people could be shovelled through the system with lost ground never recognised or quite made up.Grade inflation was staggering: the number of A-level students marked at A or A* jumped to 45 per cent, up from 26 per cent pre-pandemic, but no one doubts that these students learned far less. By some measures, educational inequality has been set back 10 years. But some problems are too big to admit.Academics suggest the effect of lost education is permanent: less education inevitably means lower salaries and slower career progression. The Institute for Fiscal Studies talks about £40,000 of lost lifetime earnings per pupil in Britain, £350 billion in all. Swedish studies estimate that Covid’s impact (on absenteeism and home-learning) could mean an £800 million overall hit – far smaller than the impact on Britain’s lost school days.The impact on hospital waiting lists is also very different. Fear of a virus keeps people away – at the peak of the first wave, attendance at Swedish A\u0026ampE was 31 per cent lower than normal in Britain, it collapsed by 57 per cent. Routine operations were down by 20 per cent in Sweden and 34 per cent in England, so waiting lists grew in both countries. As they did pretty much world over.But no country, anywhere, has had a waiting list grow as big as Britain’s: from 4.4 million pre-pandemic, it will keep getting worse for two years and peak at about 9.2 million, according to NHS modelling – that’s equivalent to one in five adults. A top-down health service is more easily disrupted if it’s ordered to transform into a Covid service (and people are told to “protect the NHS” by not using it). Sweden’s waiting lists, 130,000 pre-pandemic, hit 170,000 last October. Even adjusting for population, it’s nowhere near the size of Britain’s problem.Sweden will not declare victory. No one was properly prepared for Covid, and The country’s failure to protect care home residents is still seen as a national scandal. Sweden also took a bigger hit than its neighbours: Denmark, which did lock down, has more to shout about when it comes to combining a lower Covid hit with minimal economic disruption. But, as Tegnell would say, it’s still too early to say – with any finality – who got it right and who didn’t.More from NewsOnly one in 1,000 scam and fraud victims receive justiceBoris Johnson urges Russia to ‘step back from the brink’ as war with Ukraine loomsFaceless yogi living in Himalayas ‘controlled’ Indian stock exchange for yearsWater companies are \u0026#39releasing raw sewage into rivers more than 1,000 times a day\u0026#39Parents told pupils could be considered \u0026#39transphobic\u0026#39 if confused by gender fluidityStop playing politics and find the best person to lead Met Police, Sadiq Khan toldMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vet performed needless hip replacements dogs source financial","story":"A pioneering vet has been struck off after performing unnecessary hip replacements on dogs.Dr Marthinus Ryk Botes, an animal orthopaedics specialist at Meet in Kent, carried out total hip replacements on three canines in 2016 and 2017 and recommended the procedure for a fourth when it was not in their best interests. He did so without consulting their owners about alternative treatments.A disciplinary panel held last month said the operations were a source of financial gain and decided that Dr Botes\u0027 behaviour amounted to serious misconduct.He was found culpable of seven charges at a Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons tribunal and has now been banned from practising as a vet.He also failed to keep adequate clinical records in respect of all the dogs he treated.In its decision, the panel said: The committee took into account that the total hip replacements in question were a source of financial gain, that Dr Botes’ conduct was repeated over a considerable period of time and that he was in an increased position of trust and responsibility because of perceived expertise in small animal orthopaedics and its education.It said that suspension was not a severe enough sanction, as there was a real risk of repetition of Dr Botes\u0027 behaviour. The panel also said his failings were wide-ranging and covered the basic and fundamental requirements of any veterinary surgeon.The dogs which were given total hip replacements were Daisy, a Cocker Spaniel Kilo, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier and Sora, a West Highland Terrier Japanese Akita cross.Dr Botes recommended that Penny, a Bichon Frise cross, also have the operation.Dr Botes is known for his pioneering surgeries on small animals.In 2019, he was praised for his work to fix the crooked jaw of a Shih Tzu called Poppet.The dog had struggled to eat or clean itself because its tongue permanently hung out of its mouth. Dr Botes used a 3D printer to construct a new jaw made of titanium.However, he was suspended from practice for six months in 2008 due to his care of a dog involved in a traffic accident, which was found to amount to serious professional misconduct.More from NewsOnly one in 1,000 scam and fraud victims receive justiceBoris Johnson urges Russia to ‘step back from the brink’ as war with Ukraine loomsFaceless yogi living in Himalayas ‘controlled’ Indian stock exchange for yearsWater companies are \u0026#39releasing raw sewage into rivers more than 1,000 times a day\u0026#39Parents told pupils could be considered \u0026#39transphobic\u0026#39 if confused by gender fluidityStop playing politics and find the best person to lead Met Police, Sadiq Khan toldMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"water companies releasing raw sewage rivers 1000 times day","story":"Water companies are releasing raw sewage into rivers more than 1,000 times a day despite being told to do so only when there is heavy rainfall,  analysis reveals.More than a third of sewage discharge occurred when there was no heavy rain in the areas, according to the research, which suggests firms are breaching terms of their permits.The revelation comes as the  launches its Clean Rivers campaign, calling for action to stop water companies, industrial agriculture and urban waste from polluting England’s beauty spots.Raw sewage was discharged into rivers and coastal areas for more than 3.1 million hours on more than 400,000 occasions throughout 2020, according to data from the Environment Agency.These spills are intended to occur only during times of exceptional rainfall to help the sewage network cope.But analysis of 10,000 storm overflow monitors found a major discrepancy in the total hours of sewage spilled into rivers, and the total amount of rainfall throughout the year.In 2020, the  found at least 1,222 storm overflows which spilled sewage for longer than the amount of hours of heavy rain in the area.In total, at least 1.1 million hours of raw sewage were estimated to have discharged from these overflows when there was no heavy rain, suggesting water companies are using sewage outflows to an extent unjustified by bad weather.The data includes a site on the River Derwent in Duffield, where sewage was pumped into the river for 8,000 hours in 2020, according to the data, but which had just 456 hours of heavy rainfall in the immediate area.The Environment Agency (EA) launched a major investigation in 2021 into more than 2,000 treatment works after water companies admitted they could be releasing sewage into rivers at levels in breach of their permits.Separately, the EA has identified 1,300 “frequently spilling” overflows that it is investigating for potentially breaching their permits.Spills from an overflow outside of rainfall - so-called dry spills often caused by blockages in the network - are more likely to damage the environment as the sewage is not diluted by rainwater.The analysis suggests that overflows managed by Thames Water saw the highest amount of dry spilling on average, with each discharging sewage outside of rainfall for 255 hours or 10 days in 2020.More than a quarter of Thames Water’s 400 overflows saw at least some dry spilling in 2020.Storm overflows managed by Severn Trent Water and United Utilities each saw on average six days’ worth of dry spilling in 2020, placing them as the second and third worst offenders respectively.Northumbrian Water’s overflows performed best of all companies for dry spilling, yet each still saw more than a day\u0027s worth of dry spilling in 2020.The use of storm overflows is regulated by the EA, which relies on event duration monitoring (EDM) devices installed across the sewage network that detect how often and for how long sewage is being released from inidual overflows.Rollout of the devices began in earnest in 2016 yet coverage is still spotty across the network, with Anglian Water still yet to install EDM monitors at more than half of its sites by 2020.River campaigners and water companies say that EDM data fails to capture the whole picture of the chemical and sewage pollution in our rivers.Water companies do not publicly release data about the volume or quality of the water that comes out during the hours of spilling. But they argue that spillages can often come from groundwater which may not be harmful to the environment.Christine Colvin, a hydrogeologist and spokesman for the Rivers Trust, said the  analysis was a valid “first filter” given the lack of data provided.“Where you are seeing excessive duration of overspill, that\u0027s an alarm bell,” she said. “Then if we can start getting the quality data and start looking at where the poorest quality long-duration overspills are, that will help us to prioritise which ones need to stop first.“The scale of overflows is symptomatic of a system that is no longer fit for purpose, and one that has been inadequately regulated for too long,” she added. “Its abuse and misuse is causing wide-scale pollution, our rivers are suffering death by a thousand budget cuts.”Philip Dunne MP, the chairman of the environmental audit committee, who has called for greater regulation of water companies to stop widespread river pollution, said: “Illegal spills of sewage, breaching Environment Agency permits, must stop. They pose a danger to public health and to the wildlife in our river habitats. Dry spilling is completely unacceptable.“For too long water companies, regulators and the Government have turned a blind eye to discharging sewage when our creaking sewerage infrastructure cannot cope. This must get sorted.”A spokesman for Water UK, the industry body, said: “Water companies agree there is an urgent need for action to tackle the harm caused to the environment by overflows. To achieve change, we need to combine new investment with action on wet wipes and urban creep that are increasingly triggering spills.“We’re also calling for Government, regulators, water companies, agriculture and other sectors to come together to create a comprehensive national plan to bring about the transformation in our rivers that we all want to see.”Thames Water said it did not agree with all aspects of the ’s methodology, and added: “We regard all discharges of untreated sewage as unacceptable and will work with the Government, Ofwat and the Environment Agency to accelerate work to stop them being necessary, and are determined to be transparent.”United Utilities said: “We support the call for action to improve the health of our rivers and we stand ready to invest further to help achieve the transformation we all want to see. Monitoring storm overflows in a consistent way across the industry will help better determine areas for future improvement.”Severn Trent said it disagreed with the “high-level” analysis, which it said fails to factor in “inidual characteristics of local catchments”. But it added that it was “committed to ensuring that our work will cause no harm to our rivers by 2030”.The EA said: “Where there is evidence of non-compliance we will not hesitate to pursue the water companies concerned and take appropriate action.”By Feargal Sharkey, the former lead singer of the Undertones and chairman of the Amwell Magna Fishery, the oldest fly-fishing club in EnglandIt’s the retirement home we could all dream about. An Elizabethan house nestling quietly in the rolling hills of Hertfordshire surrounded by some of the most beautiful countryside in England and home to some of the rarest river systems on the planet, chalk streams.There is even a chalk stream at the bottom of the garden, it’s one of just 225 in the entire world. This one, however, carries a very dark secret. In the past 12 months alone the local water company has dumped sewage into it on more than 30 separate occasions. What should be home to thousands of wild brown trout, egrets, white-clawed crayfish and shrimp has been replaced by a grey, foul-smelling sludge destroying all that lays before it, replacing life with death, light with darkness.In 2020, the nearby sewage works in Hitchin spent 4,981 hours, the equivalent of 207 whole days, dumping sewage into the River Hiz, another chalk stream. And you won’t find it getting any better anywhere else in the country either, for nothing escapes this ecocide. As a result not a single river in England is currently listed as being in good overall environmental health, every one of them is polluted, and one of the largest sources of that pollution is the water industry.What we are witnessing in our own backyard is not some unhappy accident following a global catastrophe. No, this is a much simpler, neater, home-grown disaster. Decades of regulatory failure mixed with colossal underinvestment by the water industry, topped off with years of political buck passing, has created a situation where water companies have been allowed to pay out £72 billion to their shareholders. In the past five years alone, the CEOs of the nine water companies have been paid a staggering £65 million between them, one even earning £2.8 million in 2020 alone.In return we have been given chalk streams that have been robbed of that most basic necessity of life water and nationally our rivers are being slowly poisoned, degraded and destroyed by monotonously regular helpings of sewage.Yet no matter how grim this forecast might seem it is not and never is too late.

Writing in the Sunday , Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay said both financially and in taking a step back from people’s lives ministers would be taking a new approach to government.It comes just days after Communities Secretary Michael Gove gave a speech in Liverpool vowing to hand more power to northern leaders and making levelling up the central mission of our times.“Now, it is a priority to restore a smaller state – both financially and in taking a step back from people’s lives. It’s time toto a more enabling approach. To trust the people,power to communities, and free up business to deliver, Mr Barclay wrote.Concern is growing that the Prime Ministeraposs flagship levelling up agenda will now take a back seat and several reports have also suggested Chancellor Rishi Sunak is blocking cash for projects in the North and Midlands as he tightens the purse-strings post-Covid.Alex Norris MP, Labouraposs Shadow Levelling Up Minster, said: Our communities are clear they want more ambition and a long term plan for their areas, but the Tories canapost even agree the basics.  At the start of the week Michael Gove told northern leaders state intervention will be needed to level up the country. At the end of the week the Prime Ministeraposs new Chief of Staff is telling Tory backbenchers the priority is less from the state. This government are incapable of agreeing on anything and people are paying the price.” Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is under sustained pressure over the Partygate scandal, with Downing Street confirming he has been sent a legal questionnaire by Met Police cop investigating rule-busting gatherings at No. He will leave Westminster this week insisting he is “getting on with the job” while touting his staffing changes in No as helping to focus on his “levelling up” policy as he fights to stay in office.Downing Street said he is to start the week with a visit to a manufacturing site in Scotland before heading to an oncology centre tackling coronavirus backlogs in the north west of England.In a statement, Mr Johnson said: “I’m getting out of London this week and taking a simple message with me – this Government is getting on with the job of uniting and levelling up the country.”Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis was also bullish during the Sunday morning broadcast round, saying the Prime Minister will “fight” and win the next election despite the parties scandal. He told Sky’s Trevor Phillips On Sunday: “He has my absolute %-plus loyalty. I think this a Prime Minister is doing things for our country, he’s got the big decisions right. I think he will fight and he will win as a result of the next general election.” But travelling north of the border will present its own challenges for the PM, with his ally Jacob Rees-Mogg having accused Douglas Ross of being “lightweight” after the Scottish Tory leader called for Mr Johnson’s resignation.Mr Johnson has called in a lawyer to help, as he calls from Tory backbenchers for him to go will only grow louder and more widespreadhe cannot convince police he was not in breach of regulations at up to six events. It has been reported that evenhe is fined he will not resign - something that would be likely to trigger Tory MPs to force a vote of confidence in his leadership. Scotland Yard says the questionnaires, which have legal force, ask for an “account and explanation of the recipient’s participation in an event” and have “formal legal status and must be answered truthfully”. Fteen Tory MPs have publicly called for Mr Johnson to quit, while more are thought to have privately written to the  Committee of backbench Tories calling for a no-confidence vote. More are poised to do sothe Prime Minister is found to have broken his own coronavirus laws, or further damaging details emerge from the Sue Gray inquiry. He will face a vote of no confidence Conservative MPs write to  Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady, and would be oustedmore than half of his MPs subsequently voted against him.

Everything I’ve read recently in @yorkshirepost makes me fear I’m going to find it transformed into a county of leftist whingers begging for handouts. Let’s hope that’s not the case.  The remarks prompted an immediate backlash, with people calling the post insulting and abhorrent Editor of the Yorkshire Post James Mitchinson accused the politician of sneering.

Labour Mayor for West Yorkshire Tracy Brabin added: Yorkshire is a great place for a holiday and I’ve no doubt Lord Moylan will enjoy his stay.

The Governmentaposs levelling up plans have come in for widespread criticism in the North of England when it was published earlier this month.

After years of promising a slimmed-down monarchy when he finally takes the reins, a streamlined coronation is the only way for Prince Charles to prove he means business.In the modern world, the senior royals are acutely aware of the need to prove they are value for money and the weight of this responsibility has weighed heavily on the Prince of Wales. A shorter, cheaper and less ostentatious ceremony at Westminster Abbey, albeit with the rather flamboyant codename Operation Golden Orb, will be welcomed by a public more concerned with the ever-increasing costs of living rather than what insignia will be used on postboxes. Charles might often seem like a man from a bygone era, who may at face value appear less in tune with the modern world than his son William and daughter in law Kate, but those close to him will tell you he cares deeply about the effect he can have on the world around him. As the UK was struggling with record levels of unemployment and spiralling inflation in the s, Prince Charles used his Navy severance pay – £, – to fund a number of community initiatives.  The Prince’s Trust charity has gone on to transform tens of thousands of young people’s lives who would have otherwise been afforded little chance of success. His -year crusade campaigning on the environment, which was so often ridiculed and derided, has also been proved revolutionary in its inception at a time when the type of conversations so commonplace today simply weren’t happening at all.  And another subtle sign that Charles will be doing things a little dferently will be displayed on his coronation day when as the new Supreme Governor of the Church of England, he will declare how he wants to be aposdefender of faithapos not aposthe faithapos. Charles’s time in the top job may end up being a footnote in history compared to the epic record-breaking reign of his mother, but his legacy will undoubtedly reverberate for decades to come.

Grandparents Vera and Barry Singh had climbed to the top of St Maryaposs Lighthouse to photograph the stunning scenery on February . But when the couple, from Whickham, County Durham, came back down at around pm they were shocked to find that staff had closed up and left, locking them inside.Barry, , told Chronicle Live : When we came down everything was closed up and we were left in the lighthouse.My we was really panicking and saying, aposhow are we going to get out aposEventually, I found a fire exit and opened it and ran out to the front, but when we looked at the causeway the water was starting to come in quite high. Thankfully, I had left the fire exit door open and we were able to get back inside and get warm. We managed to put some lights on and found a heater, but the alarms were going off so my we suggested we ring the police to say that we had been left in the lighthouse. The couple, who run their own shop BV Stores, said police told them they could send a helicopter. But the pair did not want to use a vital service and decided to wait for the tide to go down. At pm, after six hours of being stuck at the lighthouse, the pair were helped to safety by Tynemouth Volunteer Le Brigade. Vera, , said she had called a number she found online for the lighthouse three times at around .pm without any answer before deciding to call police. Itaposs still unbelievable what happened, she said.  We still canapost believe it. We are safe and well but it could have been a dferent storywe hadnapost been able to get back inside. It could have been a very panicky situation for children, anybody elderly, or anybody who has panic attacks. When I went outside it was dark, all I could hear was the wind and the water was right up. The honest pair even left a note and money at the lighthouse to pay for the snacks and hot drinks they had while they were stuck inside. Vera said she has informed North Tyneside Council about the incident and recommended that a phone be installed inside and outside of the building in case of emergencies. We want to thank the police and Coastguard for their help and getting us safely back to shore, she added. Thanks also to the police for calling and checking up on us which helped us to stay calm. Northumbria Police confirmed they received a call from the couple and said they gave suitable advice to them and also contacted the Coastguard on their behalf.A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman said: We logged this incident shortly before pm on Sunday, February . Following that, we sent Tynemouth Volunteer Le Brigade to a report of two people cut off by the tide at St Maryaposs Lighthouse. The team assisted in walking the two people safely across the causeway, once the tide had gone out at around pm.  North Tyneside Council confirmed that it would be carrying out an investigation into the incident and said it was the first time anything like this had happened at St Maryaposs Lighthouse in its  years as a visitor attraction. A council spokesperson said: “The volunteer le brigade alerted us to a couple who were stranded on the island. We have since spoken with the couple to offer our apologies for any distress this may have caused. We will investigate and we will take their recommendations onboard. “St Mary’s Lighthouse is a hugely popular visitor attraction which draws , visitors each year and we have never had an incident like this before in the  years since the lighthouse was decommissioned and became a visitor centre.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Northumbria PolicePanic attacksEmergencyRescue\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The future King is expected to make sure his coronation is more representative of dferent community groups and faiths. What do you make of Prince Charlesapos coronation plans  Have your say in the comment section  This is part of his vision of a modern aposslimmed-downapos monarchy, a royal source told the Mail on Sunday. The Queenaposs ceremony on June   was influenced by Britainaposs global empire at the time. Although the empire was in decline, the UK still had more than  overseas territories when the Queen was crowned. It was only in  that Prince Charles himself declared the aposend of the Empireapos when Hong Kong was transferred to China.  Many of Britainaposs former territories are now part of the Commonwealth, which the future King will lead when he ascends the throne. Some , troops from the Commonwealth and  from the aposcoloniesapos took part in the Queenaposs coronation parade, which involved a total of more than , armed forces personnel.  More than , dignitaries, including representatives from British protectorates overseas, were taken to Westminster Abbey in the procession. The Queen had to change her outfit several times during the ceremony, which was viewed by an estimated  million people across the world and lasted more than three hours.  Charlesapos service will be a more scaled back affair, with a maximum of , guests, the Mail on Sunday reports. A source told the newspaper: It will be a slimmed-down Monarchy on display throughout. I wouldnapost be surprised to see just Charles and Camilla, Kate and William and their children on the Buckingham Palace balcony afterwards. An insider said there are aposbinders and bindersapos of paperwork on the accession and coronation, although Clarence House denied any detailed plans had been drawn up.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The Coronation service was rewritten in recent years to modernise the language and shorten the event. Although it will be an Anglican service, there will be a place for other religions and Christian denominations. Charles previously showed his embrace of other religions in Britain by saying he would like to be known as aposDefender of Faithapos - instead of aposDefender of the Faithapos. He also plans to switch the official insignia that appears on postboxes and police officersapos unorms from St Edwardaposs crown to the Tudor Crown.The costs of the ceremony will be met by the taxpayer and Charles is said to be keen that it should be aposgood valueapos.

In the past she has criticised the supermarket chain after items including peanut butter, had been removed from the cheaper line. Her research showed budget prices across the big four supermarket had seen a sharp increase over recent years. But Jack then found products from the chainaposs Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges at their local store, saying it had made it the “happiest shopping experience in over a decade”. After seeing Jackaposs earlier Tweets, Asda said it would stock its Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges in all  food stores and online by March  to help its customers with the cost-of-living crisis.  All branches will have the full range of  Smart Price and Farm Stores lines, the company said. It confirmed on Saturday that the full range is already available online. Jack shared photos of products at Asda in Shoeburyness, Essex, that have reverted to their price from a year ago. In one tweet, Jack showed a kilogramme bag of rice that was back to its old price of p, after jumping last month to £ for g – a price increase of %.  The food campaigner was poised to give the store a hard time for excluding an entire group of customers. But she changed her mind and was left in tears by what she saw on the supermarket shelves which moved her in a way she did not expect. Jack wrote: “I was very quick to vily Asda for what I saw as a change of direction for their company, and a watering down of their commitment to an entire group of their customers.”  The company promised to “do better”, she said, as she praised the “remarkable” speed of the turnaround. “The impact that this will have on millions of people, is impossible to overstate,” Jack said, adding that she “cried, quietly, to myself, in Asda” at the development. She also wrote: “So I guess I just wanted to say thanks to everyone at Asda who has worked really hard over the last few weeks to bring the missing SmartPrice products back.”  Meg Farren, Asda’s chief customer officer, said: “We want to help our customers’ budgets stretch further and have taken on board the comments about the availability of our Smart Price range made by Jack Monroe. “We are taking steps to put our full Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges in store and online to make these products as accessible as possible.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AsdaSupermarkets\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The book, by Jill Tomlinson, tells the story of baby barn owl Plop, who is helped by others to grow in confidence and overcome his fears. The Duchess chose the book to mark Children’s Mental Health Week.The mother of three looked snug as she sat in a wooded area with a hot chocolate within reach, two soft toy owls for company and a lit fire bowl.At the end of the reading, she added: “Wow, what an encouraging tale.  “We can all feel scared sometimes just like our little owl friend Plop, but as Mrs Barn Own said, ‘It’s better to find out about the things that scare us before we make up our mind’. “And with the help of others, we can often face things that worry us. Now it’s time for bed. Night night and sleep tight.”The duchess took part in the broadcast on the BBC ’s channel for young children to mark Children’s Mental Health Week, which is a national event that aims to highlight the importance of the issue.She picked Tomlinson’s book as the story chimes with this year’s theme of Growing Together.  An aide earlier revealed she loved the book as a child and enjoys reading it now to her children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.Other celebrities to appear on CBeebies Bedtime Stories include the likes of Hollywood star Chris Evans, Ed Sheeran, Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl and British actors Tom Hiddleston and Tom Hardy.She followed in the footsteps of her father-in-law Prince Charles, who appeared on Jackanory in  to read his tale, The Old Man of Lochnagar.  Patricia Hidalgo, director of BBC childrenaposs and education programmes, said before her appearance: “I couldnapost be more proud to have the duchess read a CBeebies bedtime story as we mark the th anniversary of our CBeebies and CBBC channels. “Itaposs such a special and relevant tale and perfectly represents this yearaposs Childrenaposs Mental Health Week theme.

He gave a statement admitting killing Lin and Megan Russell but now allegedly denies it.The source said the serial killer’s wind-up has caused “heartbreak and anguish”. Bellfield – whose murder victims include teenager Milly Dowler – had given a statement in which he admitted killing Lin, , daughter Megan, six, and attempting to kill her sister Josie, nine. But he has allegedly retracted it and now denies the  murders in Chillenden, Kent, sources say. He has reportedly bragged his four-page confession was a ploy to “mess” with Michael Stone, who is serving le for the murders but has always denied guilt. The source said: “Bellfield is a narcissist who loves the limelight – he’s now saying he just wanted to mess with Stone’s legal team. “He doesn’t appreciate the absolute heartbreak and anguish he heaps on the Russell family every time he publicly speaks about the crime.” Insiders say Bellfield is even claiming to have written a formal letter to Kent Police to distance himself from the crime.Bellfield, , gave a detailed admission to Stone’s solicitor Paul Bacon last month saying that he was behind the countryside killings. Stone, , hoped the unsigned document would prove he had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice. The Criminal Case Review Commission has been looking at the convictions – at Stone’s request. But the supposed U-turn by Bellfield – already serving le for the deaths of Milly, , Amelie Delagrange, , and -year-old Marsha McDonnell – means he may now refuse to help the CCRC.  Ex-Chief Supt Kevin Moore led a review into the hunt for Bellfield after he murdered Milly and fears he may now be hogging the limelight. Mr Moore, , said: “People like him aren’t normal. They love the limelight, the bravado. You have to askthis is an opportunity to be in the headlines. “Yes it’s right and proper that it’s looked into, but I would very much doubt the validity of his admission.”The former Sussex police chief was immediately sceptical about Bellfield’s claim to be the killer.He explained: “You have to look at the circumstances. Bellfield’s other murders featured a sole female victim. The modus operandi for the murders of Lin Russell and her daughter is a whole dferent ball game. The others involved the abduction of young women from the streets in busy areas, in cities, towns. “Chillenden was out in the country. Stone had knowledge of that area, I can’t see how Bellfield had knowledge of that area. I don’t know why Bellfield would confess now – he’s serving a whole le sentence so he’s not going to get a reduction in his sentence.” Bellfield’s supposed confession came in a four-page statement. He said he wore yellow marigold washing up gloves, had taken a hair scrunchie as a souvenir, killed the family dog after it bit him and had to call in Clacket Lane services on the M to wash off blood. The statement said: “My first intention was to just attack Lin... the situation just got out of control.” It went on to detail how he said he killed Lin and Megan and left Josie for dead with appalling injuries.  He said he ed home to Twickenham, South West London – the patch where he would carry out a triple murder spree – went to work as a bouncer and, next day, threw the murder weapon into the Thames. Bellfield, now known as Yusuf Rahim after converting to Islam, wrote: “Something like this has never happened, in the sense I’ve committed a crime and another person has been arrested. “I apologise to Stone and the Russell family for my heinous acts.” The document was sent to the CCRC, which has the power to order retrials. Stone always denied responsibility. He was found guilty in  but the convictions were later quashed before he was found guilty at a retrial in . The CCRC said: “We have received two unsigned documents from Mr Stone’s representatives.

The CCRC has carried out extensive investigations on information and materials supplied by Mr Stone’s representatives. Once the review is complete, the CCRC will determine whether there is a real possibility the Court of Appeal will quash Mr Stone’s conviction.” Det Chief Supt Paul Fotheringham, of Kent Police, said: “Following two trials at which Stone was found guilty by a jury, and an appeal to the High Court, Michael Stone remains convicted of the murders. “The CCRC has had access to all forensic evidence, documentation and exhibits, the review by Hampshire Police, details of the two trials and appeals to the High Court.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Hampshire PoliceKent PoliceLevi BellfieldMichael StoneMurderLe sentenceCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The new guidance would suggest families may like to consider the jab to protect against a ‘potential future wave’. The percentage of people testing positive for Covid decreased but remained “very high” for those aged  years to aged  in the week ending February th, . Officials figures show that . per cent of that age range were positive after a nose and throat test.Currently, , children in this age bracket, who are either most at risk of Covid- or live with someone vulnerable, are now able to get vaccinations against the virus.But in a hint at things to come health bosses at the British overseas territory the Cayman Islands have reportedly been told they will get vaccines for all their  to -year-olds shipped from the UK “in a few weeks”.Families have been complaining that their holiday plans have been thwarted because of the lack of jabs for under-s in the UK. The majority of countries in Europe are now introducing jabs for under-s, and some resorts have banned those who are unvaccinated apart. However, Spain announced that it would relax its rules from Monday, to allow unvaccinated British teenagers to enter the country with a negative test. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas been ided about the matter for months and last officially updated their advice just before Christmas. Then they changed their guidance to include children aged  to  who are ‘in a clinical risk group or who has household contact with someone who is immunosuppressed’.  They said the decision was made “following extensive assessment of the risks and benefits of vaccinations” for this age and after considering clinical trials and international data.They added: “Further advice regarding COVID- vaccination for other  to -year-olds will be issued in due course following consideration of additional data relevant to this age group, and on the Omicron iant more broadly.”Professor Wei Shen Lim, Chair, COVID- immunisation, JCVI, said at the time: “The majority of children aged  to  are at very low risk of serious illness due to COVID-. However, some  to -year-olds have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk, and we advise these children to be vaccinated in the first instance.” The committee is now understood to have recommended to ministers that jabs should be offered to all in that age group, but it is not clearformal advice has yet been given to Government health officials.  A statement from the Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said on Sunday: “No decisions have been made by ministers on whether healthy --year-olds should be routinely offered COVID- vaccines.”Currently, the NHS is offering COVID- vaccine to children and young people aged  to  years.Young people at greater risk of serious illnessthey catch COVID- will need  doses of vaccine,  weeks apart.

In September  he had warned Britain was at a “tipping point” as the country lurched towards a second lockdown. But yesterday it was only two pence pieces teetering on the edge of potential danger as Matt played with family.Another visitor to the arcade told North Wales Live the West Suffolk MP was left alone to play the slot machine. He added many people may simply have not recognised him. Last year the Tory angered the Welsh Government when during his former role he suggested Wales’ successful vaccination programme was only possible as England kept a stockpile.Giving evidence to the Science and Technology Committee about coronavirus, the MP said: “I would argue that the vaccination programme demonstrates that the union saves lives and in the case of Wales, the union has helped Wales to have one of the fastest vaccination programmes in the world and I wish them every luck in the delivery of it. The Welsh Government later angrily retorted: The success of our world-leading vaccine programme is a result of excellent planning and the sheer hard work of vaccine teams around Wales. It is wrong to suggest weaposre reliant on an “English buffer” - we have our own – we are simply more efficient at using it.” Matt Hancock resigned from his former role in June  when he admitted he had “no choice” after footage emerged of him kissing Gina Coladangelo at the Department of Healthaposs London HQ in a blatant breach of Covid rules. He had initially tried to cling on to the cabinet role and was replaced by Sajid Javid.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyDepartment of HealthPoliticsCoronavirusMatthew Hancock MP\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In an extraordinary statement on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee, the Queen expressed her wish for Camilla to be known as Queen Consort when Prince Charles takes the throne.For years insiders were sure Camilla would take the title Princess Consort instead - although there had been speculation that Charles wanted his we to be his Queen.  In a message to the nation, the Queen wrote: “When, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his we Camilla the same support that you have given me. “And it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.”In reply, Charles paid tribute to his inspiring mother in a moving statement, admitting heaposs deeply conscious of her wish for Camilla to become his Queen Consort when he takes the throne. However, as many applauded the move, Tom Bower, who is currently writing a biography on Meghan, claims the silence from the Sussexesapos has been deafening.Writing in Fabulous, Tom says the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have not sent any of the customary congratulations or messages of loyalty to their family in London.Prince William is reported to have been supportive of the news. Tom further claims that Harry has never liked Camilla and even blames her for his mumaposs marriage failing.  He writes: Their insult was surely deliberate. It has been said by a number of people that Harry has always disliked Camilla and blamed her for wrecking his parents’ marriage. Perhaps the Sussexes’ deafening silence is Meghan’s way of declaring war. It is believed that she has never liked Camilla, and I am sure the feelings are reciprocated. Tom goes on to say that Camilla may have been suspicious about Meghan. He claims she may have found it hard to believe that Meghan would sacrice her independence to serve silently as a team player devoted to the monarchy. His speculation comes as a royal insider has said Prince Harry and Meghan wonapost join Charles on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after his coronation. A royal source told a newspaper that a slimmed-down monarchywill be on display when Charles finally ascends the throne. They said it was possible that only Prince William, Kate and their children would join Charles and Camilla on the balcony when he becomes King.The Queen was surrounded by her family and maids of honour when she waved to huge crowds below the palace after her coronation in .A source told the Mail On Sunday that Charles wants his coronation to be far cheaper than Her Majestyaposs ceremony, which cost £.million - the equivalent of £million today.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The QueenPrince HarryPrince WilliamPrince Charles, Prince of WalesBuckingham PalaceRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The UK will also be blanketed in snow next week, with almost eight inches of the white stuff possible in some parts of the country.Met Office forecaster Tom Morgan told the Mirror: Wind will be the primary cause for concern next week.Are you ready for aposStorm Dudleyapos  Join the discussion in the comment section Itaposs still a way away, hence why we have only issued a yellow weather warning. There is the potential for us to issue an amber warning and for it to become a named storm. We havenapost named it today as it is  hours away or more. Butwe have more confidence this time tomorrow we may. It would be named Storm Dudley. It will bring damaging winds and cause disruption to power networks, ferry crossings and travel.  Widespread disruption is likely. Gusts of mph are possible in the hills of Scotland butwe see mph gusts in Edinburgh and Glasgow it can cause more disruption. The Met Officeaposs yellow wind alert will be in force from pm on Wednesday until the same time on Thursday. Forecasters have sounded the alarm over large waves, flying debris potentially posing a aposdanger to leapos and the risk of trees collapsing on buildings. They also warned that the weather could lt up objects on beaches and throw them against sea fronts, coastal roads and properties.  The weather warning spans all of Scotland, the north of Northern Ireland and a huge chunk of northern England.

The Duke of Sussex’s friends ­predict that the Duchess of Cornwall – unveiled by Her Majesty last week as the future Queen Consort – will come in for particular criticism in the no-holds barred memoir. Harry used his latest public appearance, a video call this week with former Wales rugby captain Gareth Thomas, to pay tribute to his late mother, Diana. But tellingly, he did not say a word about the dramatic news that Camilla, , will in effect become the next Queen when his father Prince Charles, , ascends the throne. His silence “speaks volumes” says one pal, who alleges Harry, , is still not close to Camilla.The friend said: “Although tensions have eased between the two of them over the years, it was more for a show of unity than a close relationship. “There were big problems at the start but as Harry and his brother William aged and matured, things got better and they can now co-exist as adults. “They were never close with her and they still aren’t.”Diana famously referred to Camilla in her  interview for the BBC ’s Panorama when she said there were “three people” in her marriage to Charles.Harry’s potentially explosive book will be published in the run-up to Christmas. His friend added: “He has got lots to say about it. People think he’s keeping a low profile to respect the family but it’s not that.  “He’s writing a book. He’s got a multi-million-pound book deal and he’s keeping a lot of his opinions for that. The memoir deal states that it should include personal details of personal and family arrangements. And it will be a really intimate take on his feelings about his family and what has gone in the breakdown of the relationship. “If they think that he’s gone soft, then they are mistaken.  “Just wait for the book to come out because that will shake the monarchy to the core.” While the future of Camilla has been settled and Prince William, , is said to be supportive and respectful of the proposed change to her status, Harry is said to have snubbed the woman his mother ­allegedly called The Rottweiler.  When teenager Harry was initially introduced to Camilla shortly before the first anniversary of Diana’s  death in a Paris car crash, aged , their encounter was said to be ­awkward and tense. Harry was only , missing his mum terribly and was not in a position to defend her memory. But as time went by, he and William did develop a warmer relationship with Camilla. Harry said in , during an interview to mark his st birthday, that he and William “loved her to bits”. And he also publicly thanked her for making their father “very, very happy”.  But since Harry’s move to America with we Meghan, , he has been keen to ensure that his tragic mother’s memory and legacy are not airbrushed from history. During his heartfelt tribute to his mum this week he said “I could never fill her shoes” – which royal commentators point to as meaning no one  can either. The book is ­expected to be ­published late this year by Random House. Harry, who is now living in Calornia with Meghan and their children Archie, two, and Lilibet, eight months, is working with ghostwriter J. R. Moehringer. The American Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist has penned books with former tennis champion Andre Agassi and Phil Knight, the co-­founder of footwear giant Nike. The memoir is expected to ­explore Harry’s childhood, his time in the military – including in the Afghanistan war – and his marriage to American-born former actress Meghan. In a statement, the prince explained his motivations for putting his story on paper. He said: “I’m writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become. “I’ve worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story – the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned – I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think. “I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what I’ve learned so far and ­excited for people to read a first-hand account of my le that’s accurate and ­wholly truthful.” Our source said that the publishers are keen to grab the Christmas rush and also ensure that the content is timely. They added: “They want to release everything in ­tandem – book, documentary, etc, like a Big Bang all in one go.

Mathew Plumb and Lauren Young met at Glastonbury Festival while he was living in the back of his van.He had always been interested in the outdoors but had arrived at a place where he didn’t know where to turn in his le, he tells Wales Online. And he and his partner chose do something about their passion for sustainable living and embracing nature. The pair now live amongst acres of trees in an idyillic location which looks like itaposs out of a kidsapos story book.Do you live off-grid or have a unique way of living  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story “He needed it I think – the outdoors,” -year-old girlfriend Lauren says of Mathew in the middle of their dense  acres of forestry which is like something out of a children’s fairytale. They live here blissfully with Lauren’s three-year-old cat Baby, four pigs, and  chickens. Lauren moved here originally temporarily after losing her job as an events manager in the first lockdown but the chimes of the birds and the hundreds of “gorgeous” oak trees pulled her back.  Drowned almost secretly in the shadow of the Deri mountain in north Monmouthshire they have no wi, no bath, no television, and no office space. They live on the absolute bare necessities and they love every second of it – almost. Asked how he managed to fall on  acres, woodcutter Mathew said: “Dad bought it for my sister because she was in Brownies then and they wanted a space to take the kids. He could afford it back then – times were dferent.  “I first came here when I was eight or nine. Then I started using a saw to chop the wood when I was . I realised straightaway that I loved it.” After living here for two years alone with his chickens and Kunekune pigs, which hang around him as though they are dogs on a Sunday afternoon walk, he’s now happier than ever with Lauren by his side. You’d be hard pressed to find a more eccentric and artsy pair. When Mathew isn’t chopping wood, hosting campers, or helping children at one of the local schools he is writing poetry – and that is how he met freelance artist Lauren.She joked that Mathew “stalked” her and “lured” her to the forest. “I’m a freelance artist and people often approach me to discuss ideas and Mathew had been following me on social media since we first met so he got in touch about working with him to illustrate his book,” she recalled. “I was in Hackney at the time in a cute little flat I shared with my best mate at the start of the pandemic. “I always like to meet up with clients to gauge exactly what they want. We had some breakfast and he ended up staying the night – on the sofa. Baby was all over him which is strange because she can be nervous with people she’s new to.” “She was sleeping on my head,” Mathew laughed.  Lauren continued: “Mathew then got me here on the pretence of doing an art walk and sculpture trail thing and I came here to stay a couple of weeks for that. In the end I stayed for two months. “When I went back to London I hated it. I had to leave the flat really quickly because I lost my job as an event manager in the pandemic. It was a snap decision really.” Baby is right at home milling between the array of sawn-off timber and makesht wooden huts which make up their home. Is Lauren as accustomed to the surroundings  “It’s cold very often,” she laughed. “But I’m getting used to it. It was really weird – as soon as I came here for the first time I had a feeling I could be here.”Originally from Bedford she’s always been a stickler for the outdoors since growing up on her granddad’s fields where she spent many a weekend. “When I was small my only friends were my cats, dogs, and chickens. I’d have full-on conversations with them and I missed that lestyle. I came here and it reminded me of that. “And there are oak trees. As soon as there are oak trees I know I’m in the right place.”  You’d have to be a seriously closed book not to appreciate the beauty in the tranquillity of their forest but for most living out here would surely be too much to take. The shower is a bucket of water with a hole in its centre hanging on a chain and the toilet is a hole in a wooden bench in a small wooden hut. Itaposs is beautully decorated with Lauren’s creative touch, and the main living area known as the “charcoal shelter” relies on a makesht curtain to block out the wind. Askedshe has ever regretted the leap into the wilderness Lauren said: “I have thought ‘I wish I was back [in London]’ and I miss it all the time. But I prefer it here and I always try to focus on the lovely things that we can have here.”  It is a huge disservice to the pair to only make reference to the loo as an artistic masterpiece. The whole place is brimming with bright colours and beautully carved and woven wood. It is remarkable that a few huts dotted around a woodland can look so homely and warm even on a cold winteraposs morning. “My dad is a carpenter and I’ve always loved it,” Lauren said. “This is all stuff Mathew has built from the trees,” she explains as we pass yet more precisely-chopped trunks which smell every bit as good as they look. “Mike our neighbour is helping us with the roof for one of the huts.” Neighbour is a term used very loosely in this instance.  He’s about  yards down the road but is the closest to them. Mathew says Lauren’s creativity has transformed their woodland. “At the start of Covid it hit home how much we needed to start future-proofing the business and Lauren has brought so many new ideas,” he said. “She does art therapy in the woodland for people who want to come and do that and she does an arts trail. It’s all for the mind – it definitely works. “I can’t just be a tree surgeon. As well as the camping we deliver firewood and charcoal. “The people we tend to attract are wild campers who come with really small tents or just with hammocks and just want to test themselves.  “We don’t take many people at one time. We try to keep it to five pitches so people can’t see each other and so they feel like they’re on their own in secluded woodland. “There is a lot of uncertainty to le at the moment and we want people who come here to be reassured that there are other opportunities and dferent ways to live. “We often get people here who are having a really dficult time and they just need time to be here and to have some space. It’s a form of therapy really.” It’s their own uncertainty in le – particularly for Mathew – which has brought them here. Mathew describes how he was one of the thousands of “hidden homeless” in Britain when he lived in the back of his work van prior to moving to the forest near to where he grew up.  As the cost of living rises what better way to save money than to live in your own woodland  “Before I came here I thought about buying a house,” Mathew said. “I had almost saved enough for a deposit on a small house in Merthyr, which was all I could afford at the time. Then it dawned on me: what am I going to do with a house  I cut trees for a living – that’s what I do and this is who I am. I want to do cool stuff. We couldn’t do everything we do here while trying to pay off a mortgage.” Lauren said: “We would never have afforded to do what we do here and rent because this takes up hours and hours of our time. Mathew always has bookings with work. He does the cutting and I do the labour.” Weekly outgoings for heating, electricity, water, and rent amount to less than £ a month. “It’s mental how much money you can save,” Mathew said.  “I spend nothing on rent, zero on electric as we get all we need from solar , and about £ every six weeks on propane gas. We have four pigs that I breed and  chickens we use for meat and eggs.” The pigs act like gardeners by hoovering up any unwanted vegetation like bramble and ivy, leaving the lush wood-meadow. You can’t walk  yards without nearly stepping on a chicken. “We had a lot more than this,” Mathew laughed. “We had  but a fox got hold of them. It was heartbreaking. I know it sounds silly but you begin to feel a real connection to all the animals.”  They’re in the process of building an eco-friendly chicken hut to keep them as safe as possible. Each small cabin or hut made by the pair has been constructed without concrete and instead rests on wooden planks so as not to disrupt the soil. While he was tempted by “the modern world” Mathew knows he is now in the right place. “I think from my early s I realised I didn’t want to live a conventional le.

More and more people are taking an interest in going off-grid. I think the pandemic has been a wake-up call.” Even for Tarzan-esque Mathew sticking it out in the wilderness through another winter has been a challenge – but they wouldn’t have it any other way.“Mud, weather, cold, the general challenges nature presents to us – it’s all been there,” he said. “But it’s a definite buzz. It’s exhilarating – without a doubt.“It’s all worth it in the spring – our favourite time of the year, watching the world waking up around us.” Lauren added: “We wake up at about am and the cockerels start going and then again at am. I get to sit and listen to the birds while Mathew makes me a cup of tea. What more could you ask for ”You can follow the couple on Instagram @bleu_jean _ and @twometresplumb .

But it turns out there could be a lot your relatives arenapost actually telling you. This was the case for one woman who has recently had her entire le turned upside down after discovering her grandmother had been hiding a major secret.The unnamed woman, who posts on TikTok under the name @thekennedyproj, explained how her family had recently done andMe DNA tests, which uncovered the major lie her gran had been spinning for years - and sheaposd taken the secret to her grave. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.In her video, the woman, whose account says sheaposs aposnot Kennedyapos told how the DNA test showed her family they had many relatives on the grandmotheraposs side - despite the older woman claiming sheaposd been an orphan and only child. They also found out that the grandmother had erased her past, changed her name and pretended to be a dferent race to have a better le. She said: My grandmother took a secret to her grave and we just found out what it was. She passed back in  and at the time we thought she was born in , we knew her name and we knew that she was an orphan and she was an only child and that we had no other family connections to her whatsoever and the family line lived and died with her. So find me confused when our family gets results back from andMe test telling us we are African American, when my grandmother said that we were English and I know, looking at me youaposre going to be very confused because I am too.She went on to say that her family is still figuring out all the details, but that the test matched them up with a family in Virginia, which made sense as her grandparents had met in Maryland and were married there. They got in touch with the other family and they exchanged photos, which was when they discovered their grandmother hadnapost been an only child - she was actually one of  siblings. It turns out that Millicent Vaughn was born Mammy Vaughn back in , not . She was born to a family of  children, all African American living in Virginia, the woman continues. While her parents did die when she was young, she was not an orphan and an only child like she had said. She had decided to run away from her family and completely exorcise herself from her identity. She picked up a new name, she picked up a new race and she completely erased who she was.

Authorities in Latvia say they are aware of more than  fake profiles featuring snaps of suave Artis Pabriks. One con artist, posing as aposMurphy Townsendapos, swindled Brit Sharon Bulmer out of thousands after he sent her a Facebook message saying he was lonelyapos in May . He spent two years telling her he was a US soldier who needed money to leave Syria and visit her, before she discovered he was not a real person. It was then that the pictures he claimed were of him were actually of Mr Pabriks - the Minister of Defence. The Latvian Defence Office said they have been facing this situation for a long time and have reported over  fake profiles using the ministeraposs images. The government is now warning against the issue. Sharon, from Manchester, is still coming to terms with being conned.  The -year-old said: He asked me to help him and I did, but over the time itaposs got me into huge debt and because I have fallen for this person. I just wanted to help him so much. I know I have been a fool but these are the things we do for love. The person behind the account claimed to be a -year-old man from Washington DC, with a -year-old daughter called Helen. aposMurphyapos told Sharon he was serving with the th Infantry Brigade Combat Team at Base  in Raqqa, Syria. But, when Sharon enquired with the US authorities, she was told there was no aposMurphy Townsendapos on their records at all. She said: He always kept things close to his chest. He doesnapost like me asking questions. Sharon had ended her relationship with her partner of  years in order to start a new le with aposMurphyapos. She then forked out nearly £, over the two-and-a-half year period for ious hospital bills and plane tickets - and is now in £, worth of debt.  Sharon, a team leader at a Covid site, sent aposMurphyapos the cash in Bitcoin. But not once did she video call him - as heaposd told her he wasnapost allowed to at his base. The mum wishes to share her story to stop other people getting tricked the way she has been. Sharon said: I wanted to take my children on holiday, I was going to take them to New York last year, but because he was constantly hammering for money I couldnapost. I want to help anyone out there to not be taken by these idiots and just try and get on with my le. aposMurphyapos first got in touch with Sharon in May  by sending her two Facebook messages. She said: He said he was lonely, heaposs serving in Syria, his we had passed away and he just wanted someone to speak to. He said heaposd been watching me on Facebook, I donapost know what that means. After exchanging a few messages, Sharon gave Murphy her email address and they continued the chat on Google Hangouts.  She said: Murphy was sweet when I first met him, nothing at all made me think anything dferent about him. He was very interesting when I kept talking to him. I felt loved in a way, I felt cared for. I think itaposs because heaposs an older person, he had an older head. At the time Sharon was in a relationship with a man whoaposd sheaposd lived with for  years, and they had two children together. She split up with him in August . In September, after talking online every day, Murphy askedhe could go and visit Sharon in Manchester. After she accepted, he asked her for £, to pay for his flight, and asked her to pay via Bitcoin. But after not hearing from Murphy for a few days, she received a message from a dferent email address, but also with the name Murphy Townsend. They asked for another £, for the plane ticket and, believing it was Murphy, Sharon paid up. At the end of the month, she received a message from someone claiming to be a doctor who said that Murphy had been taken into hospital. She said: He said, aposheaposs unconscious but heaposs okay, everything is going according to plan and weaposre keeping him in hospitalapos. Sharon didnapost ask which hospital he was in but, believing Murphy was injured, she didnapost contact him until he messaged her at the start of October. She said: He wanted to know where Iaposd been when Iaposd not been in contact with him. Thataposs when I told him Iaposd been scammed by someone  using his email address. He couldnapost believe it. Murphy claimed that heaposd been shot in the side on the way to the airport, and that he was due to stay in hospital for another six weeks. He also said he was unable toto the army base because heaposd lied and told them he was leaving to back to his family in the States, rather than his British lover. Sharon then twigged that the messages she got from the second email address was a scam. She said: I said, aposhave you lost anything apos, and he said, aposI lost my computer when I went downapos. So thataposs when I knew thataposs where the scammer came in, they would have had a look at the computer I think.Murphy then asked Sharon for £, to help with his medical bills, which she paid, before announcing that he wanted to leave the army for good and move in with her in Manchester. When he gets out heaposs going back home, sorting a few things out, bringing his daughter over here, and weaposre all setting up a new le, she said. In October , he started asking for weekly payments, between £ and £, to cover the cost of administration fees, airlting fees and to buy him out of his contract. She said: The transactions were long as my arm. Iaposve literally fallen in love with this person, I hope to God he is Murphy. The requests for cash kept coming, with Murphy asking for £, in February  for a trip to the UK, but later claiming heaposd lost the ticket. In August last year, when she asked for pictures of him, he sent her a screenshot of photos from the Facebook profile of aposMike Douglasapos, telling her he couldnapost use social media while on a mission. He also claimed that his original Facebook page had been hacked by the men who stole his computer, and that is why a dferent name of aposMofsjol Dukhanapos has appeared on a page using his photo. In November last year he asked for £, to see his daughter in Washington, and then a further £, for the medical assessment he needed to board the plane that she paid for late last month. Up until a final £ transferred last week, Sharon has paid over £, towards what she believes is getting Murphy out of Syria and to see her. aposMurphyapos also sent her a copy of a letter from aposDr Abdulrahman Alomairapos, a Paediatric Orthopaedic Surgeon. He sent a letter from Al Mouwasat University Hospital that said he was part of a a apospedestrian-vehicle traffic accidentapos in September  that he is currently in intensive care. The letter was dated th January . She said: He is supposed to be in hospital with a serious condition from his accident, but why all of a sudden is he in hospital but never complained about any pain in the year we have been together  The letter is signed by a doctor who treats children with special bones. I donapost get it. Suspecting she has been scammed, Sharon then approached the US Army to ask whether there was anyone named Murphy Townsend serving. They responded saying aposthere is not anyone by the name of Murphy Townsend currently serving in the Army Reserveapos or as a General Officer. They also said that the th Infantry Brigade Combat Team that he claims to be part of is from the Ohio National Guard and not the Army Reserve. There are no LT Generals in that team. She said: I questioned him on that and he turned round and sent to me are you dumb. She hasnapost told her family but Sharon is in thousands of pounds of debt after sending the money to Murphy. She said: My ex does slightly know of him, but he doesnapost know all the ins and outs. No one  know, I want to keep my family out of it. They are starting to be suspicious though. The Latvian Defence Office confirmed it was aware of the continuing issue of identity theft involving the Defence Minister Artis Pabriks. A spokesperson said: Unfortunately, we have been facing this situation for a long time. We receive information about the ious fake profiles that use the name and images of Mr Pabriks on Facebook and Instagram both from the users of the social networks themselves, and our partners and colleagues in other countries. We frequently receive screenshots from people who have been contacted by fraudsters and, recognising the official accounts of the Defence Minister, choose to report them. So far, we have collected and reported to Facebook more than  fake accounts, but the response has been negative. We feel that the security of everyday users both on Facebook and Instagram needs to be strengthened and supported in situations like these, and we encourage Facebook to pay more attention to these kinds of cases.

Lawyers for the -year-old Russian prodigy were pleading her case to the International Court for the Arbitration of Sport, which is to decide her fate. The hearing was called after it emerged Kamila had tested positive for banned heart drug trimetazidine on Christmas Day during national championships. The test result did not emerge until last Tuesday when she was due to collect a gold medal for the Russia Olympic Committee figure skating team in the Beijing Games. The medal ceremony had to be postponed pending the outcome of Kamila’s case. Russian anti-doping agency Rusada, which was also giving evidence at the CAS hearing in the blizzard-hit Chinese capital yesterday, lted her automatic suspension for the positive test to allow her to compete in the inidual event tomorrow.  That decision has been challenged by the International Olympic Committee, the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Skating Association. Under WADA rules, Kamila must prove she did not take the substance deliberately and that it was in a contaminated product. Russian experts believe it could have been present in the low-quality medication. Sports lawyer Artyom Patsev said: “It is not even a drug, it’s a heart supplement, and it provides no [beneficial] results. “Theoretically, any medication, any biologically active supplement, even the most innocent amino acid complex, simply contaminated with trimetazidine, could have become a source.”  The International Testing Agency confirmed it had taken  days tothe test result, due to staff at a lab in the Swedish capital Stockholm going down with Covid. WADA rules state that a test result must be ed within  days. In , a temporary suspension on Russian bobsleigh athlete Nadezhda Sergeeva at the Pyeongchang Olympics in South Korea was lted by the CAS after it ruled trimetazidine found in a doping test could have come from a contaminated product. Russian skater Gleb Smolkin said of Valieva: “She is a great skater and has definitely a great future. It doesn’t matter what happened or is going to happen.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Ice skatingBeijing Olympic Games\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Western countries have warned of crippling sanctionsRussia invades Ukraine, however, Mr Tatarintsev dismissed these threats. He said: Excuse my language, but we donapost give a s**t about all their sanctions.  We have already had so many sanctions and in that sense, theyaposve had a positive effect on our economy and agriculture. We are more self-sufficient and have been able to increase our exports. We have no Italian or Swiss cheeses, but weaposve learned to make just as good Russian cheeses using Italian and Swiss recipes.Today Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis said a Russian invasion could be imminent. Speaking to Skyaposs Trevor Phillips On Sunday: We have to be realistic about Russia having , troops now roughly on the border that an imminent incursion by Russia is entirely possible.His comments echo Defence Secretary Ben Wallaceaposs warning from last night. He said during an interview with The Sunday Times, that Putin could strike at any time.Mr Wallace said there is a “whf of Munich in the air”, in an apparent reference to the agreement that allowed German annexation of the Sudetenland in  but failed to prevent the Second World War. The Cabinet minister, who this week flew to Moscow as part of the frantic spell of diplomacy, shared his concerns as US President Joe Biden warned his Russian counterpart an attack would cause “widespread human suffering”.During an hour-long phone call, Mr Biden told the Russian president an attack would “diminish Russia’s standing” as heightened fears of an attack caused western nations including Britain to urge citizens to flee Ukraine.  During the interview, Mr Wallace said that Moscow could “launch an offensive at any time”, with an estimated , Russian troops and heavy firepower amassed along Ukraine’s border. “It may be that hejust switches off his tanks and we all go home but there is a whf of Munich in the air from some in the West,” he added. A source explained that Mr Wallace’s concerns thatMr Putin strikes “come what may, then all the diplomacy would have been a straw man”. US officials have discussed receiving intelligence that Russia is considering Wednesday as a target date to strike, but it was unclear how definitive the intelligence was. Today, Mr Wallace revealed on Twitter on Sunday afternoon that he would end a planned half-term break with his we and three children.

Every pound raised will add up to help keep children safe.It is free for any school to sign up and once a school has registered, the NSPCC will send it everything it needs to make its Number Day a success.Schools will be sent tips and ideas on how to fundraise, including games and activities resources to help promote Number Day information on keeping children safe from harm and online safety quizzes that can be used with pupils of all ages. After the challenges of the past  months and the disruption that children have faced, we hope it will be a day of fun to look forward to.To sign up to take part in Number Day, all you need to do is visit the NSPCC’s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school’s details using the registration form.Head of Fundraising for NSPCC Scotland Paul CockramSirThere is a real emergency for colleges coming after years of underinvestment. Regarding the sector, the debate on funding should focus on the perilous choices some colleges will now have to make, and on the signicant challenge this Draft Budget poses for the next academic year.The total funding loss of £. million means, for example, freezing recruitment, outsourcing support activities, possible changes to temporary contracts, increasing class sizes and consolidating classes.All of these would be a last resort, however, after years of under investment this Budget leaves no more space to manoeuvre in. Unless there are improvements to the Budget, noticeable changes to colleges are inevitable.We believe this risks Scotland sliding into a skills emergency. Even in the midst of a pandemic colleges have provided world class education and training to hundreds of thousands of students.But in order to continue there has to be investment based in reality. Scotland’s recovery depends on creating year after year a workforce that is qualied and able – but with the proposed Budget settlement, colleges will be challenged in ways not seen for many years.Chair of Colleges Scotland Ken Milroy MBEThe Poverty and Inequality Commissionhas published advice to the Scottish Government on its Child Poverty Delivery Plan -SirOur advice shows that, quite simply, too many children are still experiencing poverty in Scotland. As a society we believe it’s wrong for children’s lives to be restricted by poverty. That’s why the child poverty targets were set.While we know work is ongoing, progress is not enough to meet the targets, and for some measures the position is worsening. Despite a clear commitment, the action taken by the Scottish Government so far is inadequate We need to see Holyrood using all the levers available to end the scourge of child poverty.We need to see action across all areas of Government in order to release families from the constraints of poverty. Providing parents with support to apply for a job, for example, won’t have the impact we wantthe parent can’t get suitable childcare or doesn’t have a reliable bus service to get them to work.Targets to reduce child poverty can be met, however the Scottish Government will have to utilise every opportunity and deliver action faster, coupled with a signicant increase in fundingWe are committed to working with the Scottish Government to eradicate child poverty and ensure it remains one of its top priorities. It will take a concerted joint effort from PIC, the Scottish Government and its partners to resolve these issues and ensure our children have the very best start in le.Chair of the Poverty and Inequality Commission Bill Scott "},{"url":null,"title":"help elaine conquer the world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll#s very own racing star Elaine MacEachern is aiming for the top # but she needs help.Just four months after breaking her leg at the Women#s Motocross World Championships in Madrid, talented Elaine is hungry to test herself once more against the very best.After a three-year break from the sport, Ormsary girl Elaine stormed to the  British Women#s Motocross title.Moving on to the world championship Spanish round, there was disappointment as the rigours of practise left her with a broken tibia and fibula.Now fit again and excited for , Elaine is looking for new sponsors.She explained: #The support I receive is incredibly kind and a huge factor in me being able to achieve the British championship in .#This year my plans are to defend the women#s British title, to race as many women#s world championship rounds as possible and also in the MX class in the ScotMX championship alongside the men.#For the women#s British they have moved from three rounds to six.

The lighting looked to be sufficient but there was one broken lamp post which will be fixed by SBC. It is also a very lonely path to walk. Therefore, I would also say that some areas would require CCTV as a deterrent and to know that there are eyes watching.”The path is a busy and popular walkway which starts opposite Asda and continues to Tweedbank and beyond. Most of the path is not overlooked by houses which makes it potentially vulnerable and there have been a number of incidents over the years.Community Councillor Bill White said: “The walk we did was well worthwhile. It pointed out a few points and identied a few areas of concern to look at and hopefully we can take this forward.“I’ve already said that I think we should change the name of it from the Black Path. There needs to be some landscaping done and there are some areas where a little more lighting could help. CCTV would certainly put people off and maybe make people feel a bit safer.

He said: : “Fortunately such incidents fairly rare in the Borders, but we can’t become complacent. My advice would be to be aware of your own surroundings, keep your phone about you and let your family knowyou’re walking along here late at night. If you are walking on the path and you are concerned about anyone you see, oryou think you’re being followed, then just contact the police straight away on .\".removeCommunity council chairperson Judith Cleghorn said: “It could be such a beautul walk.

Kick off is .pm.Campbeltown Pupils# squad: Lorne Paterson, Conner Brown, Jamie Burns, Ross Souden, Craig Johnstone, John McCallum, Stuart Crossan, Donald McCallum, Ellis Robertson, Kenny Kerr, Ryan Deans.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

held two online sessions recently to highlight the project, amid concern by Musselburgh and District Angling Clubabout the issue of mine water discharge, fearing it was having “a negative effect on the fish and invertebrate communities in the South Esk”.These concerns predate the recent pollution incident in the River Esk last month.Residents who attended the Coal Authority sessions heard more details about the plans for the treatment scheme at Dalkeith, which will remove iron and manganese from water flowing from a historical drainage tunnel adjacent to Newmills Road, known locally as Junkies Adit.The tunnel is linked tothe extensive underground coal mine workings in the Midlothian area.In recent years, the amount of mine water discharging from Junkies Adit has been increasing and the water quality has been deteriorating, the Coal Authority said.The organisation explained that the water affected was visibly orange, which was a result of naturally occurring iron dissolving in the mine water underground, which then became solid as it mixed with air and settled out of the water.In recent years, the discolouration has become more visible further downstream and could affect the river’s ecologyleft untreated, the Coal Authority added.The Coal Authority has been working with the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand other partners to monitor the problem and develop a solution.Details for planning approval will be submitted shortly, with a view to starting the main construction later this year.More detailed design work will be done in the coming months to develop the scheme, and residents and stakeholders will have the chance to provide feedback as the designs progress.John Batty, Coal Authority project manager, said: “I think a lot of residents are keen to see this project progress as the river is so visibly orange as a result of the mine water, and the negative impact on the wildle and ecology is widely known.“The mine workings are complex so it has taken many years to get to this point.“We have been working to carry out studies and investigations, evaluate potential solutions and establish water quality by taking water samples on a regular basis through the challenges of the pandemic.“We have undertaken research using a test treatment scheme on site last spring that provided a large amount of information to feed into the designs.”Paul Butler, SEPA mining sector lead, said: “We are pleased that the progress we have made together has enabled the Coal Authority to provide information on the proposals for a new mine water treatment scheme at the site of Junkies Adit.”Colin Beattie, MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, said: “I think it is important that the public are involved with the process and it is vital public engagement continues as the scheme progresses.“I look forward to seeing the next stages of the treatment scheme and working with the Coal Authority, SEPA and the local community on this project.”Steven Dalgleish, of MDAA, said: “No faulting the Coal Authority’s commitment to the cause but the association remains gravely concerned that funding may not appear for this project.“From some of our own research, it seems that this may remain an issue for over  years, leaving the South Esk between Dalkeith and its junction with the North Esk effectively dead and useless as the main salmon and sea trout spawning bed area it once was.”"},{"url":null,"title":"driving-ban-drink-driver-pulled-longniddry","story":"Oliver Moss, of College Way, was pulled over by police officers at Main Street in

Council to refuse planning permission for the flats, describing the new build as “over-dominant”.The proposal by Edinburgh-based BY Developments Ltd would see the bungalow on Gullane Main Street demolished and replaced by a passivhaus building containing four three-bedroom flats.In a letter to the local authority, the community council said that while it did not object to the idea of flats on the site, the current proposals were too big and it added that the design appeared to include windows which were just one metre from neighbouring houses, adding: “It is hard to imagine this providing adequate lighting.”The proposals to replace the house, known as Glen Maree, with the flats aims to make it as sustainable as possible, with its design statement describing the residential development as “net zero”.It will include electric car charging points at a private parking area to the rear of the property, solar  and non-fossil fuel heating systems.The roof design has been created to ensure maximum solar exposure to support the flats and the design statement points out that easy access to public transport is also available to new residents of the flats.It adds: “This development makes efficient use of land, buildings and infrastructure by altering a previously developed plot of land in a town centre rather than a greenfield site on the town periphery, for example.“Industry-leading Scottish cross laminated timber is to form the superstructure, whilst Passivhaus principals of airtightness, heat recovery and solar gain are to be employed to create very efficient, low-energy dwellings.“We believe this strategy will result in a very energy-efficient use of the plot, with the four new apartments using less energy than the existing building.“We intend to create an exemplar development that demonstrates sustainability without compromising design quality.”The design statement adds that the site itself is not in the Gullane Conservation Area but “on the periphery” of it.Despite plans to position the new building eight metres back from the Main Street pavement with a large front garden area, the community council said that the design did not fit the site.It said: “We have no issue with the general principle of creating flatted accommodation on the site.“The particular choice of design, creating four substantial flats across three floors rather than the two of the neighbouring houses, does appear to be over-dominant in scale.“Eventhe building were able to be set slightly further back this effect could be diminished, but the site appears not to lend itself to this.”The application is available to view on the council planning portal."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-gift-card-scheme-saw-sales-rocket-first-pandemic-christmas","story":"The East Lothian

Lothian Investments on behalf of the local authority as a year-round offer following the success of the council’s Christmas shop local campaign, which had run for a decade.Hundreds of cards were sold

Veerman’s Pets  Co in Tranent, said: “We have always welcomed all customers into the shop with a smile, and we feel that this is especially important today as high streets up and down the country struggle to compete with online giants and out-of-town shopping centres.“We have been involved with the East Lothian Gt Card scheme from the outset, as it was created specically to encourage customers to think locally.“This is very important to us, as we also live in Tranent and know that money spent locally stays in the community.”No figures are available for the current financial year yet

One evening in  I was sitting in a student flat in Stirling listening to Janice Long on Radio . During her handover to John Peel, she dedicated the last record she played to the veteran DJ. The track in question was Speed Your Love to Me by Simple Minds, I think. Or maybe it was Up on the Catwalk.What I do remember more clearly, though, is John Peel’s response at the start of his ownprogramme. “Thanks, Janice, for that piece of pomp rock,” he saidbefore pressing play on something that was more to his liking .In my head it was a marker of how things were on the turn. Two years previously the reputation of Simple Minds couldn’t have been greater. The release of the New Gold Dream album both propelled them into the charts and into the album of the year lists in the music press. It felt like the culmination of the band’s steady progress from punky wannabes to art rock giants, “a gradual, heady ascent up a huge mountain,” the music critic Dave Simpson once suggested.New Gold Dream was the mountain top. A hypnotic, pulsing, thrilling thing. One of the great Scottish albums.But with its anthemic feel and thunderous percussion, the release of Waterfront in October , the first single off the Sparkle in the Rain album, flagged up the fact that the band were beginning to drop the art and concentrate on the rock. As a result, they began to lose the critical acclaim and cult status and became a global success. Swings and roundabouts.In the years that followed the Minds would rack up hit after hit and bad review after bad review. When it comes down to it, most bands would. quite understandably, prefer the former over the latter.However, success fixed the image of the band in the public consciousness. As the years – decades now – have passed, they are usually remembered as the band who gave us Alive and Kicking and Belfast Child and recorded Keith Forsey and Steve Schf’s Don’t Youfor the film The Breakfast Club . The shimmering electro of early singles such as I Travel or The American, the songs I danced to in a Stirling student disco, are often overlooked.So, one of thepleasures of Graeme Thomson’s new book on the band, Themes for Great Cities, is its desire to be an act of reclamation.Thomson wants to challenge the lazy cliches that have attached to the band’s reputation, to complicate the story, to, as he says in his introduction, “remysty” his subject. To that end he revisits the early years of the band and suggests why they matter.He follows the bands from Toryglen to the charts, concentrating on their earliest records, from ’s Le in a Day to ’s brace, Sons and Fascination and Sister Feelings Call. Records touched by the influence of both krautrock and Giorgio Moroder, post-punk and prog. This was music, Manic Street Preacher James Dean Bradfield once suggested, made by “crystalline gods.”And music made not just by singer Jim Kerr and guitarist Charlie Burchill, the faces of Simple Minds now for over four decades, but by all of the band’s original line-up. The democratic first incarnation of the band was fuelled as much by Derek Forbes’s bass, Mick MacNeill’s keyboards and Brian McGee’s drumming as by Burchill and Kerr. All five members contributed to the sound of Simple Minds.“It was very much a collective,” Thomson tells me when we speak in January. “I like that autodidactic thing of young working-class people stretching themselves, pushing themselves and absorbing all these influences and just how abstract a lot of that music is. It’s very challenging, I think it’s still very fresh. I think it warrants a listen. I like the fact that it’s not canonised.”Thomson, who has written acclaimed books on Kate Bush and John Martyn, is a long-time Simple Minds admirer. Now , he was  or  when he first discovered them around the release of Sparkle in the Rain, when the band were nearing their commercial peak. Like a true fan he then went back to explore their earlier records.One of the reasons for writing the book, he says, was simply to celebrate their nascent achievements. “You want to write about the music you love, and these albums are among the earliest and first records I ever loved,” he points out.“You also look for fresh ground. I don’t think those records have been written about, compared to a lot of the records in the canon. Even post-punk records that at the time were quite marginal, like Unknown Pleasures, are now part of the musical establishment.”The story Thomson tells is of a young band moving fast, constantly changing, looking outwards to the continent In central Europe men are marching …”, growing up, finding their feet.And that explains how they became more and more central to the story of pop by the mid-eighties. They’d found a map to take them from the outskirts to the centre of the city. Next stop, stadium tours.“They get this accusation of selling out,” Thomson suggests, “and I suppose I wanted people to see how they started making that bigger music in the mid-eighties and how it was organic in a way. It kind of makes sense when you see how their story evolved.“I think when a band’s made six or seven records before they have a hit it’s hard to accuse them of being cynical.”Simple Minds at their mid-s peak The story of Simple Minds is the story of the s, a story of experimentalism followed by ato classicism. They were not the only ones who followed a similar trajectory.The Waterboys, led by Mike Scott, sang of their quest to capture “the big music” on their  album A Pagan Place and they weren’t alone in that desire. Big Country, U and even Echo and the Bunnymen were all chasing the same goal at the same time.It was a moment when horizons broadened and, Thomson suggests, old worlds were rediscovered. In the book he paints a picture of a group of young men from Glasgow, perhaps disillusioned with their surroundings, who go and experience Paris and Berlin and thenhome and begin to see that Glasgow is also European.“And you start to reflect more of your own culture,” Thomson suggests. “And I think you can hear that in Simple Minds when it starts to become a bit more Celtic, a bit more elemental.”More than that, though, the band was changing too. Drummer Brian McGee left in  and bassist Derek Forbes left in . Line-ups change and the music being made is transformed as a consequence.“You can argue that Simple Minds have been many dferent bands really,” Thomson suggests. “There are two central figures, but when you lose a drummer and you lose the bass player, then it becomes a dferent band, and you work in a dferent way. The music inevitably is going to change.“Brian McGee the drummer was replaced by Mel Gaynor, who is this huge propulsive rocket launcher of a drummer and I think that changed the sound.”The thunderous drive of Waterfront was the first evidence of that.Simple Minds the band have continued to evolve over the years, have been, as Thomson says, many bands. And yet their image is frozen at the point of maximum visibility, in their mullety, sing-along-chorused commercial peak.“It’s a picture in reverse,” Thomson says. “Simple Minds started complicated and got more accessible. U did the opposite. They wanted to become more experimental, and I think when you start from a point where you are painting pretty crude pictures, as U were, it’s easier to mess with that.“U borrowed a lot from Simple Minds. Simple Minds were ahead chronologically, and I think artistically, for a long time. New Gold Dream certainly had a huge impact on U. You can hear it on The Unforgettable Fire.“And also, like the Tory party, U stuck together. They managed not to lose any members. Keeping the same personnel in place during your whole career is going to enable you to do that.“By the early s Simple Minds were just Jim and Charlie. And then you are working with session musicians, and I think it becomes much more dficult in that scenario to find that spot.Author Graeme Thomson “The band that goes weird is always acclaimed. If you start off quite mainstream and then go weird people see that as a very courageous thing.”Thomson has spoken to most of the original members of Simple Minds in writing his book. Does their reputation matter to them  Do they yearn for the excitement of those early years “Jim is very relaxed now. I think it feels very old to him and he can point to all the success the band has had since then.”“I think they understand why diehard fans love that stuff, but it’s not something they can replicate. It was a very long time ago.” Themes for Great Cities by Graeme Thomson is published by Constable, £"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13462568.jpg?type=article-full","title":"traces-tv-drama-starring-laura-fraser-martin-compston-returns","story":"“But that tiny bone doesn’t change from the womb to the tomb. If you analyse that bone, it will tell you where your mother was living when she was pregnant with you.”McDermid, , can rattle off a raft of intriguing details like this from her encyclopaedic knowledge of forensics, gleaned across  years of plotting novels packed with murder, suspense and insidious deeds.As you might imagine, she has no shortage of fascinating anecdotes. Like the time that anatomist and forensic anthropologist Professor Dame Sue Black taught her how to break the hyoid, a small horseshoe-shaped bone in the neck.Or when forensic chemist Professor Niamh Nic Daeid laid bare the damage that can be wreaked by fires in confined spaces, with a gasp-inducing video clip of a synthetic Christmas tree-turned-towering inferno after an electrical spark ignited its branches.The ear bone McDermid mentions is one such nugget that the Fe-born author plans to incorporate into a book at some point: a tool that could help pinpoint the circumstances of a grisly death or provide important clues about an anonymous murder victim.“The things that are still fascinating to me are what the anthropologists dig up,” she says. “The analysis they can do of your biological material to tell you things like where you lived.”Tantalising titbits like these are woven throughout Traces, the TV drama starring Laura Fraser and Martin Compston, which s to our screens for a second series this week.The crime thriller, co-created by McDermid, focuses on the work of the fictional Scottish Institute of Forensic Science and Anatomyin Dundee. Its twisting plot follows three forensic professionals – Fraser, alongside Molly Windsor and Jenner Spence – as they analyse crime scene evidence.Val McDermid on the set of Traces in Dundee. Picture: Alibi UKTV Traces was inspired by the work of the many remarkable women scientists that McDermid has got to know well over the years.They include the aforementioned Professor Dame Sue Black, currently at Lancaster University, who is world-renowned for her pioneering work at the Centre for Anatomy and Human Identication and the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, both created during her  years at Dundee University.McDermid has also spent time picking the brains of Professor Niamh Nic Daeid, who continues to oversee the ground-breaking research happening in Dundee, alongside colleague and leading forensic anthropologist Professor Lucina Hackman.Professor Dame Sue Black has become world-renowned for her work as an anatomist and a forensic anthropologist. Picture: Morgan SilkWired The Conde Nast Publications Ltd PA When making Traces there was never any doubt in McDermid’s mind that a trio of female scientists should be at the fore. “Right from the start, that was one of the key elements of putting the production together,” she says. “Forensic science is so often led by women. An awful lot of leading forensic scientists are women.“We wanted to make a drama that put women front and centre. Not just the three scientists, but the producers, the exec producers, the directors and much of the cast are female. It was one of the very first completely female-led productions when we made the first series.“That is now almost becoming something that is not worth commenting on, but when we were making the first series of Traces, there wasn’t anything quite like it in terms of the make-up of the team.”: Five great Scottish thrillers and crime novels headed for our TV screens The debut series of Traces, filmed between Dundee and Manchester, aired on Alibi in  and was then shown on BBC One last year. McDermid worked closely with Scott  Bailey actor and writer Amelia Bullmore in developing its premise. They are both thrilled, she says, that it is back for a second run.“It was pretty much the same as the first series,” says McDermid, describing their collaborative process. “We had some basic ideas and brainstormed them. We came up with the basic storyline we wanted to pursue and then Amelia ran with it.“We spent time with Niamh Nic Daeid and Lucina Hackman, the two professors at Dundee. Then essentially, I stepped back, hands off, and let Amelia get on with it. As the script drafts came through, I looked at them to seethere was anything that didn’t make sense to me.”Martin Compston, Molly Windsor, Jenner Spence, Laura Fraser and Michael Nardone in the new series of Traces. Picture: Alibi UKTV Traces being recommissioned for a second series has given them scope to develop the characters and flesh out the storylines. “That’s what you need, otherwise it becomes a dry recitation of the forensics,” says McDermid.“But, believe me, as we go forward through this series, the forensic detail is front and centre again. And it is surprising stuff. We have been very fortunate in that we are working with forensic scientists who are at the leading edge of research and so we are learning about things that are just coming on stream.“I don’t want to say anything in too much detail because …” McDermid purposely trails off. Spoilers  She is keeping tight-lipped. What we do know is that the plot of the new series will centre around a clutch of improvised explosive devices being set off in and around Dundee.Was any inspiration drawn from real-le cases  “No, absolutely not,” says McDermid. “We drew on the forensic experiences of Niamh and Lucina, but in terms of actual cases, no.“It is dficult to say anything about this without it being a spoiler but when people see it, they may jump to the conclusion it is based on something, a real case, but the scripts were all written and in production before that happened.\"That gave us a sharp intake of breath. When le imitates art, it is eerie, but you also have to then ask questions about the material we have and whether it is exploitative in the light of subsequent events.Laura Fraser as Professor Sarah Gordon and Molly Windsor as Emma Hedges. Picture: Alibi UKTV “We looked at it very carefully and we all agreed that it was OK, that we weren’t being exploitative, not least because we had done the work before the event as it were.”Breaking Bad star Laura Fraser plays Professor Sarah Gordon, a forensic chemist at the fictional University of Tayside and director of SIFA.Jenner Spence, known for her roles in Stargate Universe and Continuum, is forensic anthropologist Professor Kathy Torrance, with Three Girls actor Molly Windsor as intrepid lab technician Emma Hedges.How do the real-le scientists McDermid knows feel seeing their line of work depicted on screen  “They are happy with it because we have taken the time to get the detail right. That is what pleases them. That is why they got involved in the first place because we committed to doing it properly.“They have a giggle when they see who is playing them on screen – they find that quite amusing because they are not very like them in real le.”Behind the scenes during filming of Traces series two. Picture: Alibi UKTV The million-pound question, which McDermid has no doubt been asked countless times throughout her career, is why we as readers and TV viewers have such a fascination with crime and forensics. Is it the puzzle, the macabre, the fear, the titillation – or something  “A lot of it is curiosity. We want to know how things work,” she says. “The great thing with forensic science, particularly as it has developed in recent years, is we get answers, and you can see how we got to the answer. I think people find that really satisfying.“Often le events and the world around us doesn’t produce a logical conclusion and answer. The great thing about forensics and crime fiction in general is you get a resolution.\"Or,you don’t get a resolution or an answer, at least you know where you are. When terrible things are happening all around us, it is good to have something that produces the comfort of resolution.”That is something which feels particularly pertinent in the present day. “We have had two years of living in limbo, most of us, not knowing from one month to the next how our lives were going to be,” says McDermid.“It is a comforting space to be in when you are watching a drama, or indeed a true-le series about forensics, to know there are answers out there. We have also in the last couple of years come to understand the importance of the role of scientists developing new ideas and finding solutions.\"It is hard to think back two years when we didn’t have a vaccine – we didn’t even have a test when Covid arrived. But the scientists put their heads down, dug in and came up with the answers. I think that is something we have all become much more aware of and gratied by.“Before all this happened, Michael Gove was going about saying, ‘we have had enough of experts.’ Sorry Michael, you were wrong on that one.”Laura Fraser as Professor Sarah Gordon filming series two of Traces in Dundee. Picture: Alibi UKTV A  study at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign found that women tend to be drawn towards true crime stories more than men, and that they are typically most interested in those that give insight into the killer’s motives, how victims escaped or that feature female victims.Is that something McDermid, who penned the non-fiction guide Forensics: The Anatomy of Crime in , has found from speaking to her readers  “Yes and I think maybe part of it is we are all wanting to be on the alert for the killers in our lives,” she says.“The acts of violence that are committed against women on a daily basis in this country are still staggering and they are usually committed by people who are very close to us. Maybe part of it is we want to be on the alert.”It is a subject that is always forefront of her mind but arguably even more so over the last fortnight. When we speak the furore over Raith Rovers signing David Goodwillie is sending shockwaves across Scotland.A lelong fan of the Fe club, McDermid first stepped up to be the team’s shirt sponsor in . Her late father Jim, a former scout for Raith Rovers, introduced his daughter to football at an early age.After news of Goodwillie’s signing broke, the author announced she was withdrawing her support and sponsorship of the team. The striker, who previously played for Clyde, was ruled to be a rapist and ordered to pay damages in a civil case in .Writing on Twitter, McDermid said: “The thought of the rapist David Goodwillie running out on the pitch at Starks Park in a @RaithRovers shirt with my name on it makes me feel physically sick.”: Val McDermids anger over Goodwillie signing: How could football get it so wrong Raith Rovers has since admitted it was a mistake to sign Goodwillie and confirmed that he will not be playing in any matches. The club has said it is reviewing his contract.McDermid has stood firm and said she will notwhile the player remains on the payroll and those who authorised his signing are still in charge.Testament to how deep her anger and hurt runs, she tells me: “It has been the first time in  years that I have been glad my dad is not here.”Before becoming an author, McDermid spent  years working as a journalist in the late s and through the s. During that time, she covered big stories including Hillsborough, Lockerbie, the “Yorkshire Ripper” case and the aftermath of the Moors Murders.Her latest novel, , s to that world as told through the eyes of protagonist Allie Burns, an ambitious young reporter on the fictional Glasgow newspaper the Daily Clarion. It marked McDermid’s first new series in almost two decades.Crime author Val McDermid’s latest book, , draws from her former career as a journalist. Picture: Gordon Terris The Herald The book, newly released in paperback, has become her best-selling hardback to date since it was published last August. McDermid is currently working on the next instalment, set a decade later, titled .The adventures of Allie Burns would make a fantastic TV series, I reckon. “Watch this space,” she says, cryptically.Fans of her writing will know  isn’t McDermid’s first book with a journalist at its heart. The six-strong Lindsay Gordon mystery series helped launch her career with debut novel Report for Murder in .There are some interesting rumblings on that one too. “Lindsay Gordon is in development at the moment,” she reveals.: A murky fog of smoke, typewriters and foul deeds: Val McDermids latest novel Early discussions about a potential TV series have given her amusing pause for thought. “The funny thing about Lindsay Gordon is when we first started talking about it, the production company said very seriously, ‘And, of course, it is period drama …’” laughs McDermid, tickled by the notion of the s as ye olde days.Meanwhile, the much-awaited ITV adaptation of her  novel, The Distant Echo, is due to grace our screens later this year. The three-part drama, Karen Pirie, will see Outlander and Vigil star Lauren Lyle play a young police detective investigating a cold case murder in St Andrews.“We have had to make some changes to the storyline because Karen has a very small role in the book originally,” explains McDermid. “But, also, we are concertinaing almost  years of books into a much tighter time frame because the idea is,this goes well, we will make book after book.“So, the timeline has been shted and the story has been adjusted but essentially the heart of it remains the same. I think what we have ended up with is really good television. Lauren does a fantastic job as Karen Pirie.“Quite a lot of people will look at Lauren in the abstract and think, ‘She doesn’t look like the Karen Pirie in my head …’ but when they see her on screen, they will believe her, trust me.”: Outlander star Lauren Lyle on BBC thriller Vigil and ITV crime drama Karen PirieMcDermid has had cameo roles in Traces and an earlier ITV adaptation Wire In The Blood. Will we see her popping up in Karen Pirie  “No, I don’t think so. To be honest, I am getting typecast,” she deadpans. “I keep turning up as a journalist. I just don’t get the chance to show my range …”She may be spinning multiple plates between her books and TV projects, but McDermid never passes up an opportunity to build on her forensics expertise.“I am looking forward to spending a day with Niamh [Nic Daeid] soon because she has a new set up in Dundee which is essentially a constructed crime scene with model ‘bodies’ – they look real,” she says. “I am hoping to spend a day up there with her going through the crime scene bit by bit.”Professor Niamh Nic Daeid is a forensic chemist involved in ground-breaking research at Dundee University Has McDermid had the chance to do anything like that before  “Crime scenes are not places they let people like me wander about and there are not many opportunities to see something like that which has been so meticulously reconstructed.“What I have seen over the years is something by Frances Glessner Lee, an American heiress, who set up the first forensic lab in the US at Hard [in the s]. She did these things that were called ‘nutshell studies’ of crime.“They were basically small-scale dioramas of crime scenes that were used for training detectives. They are like wee doll’s houses of murder.”: Five great Scottish thrillers and crime novels headed for our TV screens Perhaps in another le McDermid might have embarked upon a career in forensics  “I don’t know,” she muses. “I enjoyed chemistry very much when I was at school. But I’m not sure I have the right temperament for a scientist.“You do need to have enormous patience. And be willing to repeat things endlessly to make sure they are replicable. I am not sure I have the right kind of brain for it.

At , he may be in the twilight of his brilliant career but that is an awful lot of experience and know-how to add to a tense situation. Essentially, this was a contest between two evenly matched sides. The Welsh starting XV had a total of  caps to their name at the start of the day, with  more – including two Lions – to come off the bench.

It was a fair result but could easily have gone the other wayjust one of several marginal refereeing calls had been dferent, orEngland had been just a little bit more clinical with the huge amount of possession and territorial advantage they commanded throughout the game.  Seven days later, Scotland are now sitting where England were, mainly because they were out-gunned at the breakdown where Jamie Ritchie was a big miss, while Finn Russell and Stuart Hogghad off days compared to opposite numbers Dan Biggar and Liam Williams. That win at Murrayfield did not make Gregor Townsend’s team world-beaters, and this loss at the Principality Stadium does not make them a national disgrace, as some have suggested.  Frankly,Scotland had put as little effort in and played as badly as is being claimed then this match would have been a - drubbing and not have hung in the balance – as it did – until the very last play. All Scotland can do now is park the disappointment, learn the lessons required, and come back stronger against Grand Slam chasing France in two weekends’ time. They face an almighty challenge against the only team still unbeaten in the championship, who underlined their all-round class when getting the better of Ireland on Saturday evening. “We’ve lost opening games or games in the middle of the Six Nations in the past and come back so we know we can do it,” said head coach Gregor Townsend. “We know the challenge because we’ll be playing against a team that has improved a lot since the last time we played them [Scotland won - in Paris last March], so we’ll have to be much better. “We have two weeks to improve, although for one week we won’t have everyone in camp like the other nations [the  exiles in the -man training squad will need toto their clubs]. I’m sure the determination will be there for everyone to improve. “We are all aware that in any sports team there are going to be performances that aren’t up there with what we aspire to achieve,” he added. “But in defeat it is important that we all stay together, and we work out how we can get better for the following game. “It’s never a nice moment to go in the changing room when your chances of winning the game are over, but it is part of sport.

Out of , sailings just  were cancelled.But since then the rate of cancellations has shot up to just over one in  as concerns surfaced over the viability of the ageing ferry fleet.In , there were , scheduled sailings with  cancellations and in  there were , planned trips with  cancelled.The collapse in August,  of Ferguson Marine Engineeringled by tycoon Jim McColl, which runs the last remaining shipyard on the lower Clyde, came amid soaring costs and delays to the construction of two leline island ferries and resulted in its nationalisation by the Scottish Government.The cost of both vessels has doubled to around £m while their delivery is nearly five years late.Highlands and Islands MSP Edward Mountain, the former convenor of the rural economy and connectivity committee which branded the ferry procurement management process a \"catastrophic failure\" said the figures lay bare the failings of the ferry service and said there should be a full public inquiry.“It has been a year of woe for our island communities, whose daily lives have been disrupted by an aging ferry fleet which is highly susceptible to breakdowns,\" he said. “This new data is yet more proof that the lack of new vessels is having a serious impact on ferry services. The SNP Government have failed to renew the fleet and build resilience into our ferry network.“Many of these ferries are operating beyond their intended lespan. Older boats require more maintenance, but there’s also longer breakdowns and ier repair times too.“No one would expect the First Minister to travel to work in a  year old car, but the SNP Government are expecting islanders to rely on thirty year old ferries.“Island communities are suffering the consequences of the SNP’s lack of forward planning. This is unacceptable and that again is why we need a full public inquiry to investigate this ferry fiasco.”Comhairle nan Eilean Siar has said islands were at \"crisis point as widespread chaos\" engulfed ferry services throughout the Inner and Outer Hebrides in recent days as a result of over-runs in the CalMac dry docking schedule and the breakdown of MV Hebrides.It called for urgent action from Calmac and Scottish Government to ensure leline service is restored and a community voice is listened to.It comes as it emerged problems with the starboard main engine of the -year-old MV Hebrides has meant that the suspension of services to and from Uig on Skye and Lochmaddy in North Uist will last till Sunday. Engineers were carrying out repairs on the vessel which can carry  passengers and  cars on Thursday and CalMac said they were continuing to investigate \"contengency plans\".On Friday four leline services were suspended by pm partly due to weather and partly due to the MV Hebrides breakdown, after three on Thursday and eight the previous day.A substantial amount of emergent steelwork has also been discovered on another of the fleets elderly statesman, the -year-old MV Clansman in dry dock, and this has delayed herby three weeks.But Comhairle nan Eilean Siar has said even when the weather was not bad, ferry breakdowns and delays to new ferries left island communities vulnerable.CalMac has said unforeseen ferry faults have been partly to blame for disruption to leline services in recent weeks which has resulted in islanders raising concerns about empty food shelves.It said: \"We are now well into the third week of extreme and unprecedented weather conditions - one of the longest periods of very poor weather and high signicant wave height for many years,\" the ferry operator said.\"We are experiencing technical faults with some vessels that require urgent repair. In addition, some of our statutory annual overhauls are delayed, while engineers solve unforeseen issues presented during detailed surveys.\"We will continue to work with local communities to ensure their priorities around the transportation of goods and services are understood and supported. Our dedicated frontline staff are talking every day to our regular customers to make sure that essential goods and services are being moved.\"We understand how much our customers and the communities we serve rely on ferry services. Getting ferries working as they should be is our absolute priority, and we thank you for your patience and understanding at what we know is a really dficult time.\"Transport Scotland said Scottish ministers, and the board of state-controlled David MacBrayne Limited, which owns CalMac were listening to islanders.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “We recognise the fragility of some supply chains serving island communities and understand the anxiety that disruption to ferry services can cause.“We are aware of the additional staffing pressures faced by operators due to the Covid pandemic impacting on staff availability because of sickness and self-isolation.“Every effort is made to avoid cancellations and breakdowns, but it is impossible to completely remove the risk of this happening in technically complex vessels. During times of disruption, we always seek to work with operators to deliver additional sailings wherever possible.“We acknowledge the ferry fleet is aging and as such we are delivering new tonnage to support our communities by working with CMAL, CalMac, MSPs, community representatives and others to develop investment programmes - at least £ million over the next five years - for major vessels and small vessels.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"February ,  at : amOrkney could be set for a record-breaking cruise liner season.

I would have wished us to stay a bit calmer and cooler but we had the chances.“So, I don’t think that this is a question of physicality with regard to fitness but, yes, it might well be.“As I said, the players that we have are technical players, they like to play technical football but in the Premier League no matter against which team – even more so against teams like Southampton – you cannot win games only in a technical way. You also have to show some physicality.” vw,vw,px, px\"Ralf Rangnick was named Manchester United interim boss in late November following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s departure United end the weekend fth in the Premier League standings knowing Arsenal, Wolves and Tottenham below them have at least one game in hand.Askedhe was concerned the club might slip out the Champions League racethey do not soon improve their form, Rangnick said: “It has always been a concern since Ole left the club – that was one of the reasons probably why he had to leave the club.“Of course results likedoesn’t make things any easier. In the game against Villa, Burnley and , we were - or - and gave away two points.“This can happen once but it shouldn’t happen three times and with four points more the situation would be dferent but it’s not and this is what we have to face.“We have to face and realise the truth and obviously with results likeit doesn’t make it any easier to finish fourth at the end.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Credit: Margaret McLaughlinJohn BreslinFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailBarry’s Amusement Park could be open again as early as Easter, locals in Portrush are predicting — prompting delight that the lights may be switched back on at the iconic north coast landmark.Read MoreGalway firm rides in to save Barry’s Amusements in PortrushGenerations of families made a holiday pilgrimage to the north Antrim attraction’s dodgems, ghost train and rollercoasters before its sale in .A Galway-based park operator has now signed a lease with the owner of the site to manage the park, according to reports.An official announcement that the Curry family from Salthill has signed a lease with new owner, developer Michael Herbert, is expected this week, along with opening times, according to sources.The deal was first reported by Love Ballymena, which also shared video footage of the lights on the Big Dipper and the Wurlitzer last Thursday.A Curry’s Fun Park spokesperson told the online portal dates will be announced for the reopening soon. The company, which first expressed an interest in buying the park after it first went on the market in late , later told the Belfastit was unable to confirm or deny the reports, but added that a press release will be issued soon to clary all matters.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Locals are hearing the deal is done, said Willie Gregg, a charity worker and bartender at The Harbour bar.He added: “It can only be good but you do wonder how they think they can make it workthe other peopledecided to sell. But it is terrica new generation of kids will be able to experience the place.”The well-known Portrush personality believes “there is not a family on the island who has not been to Barry’s” but it is very dficult to put a price on how much it means to the local economy.While the numbers visiting Barry’s before it closed is not known, local business people say it is on a par with other famous attractions on the north coast. It is estimated its presence in the town brings in at least £m and up to £m every season, based on approximately , visitors.“You cannot put a price on Barry’s,” said Gregg.It emerged last year the . acre plot in the heart of the seaside town had been bought by the property developer, Michael Herbert.The Trufelli family, owners since its opening in , had expressed hope it would continue as an amusement park when they placed it on the market for £.m in November . Indeed, Curry’s had expressed an early interest, with owner Owen Curry saying at the time: “We would be the perfect contenders to take over Barry’s Amusements in Portrush.“We are a family-run business now in its fourth generation with specialist knowledge of how to run an amusement park and would certainly be a frontrunner in the purchasing of this type of business.”But in May last year it was revealed the site was being marketed as a development opportunity, raising fears it would never open as a park again.Mr Gregg added: “The date has to be announced but hopefully it is going to be by Easter. I would imagine it is a lot better being open, it will add a breath of fresh air again.”The park was recently used as a filming location for the third and final series of Derry Girls. This prompted Ian McElhinney, who plays Grandad, to remark they were the “last kids in the playground”. This may prove to be very premature, much to the delight of many.Most ReadSuzanne BreenOpinionWhat a fool Ian Paisley has been… century after Carson and in midst of their Brexit betrayal, the penny finally drops over Tory infidelityGalway firm rides in to save Barry’s Amusements in PortrushLoyalist caught with Belfast bookies massacre gun has Stormont-funded jobIan Paisley ‘took most freebies of all Northern Ireland MPs’… DUP veteran accepted tickets to Open and British Grand PrixPrince Andrew: Where the streets have no shame… Northern Ireland residents split over renaming places bearing his nameTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportPlayAssisi animal sanctuary ‘blown away’ by support after online dog fostering call following noise complaintLatest Northern IrelandDUP created Stormont crisis and wants to ‘dictate’ power-sharing terms, claims KearneyThe Thatch: Father and son weave their magic at Broughshane innLisa SmythOpinionRobin Swann left in unenviable position over Covid- restrictionsKate reads encouraging tale from childhood for CBeebies Bedtime StoriesUK set to be battered by high winds as Met Office warns of mph gusts next weekLatestLatest result expected in ‘Wagatha Christie’ caseTrial of trio accused of murdering five-year-old Logan Mwangi to startNHS race body finds ethnic inequalities across the health systemDr Dre leads crew of all star rappers at Super Bowl half time showTeam GB track and field star launches sportswear brand for unsigned athletes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The power-sharing Executive collapsed after Paul Givan was removed as first minister by his party in its ongoing protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol.If Article  is triggered, a Whitehall source said the DUP could renominate a first minister and go back into power-sharing before the May election.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up However, leader Jeffrey Donaldson — who warned the British government it had until February  to find a solution — said ing would depend on “the scope of the Article  action”.“It’s what triggering Article  actually leads to that is important,” said the Lagan Valley MP.It is understood discussions between DUP figures and the European Research Groupat Westminster in recent weeks also focused on unionist fears of a Sinn Féin first minister.“There is a strong view by some that to protect the Union you can’t have a nationalist first minister. They would argue it could lead to a greater chance of a Border poll,” said the Whitehall source. The ERG, which has  Conservative Euro-sceptic MPs among its membership and helped to dispose of Theresa May as prime minister in , is now piling on the pressure on the DUP’s behalf.“The ERG was mostly against the Chequers Agreement in  and the DUP was vital in going along with that. The fact is, it did not turn out as was intended,” said a Tory party source.“There is a feeling that there is a bit of a debt to the DUP to sort this out — they helped us and have ended up in a pretty bad situation.”Invoking the Brexit clause would allow the DUP to show unionists — and especially the loyalists who threatened violence over the protocol — that it had pushed the prime minister to act. “Donaldson had no option but to quit the Executive, given the haemorrhaging of support for the Assembly among unionists. Number  promised for months to act, and the cavalry never arrived,” said the source. “Something has got to happen before the Assembly election. Otherwise you are going to end up with a Sinn Féin first minister and power-sharing not ing.”Both the ERG and DUP have also warned Johnson of a perceived threat to power-sharing, saying a Michelle O’Neill-led government “would damage the union and Northern Ireland”.The Conservative source explained ERG members meet Johnson regularly, and added it “would be a mistake to think the prime minister needs persuading on triggering Article ”.He said Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis has spent the last few days in Washington “paving the wave for Article  and negotiation” by “stressing a dferent Good Friday Agreement interpretation”.A UK government spokesperson confirmed Mr Lewis had met with members of the US administration and Congress for discussions “including on the Northern Ireland Protocol”. “Our preference is to find a consensual solution to address the signicant issues on the ground. However, as we have said consistently, we will use the Article  safeguard mechanismsolutions cannot be found,” said the spokesperson. Read MoreBrandon Lewis says there is ‘landing ground’ for solving NI Protocol problemsKill protocol or the Union is finished, TUV chief tells rallyForeign Secretary Liz Truss will talk with Vice President Maros Sefcovic to continue these discussions.It is understood that in the past week, DUP figures have complained to Conservatives that DUP MPs turn up to take part in debates and “get nothing” — while Sinn Féin does not take its seats and “yet the government uses Westminster to give them what they want, like the Irish Language Act”.However, a bone of contention is the DUP’s regular meetings with the Loyalist Communities Council , which represents the Ulster Defence Association , Ulster Volunteer Forceand Red Hand Commando — including one meeting just hours before it decided to quit the Executive. Some loyalist paramilitaries have endorsed violence on the streets of Northern Ireland in the past two years, with a number of incidents causing disruption and harm. That’s why the DUP and ERG believe Article  is key, as it can be triggered in the event the protocol is causing “serious economic, societal or environmental dficulties.”“There is almost an incentive to create disturbances, because it was the threat of disturbances that created it in the first place,” said an ERG source.This assertion has been backed up by a member of the UVF, who believes loyalist violence has “made people realise the threats were serious”.“Everyone thought it was all a bit of a joke, and then loyalists threatened bombs going off in Limerick and burnt a few buses. No one in loyalism has forgotten the role Dublin played in talking up IRA violence. Someone recently remarked that a loud bang in Dublin is perhaps necessary to make them hear,” he said.Johnson’s premiership is hanging by a thread after he broke Covid regulations by attending several lockdown parties, but he knowshe wants to remain in office, he will have to appease those who oppose the protocol.The ERG source says it is now liaising with the DUP as a “force multiplier” at Westminster, with Tory whips indicating they would like to be able to work with its nine MPs because “you never know when they might be needed again and the prime minister knows this”.Last week in a rare move, ERG members attended debates on Northern Ireland in the House of Commons. It was an apparent move to firm up the DUP’s support, but there are claims some of its pro-Brexit Tory backbenchers are simply “weaponising” the Stormont crisis.“In Number , they are keen that the DUP has a good showing in the election. But they need to have some sort of win before the Assembly election,” the source said. “At the momentis scheduling legislation on the Irish Language Act, which is fairly innocuous and would be a win for Sinn Féin. “There has to be something to balance it out — and the protocol is the obvious thing.” Former Brexit Minister David Jones, the deputy chairman of the ERG, said he shares the DUP’s “concerns about the damage the protocol is doing to the Good Friday Agreement”.He said the protocol requires a “permanent resolution” and criticised past comments on the issue by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.“The Irish government needs to realise the immense ongoing damage being done to Northern Ireland and UK-Irish relations by the EU’s intransigence. The EU, Ireland and the UK need to sit down and discuss alternative ways to protect the EU’s single market,” Jones said.“If an agreement is not possible, then the UK will invoke Article  and legislate to remove the Irish Sea border, uphold the GFA and restore Northern Ireland’s equal position within the UK.”However, one Whitehall source said the plot by the ERG and the DUP “beggars belief”. “At a time of international crisis and need for a focus on the economic well-being of Northern Ireland’s citizens after the worst pandemic in recent history, it beggars belief that both the ERG and the DUP have been trying to take advantage of the PM’s weakened position, to avoid working on the compromises that are necessary.”Asked to explain the DUP’s relationship with the ERG, MLA Deborah Armstrong did not respond. Instead, she said her party has been “telling London, Dublin and Washington that the protocol is not supported by a single elected unionist”.“Progress is only made when deals have the support of unionists and nationalists.  “We will continue to make our case at Westminster and where — ultimately we will take that case to the people in the election.”Related topicsSir Jeffrey DonaldsonBoris JohnsonNI ProtocolMost ReadSuzanne BreenOpinionWhat a fool Ian Paisley has been… century after Carson and in midst of their Brexit betrayal, the penny finally drops over Tory infidelityGalway firm rides in to save Barry’s Amusements in PortrushLoyalist caught with Belfast bookies massacre gun has Stormont-funded jobIan Paisley ‘took most freebies of all Northern Ireland MPs’… DUP veteran accepted tickets to Open and British Grand PrixPrince Andrew: Where the streets have no shame… Northern Ireland residents split over renaming places bearing his nameTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportPlayAssisi animal sanctuary ‘blown away’ by support after online dog fostering call following noise complaintLatest Northern IrelandDUP created Stormont crisis and wants to ‘dictate’ power-sharing terms, claims KearneyThe Thatch: Father and son weave their magic at Broughshane innBarry’s Amusements could be open for business again by EasterLisa SmythOpinionRobin Swann left in unenviable position over Covid- restrictionsKate reads encouraging tale from childhood for CBeebies Bedtime StoriesLatestLatest result expected in ‘Wagatha Christie’ caseTrial of trio accused of murdering five-year-old Logan Mwangi to startNHS race body finds ethnic inequalities across the health systemDr Dre leads crew of all star rappers at Super Bowl half time showTeam GB track and field star launches sportswear brand for unsigned athletes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart. In the entire Gospel. St Joseph speaks only two words. Sometimes we speak too many words and we lose orientation and get confused. Only one word is important ndash the Word of God ndash we should listen to the Word of God. St Patrick listened to the Word of God.Speaking afterwards of his visit, Archbishop Okolo said: ldquoIt was indeed nice and uplting, praying together on that holy ground, on which St Patrick trod.Next week, the All Ireland Novena journeys to Slane where St Patrick lit the Paschal fire.The Novena can be watched online at pm via the parish webcam..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9Feburary2020_Panto.jpg","title":"Children on stage for The Wizard of Oz show  ","story":"THE abundance of musical and dramatic talent at the Patrician Youth Centre in Downpatrick is back on show for the first time in almost two years.A young and enthusiastic cast presented the pantomime, The Wizard of Oz, last week.Performing Arts and live productions at the Patrician paused in March  with the onset of Covid- and ensuing pandemic.Determined to get going again, staff and members worked on Tom Whalleyrsquos new pantomime production of the very popular musical The Wizard of Oz.Despite many ongoing Covid disruptions were delighted to have a performance which was live streamed last week.Unfortunately, in the lead-up to the event some of the principal cast members were Covid isolating.On the day before the performance leading lady Shona Gardiner, who was to play Dorothy, tested positive.In true showbiz tradition, the show had to go on and a telephone call from a former Patrician member saved the day.Mairead OrsquoHare, who played Dorothy in the Patricianrsquos  production of the Wizard of Oz, volunteered to stand in to read the role and sing the ever-popular songs. Mairead ed and performed like she never had been away.Senior youth worker Yvonne Maguire congratulated everyone connected with the production mdash the cast members, production team, friends of Patrician, parents, and families for supporting members, children and young people.She extended a sincere thank you to Mairead for standing in at the last minute and also paid tribute to Shona, who had worked so hard in preparing for the performance and regrettably did not get the opportunity to star.A recording of Shona singing will be available on Facebook.The principal cast members were: Mairead OrsquoHare , Aaron Mullan , Aedan OrsquoHare , Annie May OrsquoHare , Eamon OrsquoHare , Eva Bailie , Tyler Fung , Zoe Gaines .Chorus, dancers, monkeys, trees and crows: Caitie Cunlfe, Caragh Moore, Conal McDowell, Ella Grace Cunlfe, Emily Douglas, Georgia Savage, Jack McDonald, Katie Fegan, Kayleigh Rogers, Lilly Boyd, Maria Rooney, Megan Megahey, Molly Boyd, Molly Madine, Oisin OrsquoHare, Poppy Baggley, Poppy Woodall.Patrician Youth Centre would also like to thank the following staff team and friends for making the production possible: Caitriona Smyth, Anthony Frew, Bridin Wells, Eamonn Hanlon, Charlie Hanlon, David McBennett, Melissa Poland, Paddy Watters, Mark Hassett, Anna Murray and Teresa Sweeney.Thanks are also extended other team members and the centre trainee leader membership who supported the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Sea.jpg","title":"Drive for better sea swimming facilities  ","story":"A SERIES of measures to improve the safety of sea swimmers in Newcastle have been suggested to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority has been asked to address the needs of the increasing numbers who enjoy swimming at the resortrsquos harbour.Council officials met recently with Mournes councillor Laura Devlin who is working to secure improved access to the water and the needs of those who enjoy cold water swimming.Cllr Devlin said while sea swimming has always been popular in the resort, there is an increasing number of people taking to the water as a result of Covid which prompted many people across the district to be more active.She said Newcastlersquos Harbour Heritage Association is bringing many people who use services at the harbour together to provide them with a ldquounied voice with the group including representatives of the sea swimming community.ldquoCold water therapy is now an established activity and the coronavirus pandemic will unfortunately have a lasting impact on mental health, continued Cllr Devlin.ldquoThis type of therapy is seen as a successful line of defence and even treatment for many, notwithstanding the superb physical benefits and enjoyment that cold water swimming brings.Cllr Devlin says there are many activities at Newcastle harbour which can sometimes lead to a congested slipway, explaining that there are ldquosignicant safety concerns when swimmers, boats and jet-skis are in the water at once.The local councillor, who met recently with council officials and was joined by local sea swimmer Fiona Davey, has also highlighted parking problems at the harbour which she said are ldquocontinuing to deteriorate.She continued: ldquoI have also consulted with The Harbour Heritage Association and we agreed a list of issues that need to be addressed which the local authority which is considering improvements to the water access point on the harbour side of the Rock Pool or at the Back Shore.ldquoAn extension of the ramp leading to the water is also required to allow for disability access, while a handrail to assist people entering and exiting the water as well as hooks for clothes and storage, and a seating area for changing is also required.Council officials have also been asked to provide buoys near the pier to section off the area for those jumping into the water and sea swimming in general.Cllr Devlin also highlighted the need for height markers on the pier wall in order that those who jump into the water will know the depth, explaining the water depth can be an issue during the summer months.Council officials have also been asked to provide distance markers, so swimmers know how far out they are.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThis is a flavour of our asks and really is just a starting point. I donrsquot see any of the issues that have been highlighted as costing a signicant amount. If they can be implemented, they would make a tangible dference to harbour users. I hope that progress can be made soon for the good of all harbour users.Thanking Cllr Devlin for her work to improve safety for sea swimmers at the harbour, South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he looked forward to ldquomuch-needed changes in Newcastle.He also believes that the series of measures outlined for the harbour could be used as a template by the local authority for open water swimming and cold water therapy across the district.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are fortunate to be surrounded by such beautul coastline which has many locations for accessing the water, but itrsquos vital that we make the activity as safe as possible in a select number of locations that ensure an equitable offering across the council area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 12th%2C 1992  ","story":"ARDGLASS ndash The fishing fleet in Ardglass is facing a potential crisis following a slump in the crucially-important prawn market.Demand for prawns has ped dramatically because of the recession, resulting in depressed prices and trawler men struggling to meet running costs.Yesterday, fishermenrsquos leader Dick James said: ldquoWe are not yet in a crisis, but one is fast developing.Mr James, who is chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, has called on the Government to introduce a decommissioning scheme which would enable trawler owners to leave the industry.ldquoA decommissioning scheme would go a long way towards solving the problem. At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure. The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment. At long last we are to get these light, he said.After meeting Roads Service officials, Mr Biggerstaff also announced progress on a number of other projects in the Saintfield area.He said the provision of a footpath along Middle Road is to go forward to the Departmentrsquos forward planning section, as well similar provision on the Ballynahinch Road, Saintfield, as far as Ballymaconnell Road.Mr Biggerstaff said he had also been assured that a footpath extension from Lislane Park to the new build on the Listooder Road, taking in the primary school area will ldquodefinitely happen this year.The Ulster Unionist councillor has also asked officials to carry out a study into a serious flooding problem during periods of heavy rain at Carsonstown Road Killybawn Road.NEWCASTLE ndash Down councillor, Mr John Ritchie, has claimed that the Eastern Health Board consultation process is the ldquokiss of death for Mourne House.In a strong address to the Eastern Health Council attacking the closer plan for Mourne House, Mr Ritchie said that in his experience consultation rarely results in a change to such a proposal.Mr Ritchie claimed the unit of management has looked at the Mourne House scenario from a narrow perspective and he voiced concern about the future of the elderly people in the outlying parts of the community.It was the local councillor who asked for the Mourne House issue to be put on the Council agenda for Thursdayrsquos meeting and he dominated the  minute discussion.During his address Mr Ritchie suggested the implementation of a two-year programme to deal with the renovations and the building could then be used as a base for a community care programme.Mr Ritchie explained that Mourne House first came to light in the dying days of the last Eastern Health Board when the policy and planning committee considered a plan for the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management.The proposal included reducing the number of beds to  and developing Mourne House as a base for a community care package with respite care, a  place day centre, and meals on wheels.Mr Ritchie said there were a whole range of suggestions which the Board felt made a ldquovery attraction option.CLOUGH ndash The Presbyterian congregation in Clough held a thanksgiving service on Sunday to bid farewell to their  year-old church hall which is being replaced.The hall which was built in , is being demolished to make way for a new hall which will be officially opened by the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, the Rev Rodney Sterritt, in April.The services was conducted by the Rev Robert Craig, church minister, who researched the origins and construction of the hall at the turn of the century.The hymn, psalm and ure reading were the same as those used at the opening service.The ious organisations which used the hall over the years were remembered, including the Scouts and Guides, Boysrsquo and Girlsrsquo Brigades, the Girlsrsquo auxiliary, and the badminton, bowls and table tennis clubs.The congregation also remembered the many services and church socials which were held in the hall.In his address, Mr Craig pointed to the strong links between the current congregation and that of a bygone age.He said many of the original families still reside in the Clough area and belong to the congregation.Mr Craig said the congregation is still industrious and is currently busy erecting and paying for the new hall.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league. We work hard every Tuesday and Thursday night and itrsquos a credit to our manager, Michael Carvill, for the shape hersquos pulled us in to.Kilmore: C Turley, J McCarthy, M Stewart, J Larkin, G Kennedy, B Walsh, J Smyth, N McCarthy , J McKinney, A McGrattan, E McGrattan.Subs: C Magee, M Monan, M Carvill.Yellow cards: C Magee, A McGrattan, J McKinney.Comber: A Topping, M Gibson, L Walker, B Porter, R Whittle, S Moore, B Nelson, S Hanna , D Wilson, M Tumilson, G Keenan.Subs: S Fleck, C Gillan, K Gaw.Yellow cards: S Moore, C Gillan, B Porter, S Hanna..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Knockevin in £75k funding initiative  ","story":"KNOCKEVIN Special Schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association has unveiled details of an ambitious pound, fundraising initiative.The school has bases in Downpatrick, Dundrum and Castlewellan, with the parent and staff group hoping that the ldquoenchantment project will raise vital funds to purchase essential outdoor play and learning equipment.In addition, some of the pound, will be used to meet school bus running costs and other essential items at Knockevinrsquos three bases.Announcing details of the new fundraising initiative, the parent and staff group said pupils are in need of ious items to help combat social deprivation as a result of the ongoing pandemic.ldquoOur children may not always have the same opportunity for social inclusion as those in mainstream education, but to be able to provide them with an outdoor space they can safely and comfortably enjoy together which is fully accessible and tailored to all their needs would be a dream come true, said a spokesperson for the group.ldquoOur children and young adults are most deserving of this. and, as with all specialist equipment, a large price tag is included and we aim to hold as many fundraising activities and events as possible to ensure that we reach our goal.As Covid restrictions continue to ease, the highly acclaimed special school will be able to hold its th anniversary at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel on September , with entertainment provided by the Booze Bros and Finbarr Keaveney the compere for the evening.ldquoWe are looking forward to getting together again to celebrate all that has been achieved in the past  years.

However, by pm the taped route was ready, the registration was complete and the nervous but excited youngsters were warming up in anticipation.Primary Four and under lined up, first the boys and then the girls. With vests down to their knees and a few anxious glances to parents, it seemed that they were almost too young for such a task but once the whistle blew they set off like rockets round the m circuit.Harry McVeigh, for Newcastle AC, was the clear winner in the boysrsquo race and Aoe Maguireheld a five second lead to win the girlsrsquo race.Primary Five saw the girls and boys combined in the one race and the winners were John McElroyand Emily Kerr . The  metres didnrsquot seem a bother to either of these young athletes.Ryan Thorntonwent off hard for the P win and Saorlaith McAleenanwas the epitome of focus as she headed to the line to come first in the P girls.With  entrants and the distance now one kilometre, it was a challenging race.The P looked an experienced bunch as they gathered at the start.Many have been racing each other in the Flahavanrsquos XC Series for schools so there were scores to be settled. Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things. The distance for year eight was m and Erin Easton , who won the girlsrsquo race by eight seconds, looked controlled throughout. Aaron OrsquoBoylehad an exciting sprint to the line to snatch glory in Year Eight boys.Emma Stewartcovered the m Year Nine girlsrsquo race at great speed to place first girl and Alex Robinson seemed to revel in the extra running as the gap between him and the second runner stretched out as the race proceeded.Year Ten boys and girls ran together as there were  when combined.The m race allowed spectators to get multiple glimpses as the they looped round the field.Aaron Lennonwon his race comfortably and Edana Butterfieldhad a similar outcome in the girlsrsquo category.The finale was Year  and up. This had a mix of gender as well as year groups.

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line. I challenged the guys at half-time and there was a big improvement in the first twenty minutes of the second half.ldquoGalway hit us on the break and they went and got a couple of late scores to put a bit of gloss on it.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February . In other games at home last week, Down High third XV bowed out of their plate competition at the quarter-final stage with a narrow - loss to Campbell College fourth XV in what was an entertaining fixture, while a select U-  team defeated Wellington College -.The other plaudits of the weekend went to the U- A team, who produced a captivating performance to defeat RBAI - on Saturday morning.The U- B and Cs, also playing RBAI, lost but put in some proud performances demonstrating the impressive depth in this squad..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13471704.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The spectre of Powellism.By Henry McDonaldSunday, th February , : pm  \"       \"  Enoch Powell with a young Jeffrey Donaldson in  when the current DUP leader was acting as Powell’s election agentAlthough Enoch Powell has been dead for just under a quarter of a century the former South Down MP it seems is disturbing the dreams of the ’ chief commentator this weekend.In his latest outburst of post-Brexit unionist-bashing O’Toole suggests that what is really animating the current leading figure in unionism, Jeffrey Donaldson, is the spirit of Powell.To be fair the Democratic Unionist leader is a le-long admirer of the man his predecessor Dr Ian Paisley once dismissed contemptuously as “the Wolverhampton Wanderer”.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.When Sir Jeffrey was still in the rival Ulster Unionist Party Enoch Powell was one of his heroes. Which was ill judged given that Powell’s old style, outdated colonialist outlook was never going to be a good advertisement for unionism in any form, and certainly not in the st century.Nonetheless, to suggest that Powell is animating the current position of the DUP and indeed all the major unionist parties is an absurd exaggeration. O’Toole caricatures their opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol as akin to being on a ghost train driven by Powell. He clearly needs to get out more especially up in Northern Ireland where he should engage with the voters that support those parties.Whether you are unionist, nationalist or neither it might be a good idea to open a dialogue with the people you are excoriating rather than telling us it was all Enoch Powell’s fault.With the noble exception of Stephen Collins’ intrinsically sensible columns, this type of commentary typies the dismissive, patronising and ill-informed analysis you tend to get about Northern Ireland these days from the Republic’s paper of record. To suggest that Enoch Powell exercises any real influence over current unionist political thinking is itself a throwback to dferent days. Powell’s dismal vision of a UK torn apart by racial isions has been by and large proved wholly wrong. The country is a far more tolerant and open society than it was when Powell made his hysterical ‘Rivers of Blood’ prophecy at the end of the s. The UK’s strength today lies pace Powell in its ethnic and racial ersity, a quality that all the advocates of the Union should be advancing and hailing.It is also outrageous that O’Toole fails to mention the impact of the IRA’s violent campaign on Jeffrey Donaldson’s background and thinking. The DUP MP’s uncle Samuel was one of the first RUC officers murdered by the Provisionals at the start of the Troubles. Throughout three decades of sectarian conflict Donaldson attended many funerals of his constituents, friends and wider family circle who were targeted in that violence. Again, you can be unionist, nationalist or neither or indeed either pro or anti EU but surely no one should ignore the immense and dark influence of those murders and trauma on the development of a politician’s career.O’Toole also references Ted Heath for sacking Powell from the Tory cabinet over his infamous speech. The irony is that Heath presided over policies in Northern Ireland that had disastrous consequences for Northern Ireland. It was Heath not Powell who pushed for the catastrophic decision to impose internment in Northern Ireland. And it was Heath’s government that sent the Parachute Regiment into Londonderry in  leading to the Bloody Sunday massacre. Heath’s legacy, not Powell’s, is the one that haunts this society to this day.As for Brexit O’Toole tries in his column to bequeath the UK leaving the EU to the legacy of Enoch Powell. He forgets that the European Union or what was then the EEC also had its critics from the left as well as the right. One of the most outspoken Eurosceptics on the British political landscape for decades was also one of the strongest advocates for a united Ireland in the House of Commons.

Many of the myths that were established over the five or six years since the referendum have been repeated.By Owen PolleySaturday, th February , : am  \"       \"  An anti-Brexit mock-up of Theresa May steering the good ship Brexit into an iceberg outside the Palace of Westminster Owen Polley argues that many people have misunderstood the reality of Mrs May’s Brexit dealLet’s look at some of the most popular and persistent.First, many people claimed again that an Irish Sea border became inevitable when the UK decided to leave the EU. They said that the protocol is the fault of Brexit supporters, including unionistswho voted for it. Pro-Union leavers should therefore ‘own’ the consequences of their decision and stop complaining.One problem with this logic is that the Republic’s government, under the then-taoiseach Enda Kenny, did not think that a sea border was inevitable in the months following the referendum.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.In fact, Dublin officials began exploring how checks could take place on the land frontier between Northern Ireland and the south.They assumed, quite logically, that any hardening of the border would have to reflect an existing international boundary that had been established for over a century. It is the fact that this did not happen that is extraordinary and unprecedented.More importantly, from a political and moral perspective, unionists had every right to campaign for Brexit, without fear that Northern Ireland would subsequently be wrenched out of important aspects of the Union. Their place in the United Kingdom relies on the ‘principle of consent’, which is supposed to be a central tenet of the Belfast Agreement. Andthat principle means anything at all, voters in Northern Ireland would expect to take part in a nationwide referendum and have its outcome applied here on the same terms as voters where in the UK. You can understand why nationalist parties, that have never convincingly accepted that the principle of consent has consequences, would not grasp this argument. It is more disturbing when some self-declared unionists seem to share their outlook.During the EU referendum, pro-Union people took part in both the ‘remain’ and ‘leave’ campaigns. Afterwards, perfectly reasonably, they took dferent views about what kind of Brexit the UK should pursue.The one point of consensus should have been that any outcome must be UK wide and include Northern Ireland fully.Another piece of received wisdom, repeated constantly, is that the DUP insisted on a ‘hard Brexit’ and rejected every proposal that would have resulted in a ‘softer’ outcome.This is connected to the even more inaccurate claim that Theresa May’s ‘backstop’ deal would have prevented economic barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Admittedly, the DUP’s performance, in the wake of , has been distinctly unimpressive. It spurned the chance to play a constructive role in the UK government after the  election, preferring to boast that it had secured £ billion in funding. It endorsed the ‘joint report’ of December  that entrenched Theresa May’s ‘backstop’, after initially insisting on ineffective changes.And it eventually agreed to a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, before Boris Johnson signed his protocol.However, despite the impression given by MPs like Ian Paisley and Sammy Wilson, the DUP did not insist on a ‘hard Brexit’. The party’s only ‘red line’ was that any deal should treat Northern Ireland the same as the rest of the UK.Its Westminster leader at the time, Nigel Dodds, told the BBC’s Newsnight programme that, given a choice between protecting the Union and delivering Brexit, the DUP would choose the Union.The party rejected Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement because it treated Northern Ireland dferently. Yes, the former prime minister’s aim was to keep the whole UK tied closely to the EU’s single market and customs union which, in the short term, may have prevented disruption to GB-NI trade.But the whole point of the ‘backstop’ was thatthe rest of the UK erged from Brussels’ rules, Northern Ireland would remain tied to the single market and customs union. May was committed to a close relationship with the EU, but her government was hanging by a thread.Her agreement was likely to create every problem subsequently entrenched by the Protocol, as soon as a more eurosceptic administration took power in Westminster.In addition, it removed Northern Ireland officially from the UK’s customs regime and tied it to the EU set-up instead. For the casual observer, a lot of this detail was easy to miss. Consistently, the Westminster government played down problems involved in the withdrawal agreements championed first by Theresa May and then by Boris Johnson. It’s understandable that the DUP’s opponents, and particularly its unionist rivals, want to point out the party’s failures.On the pro-Union side, though, they should be careful to ensure that their criticisms are well-aimed and accurate.There is every danger that, otherwise, they might end up strengthening profoundly anti-unionist arguments and bolstering the position of those who are using Brexit as an excuse to weaken the Union.– Ben Lowry s next weekMore from the News Letter: WATCH – Bid to intimidate ‘orange scum’ out of mixed housing estate fails Click here – RUC ‘collusive’ findings: WATCH as DUP man denounces IRA while speaker Alex Maskey tries to rein him in for ‘going off-topic’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

To make that decision, the secretary of state needs to knowit is likely that a majority would vote in favour of a united Ireland.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Despite surveys of attitude about the topic and ious polls of likely voting intention, there is an absence of definitive data. However, there is a straightforward way to gather the accurate information required to guide the secretary of state. That is to hold an ‘indicative’vote on the subject. The vote could be undertaken as part of one of our regular elections . A small change to current voting legislation might be required to facilitate the vote. Voters would be presented with a separate voting paper containing the two options — remain in the UK, or join a united Ireland. Some people believe that we should not discuss this matter because it is a ‘isive’ issue. Unfortunately, almost every political issue in Northern Ireland is isive, so this should not be a block on seeking conclusive information. The indicative vote is likely to have the side effect of increasing turnout in the election with which it is held. Higher turnouts are usually considered a good thing in a healthy democracy. It is possible that the higher turnout might disproportionately favour unionist parties in terms of seats won. It is also worth noting that British MPs at Westminster used a system of indicative votes in March  when debating the isive issue of Brexit. If the indicative vote in favour of a united Ireland was  per cent or lower, then the issue could be put to bed for seven years. If the vote for a united Ireland was  per cent or higher, then the secretary of state might wish to prepare the groundfor a full, binding referendum within two years. There would be a marginal additional cost in printing the indicative voting papers and counting the votes cast, but at least everyone would know precisely where we stood.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBute Cottage Nursery is set to merge with Evenlode Primary under Vale of Glamorgan council plans opposed by hundreds.The council’s cabinet was urged to rethink the merger, with some councillors claiming not enough attention was given to a public consultation where most people opposed the plan.Cllr George Carroll, leader of the Conservative group on the Vale council, called in the merger decision to be looked at by the learning and culture scrutiny committee.He said: “That’s a clear and signicant majority of consultees who were opposed to this proposal. Insufficient consideration was made regarding those consultations responses.”The scrutiny committee, which met on Thursday, February , also heard from parents, governors and trade union representatives about their concerns over the merger.Richard Disley, chair of governors at Bute Cottage, said: “It’s been dficult to get our voices heard during this process. Our concerns have always been about the wellbeing of our staff. If the amalgamation happens, the current positions of the majority of nursery staff are only guaranteed for  months.“Long-serving permanent staff members who are in our current budget have job stability, will now only have guaranteed work for  months. Staff haven’t been offered any support from the local authority during this very stressful time.“Bute Cottage should be held up as an example of how things should be done, not merged into a primary school with the sole purpose of fitting into a – year model, for which there is no proof of improved outcomes for children. We have asked for evidence on a number of occasions but none has been forthcoming.”Kate Rees, a parent whose children went to Bute Cottage, said: “It was disappointing that there wasn’t more consideration for the issues we raised. Bute Cottage has its own headteacher, budget, governing body, and specialist staff. Those are the magic ingredients that come together to create the exceptional setting for education..remove“I have three children. All three of them were lucky enough to go to Bute Cottage, and they all attend Evenlode now, and Bute Cottage was just a really wonderful experience for them. I got to know that nursery really well. Because of that I’m absolutely passionate about the provision there.”Concerns over the merger include the possible relocation of the nursery to the Evenlode Primary School site, although this would be several years away and only a potential move and a change in the teaching style. The Vale council has said the merger would help provide continuity and stability for pupils to attend the same school from three to eleven years.Cllr Rhiannon Birch said the concerns were overblown and “disappointing”, and added high teaching standards would be kept after the merger.She said: “They will have the same staff, there will be the same guiding ethos, there will be the same standards of professionalism. To hear some of these speakers, you would think these children are going to be put in a field to poke each other with sticks, rather than having an education.“It’s very disappointing their lack of trust in teaching professionals who will continue to maintain high standards, to provide pastoral care, education and all the dferent aspects of nursery education. It seems to me incredible to believe that all of this should be going out of the window simply because we’re talking about the governing body.”Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said no changes to staff will be made as part of the merger, which would be restricted to how the school and nursery are governed.She said: “A consultation is not a referendum. It’s where we listen to views to see whether there’s any reason why the agreed policy … should not be applied. The nurseries would only be merged at a governance and leadership level, and there would be no change to where they’re operating. Those nurseries are not moving.“There will be no change to staffing or surroundings. There’s no reason to think that anything in terms of teaching and standards of learning in these schools will be altered in any way at all.”Asked about a potential future feasibility study into relocating the nursery next to Evenlode, she said: “Because you would want to see whether you have the best model, and whether it would be betterit were on one site. I’m on record as saying I don’t think it would be feasible.“But there were comments of people who don’t have cars, who live in the Evenlode catchment area, and actually walk from lower Penarth up to the nursery every day and back.“So you have to do a feasibility [study], to see whether or not that would work. But there is such a workload on the st Century Schools team, that unless it was prioritised, it would be a number of years before we could even look at it with the amount of other work.”If approved, the merger of the nursery and the primary school would take effect in September this year. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCardf International Business Park would be built on farmland east of Cardf Airport in the Vale of Glamorgan.But the plans have attracted heavy criticism from campaigners and politicians fearing the impact on the environment of “concreting over” a working farm.Now Legal and General, the developer behind the scheme, has said the business park would create , jobs and attract £ million investment, boosting the local economy.Andrew McPhillips, Legal and General’s development director of strategic land and major projects, said: “This is a key project for Wales and we know it is important that we continue to communicate our plans to key stakeholders, the community and future partners.“Wales must be open for business for those who want to invest and consider investment in its future global economic development. The land has been allocated for planning within the enterprise zone for a number of years.”As well as building the -hectare business park, the plans involve giving  hectares of farmland to Vale of Glamorgan council, to massively extend the neighbouring Porthkerry Country Park. A corridor of land along Porthkerry Road would also be kept safeguarded, connecting the nearby railway line with Cardf Airport for a potential new train or tram service there.Mr McPhillips said: “We have already agreed the transfer of  hectares of land to the Vale of Glamorgan Council to form an extension to Porthkerry Country Park, for use by the community with added funding for environmental management.“This transfer will provide more public access with connection to the Wales Coastal Path, and access on foot from Porthkerry and Rhoose. From an environmental perspective, this transfer goes beyond mitigation and provides signicant bioersity net gain. There would also be . hectares of green space within the business park.”.removeThe business park would be built on Model Farm, off Port Road, which has been farmed by the Jenkins family for four generations. The family previously said they were “devastated” that they would have to leave the farm, but are hoping to continue their wildflower seed business.Legal and General bought the farm several years ago, and it was earmarked for a major building project in , as part of Vale of Glamorgan council’s local development plan. The site is also in one of eight enterprise zones in Wales, where the Welsh Government is focusing economic development and encouraging businesses to invest.Last summer the Vale council’s planning committee voted to grant permission for the business park at Model Farm. Campaigners then successfully applied for a judicial review, leading to the permission getting quashed. Now, another planning application has been sent to the council, and a public consultation on the plans is running until February .Then in the next few months, councillors on the planning committee will again be asked to vote on whether to approve permission for the business park. The last vote was split along party lines, with nine councillors voting in favour and eight against. With the upcoming local election in May, the political makeup of the committee could change, affecting the next vote.But in the meantime, Legal and General has released new estimates of how Cardf International Business Park could boost the local economy. With overall floorspace of the development covering , square metres, it’s expected the business park could provide space for , full-time employees.Gross value added, which measures local economic output, is expected to be a total of £ million, comprising £ million when the business park is operational and £ million during construction. Building the business park is expected to last a decade, creating  jobs.However, Maxine Levett, a campaigner with Vale Communities Unite, said several questions regarding the plans remain unanswered. She added the business park would be “detrimental” to the community and environment, and was unnecessary with several vacant brownfield sites nearby.She said: “This is a working farm helping feed the community and encouraging bioersity, when the Vale council has declared a climate emergency. The current land available at the Bro St Athans site shows there isn’t a requirement for this type of development, as there are thousands of square metres of brownfield sites waiting to be scooped up.“Who will finance the road works to accommodate the impact of potentially , extra vehicles from this site, on top of additional transport needs from recent residential buildings and the proposed development of Aberthaw power station “Bristol Airport has declared they are increasing their passengers to  million a year. This will greatly impact companies willing to fly out of Cardf Airport. And where is the funding coming from to provide a rail link to a planned transport hub “We will continue to fight this development as we feel it to be detrimental to the community, environment and unnecessary with Aberthaw, St Athan and other locations near to the M corridor better placed to meet employment needs, rather than a working farm.”Contrary to the views of campaigners and some local politicians, Legal and General has claimed it would preserve and enhance the environment. Plans include three kilometres of new hedgerows, and planting five acres of scrub and woodland, as well as extending Porthkerry Country Park.Mr McPhillips said: “Legal and General has been committed to Wales as a progressive investor and substantial employer for many years. This is a project which will increase economic growth and we will continue to pursue the planning viability sensitively with existing stakeholders.“Creating , jobs and investment of £ million must be seen as essential for the future of the Welsh economy, especially next to Cardf Airport. This investment in business infrastructure by Legal and General enhances the Welsh Government’s current major investment in Cardf Airport, a strategic gateway to facilitate international connectivity.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Eoghan Rua is a big part of le in Coleraine and this money will go towards improving their current facilities with work set to get underway in the summer. “Eoghan Rua has members from right across the North Coast and is a real hub of our GAA community. This funding will allow them to build on the good work already ongoing at the club and allow them to grow and develop in the coming years.“I have visited Eoghan Rua myself and met with club officials and seen first-hand the good work the club does both on the pitch and in the community. It’s a club that is constantly giving back to people in this area and it’s important that we support them, particularly now with renewed opportunities for sport as we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic.”Read More Read MoreGAA friends raise £k in memory of SmickoCara HunterCauseway Coast  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularMagherafelt man exposed himself to female neighbour...NewsPolice appeal for help to find missing Ethan Smith...NewsNorthern Ireland yellow weather warning for wind...NewsFallen tree now cleared from road...NewsHealth Minister Robin Swann tests positive for Covid-...NewsMost PopularBest dehumidiers UK: keep your home warm and dry through w...RecommendedHow to choose a dining table, and our favourite dining table...RecommendedValentine’s Day meals: the best supermarket meal deals UK ...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
