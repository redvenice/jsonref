She was in her element – her dress speaks to her sense of cultural pride’Her name is Joy and I photographed her outside one of the many African churches in south-east London. I had just finished photographing a mosque on the same bland industrial estate when I found the blue wall, then spotted Joy dancing in the church with her children. I thought: “That’s a portrait I’ve got to get,” and asked if she’d come outside and have her photograph taken.Her dress speaks to her sense of cultural pride. She’s in her element, in church, in a place where she can showcase her Nigerian clothes. When you put that across in the isive time in which we’re living, it paints a positive story about her identity as a Londoner, especially when you consider the wider context. Six countries in Europe have banned the burqa (16 worldwide) and Quebec has banned all religious symbols, but London has created spaces for people to celebrate their cultural heritage, and that’s special.Joy’s church is Christ’s Chosen Church of God. It’s one of several black-majority churches in streets where old warehouses are being used for Sunday worship. The services contrast with the mundane exteriors: worshipping God among the Nigerian community is a very celebratory experience. Outfits such as Joy’s are commonplace, and a good amount of the service is spent dancing and singing. I think that’s why so few people I approached for this project said no to being photographed – they are happy to do it when they feel good about themselves.I photographed Joy in August 2019, towards the end of a three-year project I called Sunday Best, which celebrates London’s religious ersity through portraits and stories of Londoners dressed for worship. My first idea was to photograph African churches in my area of south London, because the black teens in their Sunday best look so different from the negative stereotypes about hoodie culture. The project was shaped and expanded by events that unfolded thereafter.In June 2016, there was the Brexit vote, then the terrorist attacks in London in June 2017, which came just after I had a baby. I started to feel very pessimistic about bringing a child up in Britain, but after the Grenfell Tower fire I read all these tweets from people from other countries saying how much they admired the way the British – of all religions and races – pulled together in times of crisis. The lens through which other countries saw us seemed much more empathetic than how we view ourselves, and that made me want to reinforce a more positive vision of what it means to British.I chose to look at multiculturalism through religion because it’s so attached to national and cultural identity, and I sought out places of worship that served particular communities rather than particular denominations. The response I got came as a surprise, people saying: “We are British, and part of being British is being able to celebrate who we are. You don’t get this anywhere else in the world.” Such experiences built a celebratory and optimistic foundation for the project, amid a sombre national mood.As I went into the various places of worship, I became very aware of my own cultural misconceptions. I’m not religious, and I think that people like me sometimes think of religion in terms of ill-informed assumptions and problems. Take Islam. There are very narrow representations of Muslims in the media, but it’s a religion of 1.8 billion people. It can’t be represented by a few stereotypes. There’s a culture of fear based on a simple lack of understanding and knowledge that then breeds separatism and mistrust. But what religion brings to people’s lives in terms of a sense of belonging, companionship and community far outweighs the negatives. The religious people I spoke with talked about prayer and how much it helps with mental health.The religious ersity of London – and other cities such as Leicester, Manchester or Birmingham – should be celebrated. There are many different ways of telling stories of Britishness, but it’s the isive ones that are predominating at the moment. Instead of submitting to negative depictions, I want to use photography to show the best of who we are. • Sunday Best by Katie Waggett is published by Hoxton Mini Press.Training: BA graphic arts and design at Leeds politan University, and MA photojournalism and documentary photography at London College of Communication.Influences: Diane Arbus, Liz Hingley, Vanessa Winship, and my mother, Jackie Waggett, who was a painter and printmaker.High point: ‘Every time I come back with a portrait I’m proud of.’Low point: ‘Someone I adored died last year, and the way I found out destroyed me.

US stocks are heading lower, mirroring European declines.Wall Street is set to open lower in 20 minutes, as fears of a second Covid-19 wave persist, and weekly US jobless claims came in higher than expected at 1.508m, suggesting a second wave of layoffs after the initial round sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking to Reuters, Steven Blitz, chief US economist at research firm TS Lombard in New York, says about the latest weekly jobless claims figure:People will say claims are coming down, but for an economy that is reopening, that is a huge number. The economy is losing workers and employment beyond the initial impact tied to businesses that shut down. There are a lot of industries that are getting hurt and that’s starting to cascade down, that is what those numbers are showing.And Holger Zschäpitz, senior editor at the economic and financial desk of the German daily Die Welt and its Sunday edition, has tweeted: The head of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, delivered a cautious message earlier this week when he testified before the Senate and the House financial services committee. He said that “significant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery”. Looks like his caution was justified...US weekly jobless claims remained high last week, as the coronavirus crisis sparked a second wave of layoffs. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits in the US totalled 1.508 million in the week to 13 June, compared with 1.566 million in the previous week, the US Labor Department said. The number was higher than the 1.3 million expected by economists. Weekly jobless claims have fallen from the record 6.867m recorded in late March, but remain high, even after the Covid-19 lockdown was eased. They contrast with the 2.5m extra workers employers hired in May, which triggered hopes of a swift economic recovery.James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, sums up the situation neatly:The Bank of England has expanded its QE programme, but more importantly, the calmer rate market conditions have given policymakers enough confidence to slow the pace of purchases. Still, the myriad of risks facing the economy suggests that the Bank could come under further pressure to do more - and that will undoubtedly fuel discussion of negative rates.Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, has looked at the slower pace of bond-buying:This extra £100bn of QE (all gilts, not corporate bonds) comes on top of the £200bn announced in mid-March. And as the MPC said it expects to complete these extra purchases around the turn of the year, that implies a much slower rate of purchases of about £4bn a week down from the recent rate of about £13.5bn a week. Here is our full story on the Bank of England:What’s the outlook for Britain’s savers?The flood of people saving money in lockdown together with record low Base Rate means finding a decent savings rate is like trying to find loo roll at the start of the crisis – pretty tricky.Marcus by Goldman Sachs, which has been the darling of the saving market since launching in the UK and having consistently market-leading rates, has pulled out of the market after such an influx of new customers, leaving a hole for savers.We are now in the rare situation where the government-backed NS\u0026ampI is offering the market-leading east-access savings rate. But even here savers have been frustrated as the sheer volume of new customers, coupled with the restrictions on the organisation of working from home, mean many report long waits to open accounts or speak to customer service.Rachel Winter, associate investment director at the investment firm Killik \u0026amp Co, says: As non-essential businesses have now been allowed to re-open, and assuming that social distancing measures will be further relaxed over the coming months, we could see sectors such as retail rebound quicker than others. The next few months are crucial, but the Bank may need to take bold action if the economic nosee does not start to change direction, limiting the longevity of any recession. This isn’t only a consideration for the UK: global rates are expected to remain low and the Fed has already confirmed it will not raise rates until 2023.Returning to the cavalry analogy, Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets, has (rightly) criticised my choice of picture earlier. Here is a far better one!Gilts – UK government bonds - sold off, resulting in higher yields. Suren Thiru, head of economics of the British Chambers of Commerce, has sent us the lobby group’s thoughts. He is calling for more stimulus measures from the UK government to supplement the Bank of England’s action.The Bank of England’s decision to significantly expand quantitative easing reflects the unprecedented impact of coronavirus on the UK economy. It is vital that the Bank works with financial institutions to ensure that it translates into on the ground support for businesses.With economic conditions likely to remain challenging in the near term, further easing remains likely. However, with interest rates already at an historical low, extra loosening of monetary policy is unlikely to provide a significant boost to the economy. The central bank has rightly decided against moving interest rates into the negative, which risks doing more harm than good. The focus instead should be on delivering a fiscal environment that limits economic scarring and helps kickstart a recovery. This should include taking steps to close the remaining gaps in government support, including giving businesses with direct incentives to invest and hire, and stimulating consumer demand through a temporary, but significant cut in VAT.The Bank has been purchasing almost all the gilts issued in recent months to finance the covid-related support measures and would otherwise have reached its limit in July. And here is the Resolution Foundation, a respected think tank.So what do economists think of the Bank’s move?Dean Turner, economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, says speculation around negative interest rates won’t go away. (The Swiss National Bank has negative rates, for example, the lowest in the world.)As expected, the Bank has kept interest rates unchanged at today’s meeting. However, speculation of changes to the base rate, with the potential of negative rates, refuses to go away - this genie is going to be very hard to get back into the bottle now that it has been released. At this stage, we don’t believe the Bank will take rates lower this summer, let alone into negative territory.We may, however, see some evolution in the funding schemes for banks, to support lending to the economy. This could raise a few eyebrows, but has the potential to be more successful in increasing the flow of credit than cutting base rates alone.We continue to see concerns around the potential for negative interest rates, and more recently Brexit, as overdone. We expect the pound to strengthen against the weakening dollar as the year progresses.Here are the central bank’s comments in full that explain why it is slowing the asset-purchase programme, contained in the minutes of today’s meeting.The committee expected the new asset purchase programme to be completed, and the total stock of purchases to reach £745bn, around the turn of the year. With liquidity conditions having stabilised, purchases could now be conducted at a slower pace than during the earlier period of dysfunction. Should conditions worsen materially again, however, the Bank stood ready to increase the pace of purchases to ensure the effective transmission of monetary policy.Markets had been expecting a £100bn increase in QE and no change to interest rates, but the slower pace of the bond-buying programme and Andy Haldane’s dissenting vote were unexpected. The City had been expecting a unanimous vote.More from the Bank of England statement, which explains today’s policy moves:The emerging evidence suggests that the fall in global and UK GDP in 2020 Q2 will be less severe than set out in the May Report. Although stronger than expected, it is difficult to make a clear inference from that about the recovery thereafter. There is a risk of higher and more persistent unemployment in the United Kingdom. Even with the relaxation of some Covid-related restrictions on economic activity, a degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is likely to persist. The economy, and especially the labour market, will therefore take some time to recover towards its previous path.From the horse’s mouth:There are signs of consumer spending and services output picking up, following the easing of Covid-related restrictions on economic activity. Recent additional announcements of easier monetary and fiscal policy will help to support the recovery. Downside risks to the global outlook remain, however, including from the spread of Covid-19 within emerging market economies and from a return to a higher rate of infection in advanced economies.You can read the full Bank of England statement here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19878bf96831cf0f7941b234cb0226cde3c746ac/0_133_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d545607dd6c25f4e4e0f278e61b28438","title":"central banks pumped money economy democracy fairer society","story":"To build a fairer, greener society, money must be made to serve the people, not the other way aroundIn the past few months, the world’s central banks, above all the US Federal Reserve, have rescued the global economy from complete collapse for the second time in a generation. Wading unto the breach and armed with the knowledge of how close capitalism came to a system failure in 2008, they have fired the “big bazookas” of monetary policy, pumping trillions of dollars into the world’s giant pool of money, effectively creating wealth out of nothing.This confidence is misplaced. Both left and right have reason to welcome the Fed’s emergency intervention, but new money flooded into private capital markets will inevitably flow into the deepest pockets. And without strengthening the democratic legitimacy of this policy, and using it for socially transformative ends, the reaction will strengthen those who are antagonistic to the practice of government – the populist right.In his recent book, the French economist Thomas Piketty observes that central banks have become the only effectively functioning organs of government. He doesn’t mean this as a good thing. “Monetary activism” is financial triage against world economic collapse, but it’s also an avoidance tactic. It works by bracketing democracy and letting the technocrats take over. To make decisions about justice and distribution, discussions about taxation, policy and budgets are needed.As the Fed chairman Jerome Powell put it, the central bank has the power to lend but not to tax and spend. It is up to elected officials to “make decisions about where we as a society should direct our collective resources”. In the last two months, he has all but begged Congress to be more proactive in shaping the direction and volume of the policy.Progressives have reason to praise central banks for offering evidence that the “money printer can go brrr” without any clear limit. Economists see no sign of inflation on the horizon. Some have become concerned about inflation in recent weeks, but others worry about the opposite – deflation. All the extra liquidity has not managed to translate into meaningful growth.This makes an active role for the state in hiring people in sustainable jobs – in green energy, construction, arts, healthcare, education – all the more important. Public spending of the New Deal helped cure the Great Depression in the 1930s, so why not a Green New Deal for this one? Central bankers have emerged as unlikely allies in the fight against climate change. Maybe this latest intervention could finally open them up to the idea of “Green QE”, (quantitative easing) actively supporting decarbonisation by buying up environmentally friendly bonds.Republicans, for their part, are relieved that the Fed rescued the economy from meltdown, giving Donald Trump at least a chance of campaigning amid a recovery. Though unemployment is stratospheric and hundreds of Americans are still dying of Covid-19, the stock market’s worst fears seem to have been allayed by congressional action and the Fed’s promised bond-buying spree. But neither side should feel secure under the sheltering hand of unelected power like the central bank.The politics of money has a way of quickly becoming about other things. Last month, the German constitutional court concluded in a shock ruling that the European Central Bank may have exceeded its mandate in creating so much cheap credit, threatening the monetary response to the crisis. Within days, Viktor Orbán suggested that the Hungarian constitution might trump the decisions of the European Court of Justice in his country’s treatment of refugees.What kind of political creatures could the money-printing of central banks spawn? We have seen hints in the past. A decade ago, the proactive Fed was a target for the Tea Party movement. Republicans directed the backlash to control of the House in 2010 and eventually over Congress. Opposing President Barack Obama, the Republican party acted as a drag on recovery efforts and robust healthcare reform. The US is paying the price for their efforts with a dysfunctional healthcare system in a pandemic in which the victims have been disproportionately African American.There are reasons to think the response to the Fed’s actions from the right might be more extreme this time, not only because the scale of both spending and suffering is greater, but also because the fringe itself has become radicalised.Central banks have no shortage of enemies in waiting. President Trump’s description of the Fed as the “enemy” is designed to rob it of the very democratic legitimacy it cannot live without. Libertarians who reject all forms of “fiat currency” unbacked by precious metals, commonly known as “gold bugs”, have grown in influence over the past years. In the US, the most famous libertarian gold bug is probably Ron Paul, whose demand to “End the Fed” ran through his 2008 campaign. His son, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas have also voiced support for a gold standard. Returning to currency that is matched by finite gold reserves could act as a lever to lock in austerity, blocking the expansion of credit and state spending that would be necessary to redress inequality.In Germany, another gold bug, a former precious metals consultant, Peter Boehringer, sits in the Bundestag. His party, the Alternative for Germany, was founded by economics professors in 2013 over the politics of money – they rejected the European Central Bank’s monetary policy and management of the eurozone crisis.Another erstwhile gold bug now waits in the antechamber of the Fed itself. Until its recent postponement, Congress was scheduled to vote on the nomination of Judy Shelton to the Fed. Citing Ludwig von Mises and his student Friedrich Hayek as her guides, Shelton has called repeatedly in the past for the return to the “sound money” of a gold standard before converting to Trump’s loose monetary policy.For now, alongside the rumblings of a backlash, the actions of the Fed are receiving broad public approval. Elected officials should take this support as a sign that people do not instinctively reject a role for the government in the working of the market under emergency conditions.Lawmakers have time to build on this insight to work with central banks to design economies where uncertainty and hardship are diminished, even after coronavirus has passed. Central banks can be accessories to more equal and just societies, but they can never be the architects. Money must be made to serve the people, not the other way around."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a232bd320f6fb123df8a2f230ef6170cdfd23ac/0_162_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e24de1b26f41d06153be61a730cc57e5","title":"marcus rashford black athletes power change british racism poverty","story":"Black British sportspeople are seizing the moment to speak out about racism and povertyMarcus Rashford has done something that few of us can or ever will be able to achieve. The Manchester United and England forward has spurred a genuine change in social policy, altering the direction of government funding. And he has raised the awareness of two issues, food insecurity and holiday hunger, that should not be a problem in a country as wealthy as England.Rashford has been working with the charity FareShare, raising £20m to help it provide 3 million meals for vulnerable people. This week, his open and personal letter to the government (and his #maketheUturn campaign) asked it to reverse the decision to end the food voucher scheme before the summer holidays – vouchers that have been available to children on free school meals during the lockdown.In response to Rashford’s campaign, the government made a U-turn and set up the £120m “Covid summer food fund”. The fund will potentially benefit up to 1.3 million children eligible for free school meals in England. The 22-year-old from Wythenshawe didn’t need to do it. Rashford is young, rich and famous – and a black footballer, a tenuous position that provides little insulation from the pressure and attention of fans and the media that can topple a sports career faster than a cruciate knee ligament injury. But Rashford is part of a new wave of philanthropic black athletes giving their voice, their privilege and their wealth to social good. And for Rashford, like so many of these athletes, it’s personal.In recent years, Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling has called out the bigotry of the press and how its portrayal of black players fuels racism on the terraces. He has also advocated for more severe punishments for racism in football. Similarly in May, footballer Jadon Sancho took off his shirt, after scoring a goal for his German side Borussia Dortmund, to reveal the words “Justice for George Floyd” on a T-shirt, while world heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua recently attended a Black Lives Matter protest in his home town of Watford, where he called for a greater focus on self-determination within the black community. And Dina Asher-Smith, the 200m champion of the 2019 World Athletics Championships, has put her name to the letter by the Black Collective of Media in Sport (BCOMS) calling for an increase in the number of people of colour in the media.These athletes are responding to a sustained period of betrayal from the state in Britain. Black lives remain disposable, a statement that remains undeniable after recent years of austerity, the hostile environment, the leave campaign in the Brexit referendum, Grenfell, Covid-19 and continued police brutality. It is hard to ignore when injustice stares you in the face, when it hurts your loved ones or when it prevents your offspring from accessing essential services. The narrow historical lens of white Britain continues to view black people, as I wrote in my book No Win Race, “culturally through our bodies and in society through our pain”.Modern-day black British athletes are seizing the moment to speak out, more so than previous generations. Historically, black athletes in Britain have had to manage how to keep it real for the black community while not selling out to the white mainstream. Pioneering black footballers such as John Barnes and Brendon Batson faced this dilemma in the 1970s and 80s. They confronted racism quietly, letting their performances do the talking and rarely displaying the outspoken activism we would see from, say, the West Indian cricket team of the time.In the 90s Ian Wright, the Arsenal and England striker, now a popular pundit, was perhaps the first athlete to make blackness and Britishness look compatible. He symbolised a change in perception of black Britain. Wright was brash, brilliant and unapologetic, but also widely adored by white England fans. But this period did not translate into the type of changes in power, policy and wealth required to disrupt our vulnerability to disposability in society. Racism mutates. And the goalposts for black people shifted.Sports or entertainment remained the acceptable platforms for progression. But we could not get enough seats around the decision-making tables. Worse still, the narrative of a multicultural nation at ease with itself that emerged in the late 90s and early 2000s actually served to deny the existence of racism in the UK.If black British athletes continue to wield power, they have the potential to be a force for change in sport and society. We have seen African American athletes in the US use their wealth and status to influence social issues. Serena Williams has invested in businesswomen of colour, while basketball star LeBron James’s More Than A Vote campaign is encouraging young people to register while combatting voter suppression. NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has become a symbol for contemporary athlete activism. Former athletes from Africa such as Kenyan long-distance runner Tegla Loroupe, Ivory Coast footballer Didier Drogba and Congolese basketball star Dikembe Mutombo have all contributed hugely to social change in their countries.Rashford’s activism shouldn’t, of course, obscure the many groups who have been campaigning for equitable and inclusive food systems for years. Nor should it blur the impact of athletes – such as former England international Eniola Aluko – who opened the doors for this generation to be more vocal. Tackling structural racism and the root causes of child poverty remain a priority.But Rashford’s campaign provides a decisive moment and a refreshing change from the habitually negative media representation of black people in this country. There is power in this moment. There is power in the potential of Rashford and other athlete-philanthropists to create significant change collectively. It is not their responsibility. It is the norms of the state that need to change. But these athletes have run out of patience.

He was one of the rumoured candidates for the BBC director general job earlier this year.The Natural History Museum is one of the most popular in the world, attracting 5.3 million people during 2018 to 2019, making it the fourth most popular attraction in the UK.“The Natural History Museum’s vision of a future where people and planet thrive has never been more relevant and it is a privilege to be invited to lead this globally important cultural and scientific institution,” Gurr said.He said he was passionate about the work the museum was doing to tackle the “planetary emergency” by using its collection and scientific research to “connect millions of people a year with nature”.Gurr’s immediate concerns will be ensuring the museum’s stability during and in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, as cultural institutions around the world readjust to many months of lost income. Other challenges will be the growing number of repatriation claims for items in the museum’s collection, such as the recent request from Gibraltar for two Neanderthal skulls.The new director has extensive experience of running online food businesses, and has also previously served on boards and acted as a trustee for high-profile museums. Gurr was the chair of the Science Museum’s board from 2010 to 2014, and was a trustee of the National Gallery.He also acted as a non-executive director at the Department for Work and Pensions, which attracted criticism from the Labour MP and tax campaigner Margaret Hodge, who described his appointment as “disgusting” because Amazon was involved in a row over its taxes.Natural History Museum chair, Lord Stephen Green, said: “Doug’s academic background, considerable experience in working with public service organisations and digital understanding make him ideal to lead our treasured museum in our mission to create advocates for the planet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c67aa1a0a044d7bfcb1032fee10f6dd5a321dba/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=684c98c140663b837362133dbb4c990f","title":"scotland to ban mass culling of mountain hares","story":"Scottish parliament votes to give mountain hares special protection under the Wildlife and Countryside ActGamekeepers and grouse moor managers will be banned from mass culling mountain hares after Scottish ministers bowed to intense pressure from conservationists.The Scottish parliament voted on Wednesday night to give mountain hares special protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, which will make it an offence to intentionally or recklessly kill or injure the hare without a licence.Conservationists and animal welfare groups were delighted with the decision, which came as MSPs voted to ban salmon farmers from shooting seals and introduced far tougher penalties for wildlife crime amongst a series of new animal protection measures.Bob Elliot, the director of the animal welfare charity OneKind, and a former wildlife crime investigator, said his organisation and others had been pressing Holyrood to protect mountain hares for several years.“Different reasons given by the grouse shooting industry for the supposed need to control mountain hares, such as the prevention of louping ill, a disease carried by ticks, have been successively discounted, and animal welfare has taken precedence,” he said.The measure was introduced by Alison Johnstone, the Scottish Green party MSP, as a late amendment to the animal protection bill and accepted on Wednesday night by Mairi Gougeon, the Scottish rural affairs minister.The mountain hare, which live in the Highlands and upland areas of southern Scotland and northern England, is widely seen as an emblematic species it turns white in winter to aid camouflage in the snow. Up to 25,000 are thought to be shot each year by grouse moor managers and gamekeepers on the grounds they carry ticks and diseases which harm young red grouse, and also feed on heather, shrubs and saplings.The joint nature conservation committee, an expert advisory committee to the UK government, told the EU last year that mountain hares were in “unfavourable inadequate conservation status”, partly due to a lack of data about their numbers.The Werrity report for the Scottish government, which recommended licensing of grouse moors last year, also said mountain hares required greater protection.Sarah-Jane Laing, the chief executive of Scottish Land \u0026amp Estates, which represents landowners, said: “These changes will not help Scotland’s wildlife, which is the prime concern of gamekeepers and land managers.“Mountain hares are thriving on Scotland’s moors and their fate will not be improved by this vote. There is clear evidence that the control of hares helps combat tick and Lyme disease and protect plants and young trees. Balanced wildlife management is key to meeting Scottish government targets on bioersity and tree planting.”Alex Hogg, the chairman of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, said: “A grave mistake has been made today. This is a bad law, made by people it will not impact upon.“There will be no satisfaction in turning around in a few years and saying: we told you so, but, certainly, this is an important date in the demise of another iconic species, killed by political trade-offs and emotive campaigns.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63e16cab487e54b819addc1da39df0e1cf2e0206/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=61bbc16a1ebadfab74e17a11843ef353","title":"food live animal markets new york coronavirus","story":"Amid the coronavirus, calls have grown to ban the erse US markets that stock and slaughter live animals. But is that wise? John Harry was in the mood for chicken curry, so he walked two blocks from home to pick out a couple of birds.His destination was a squat warehouse surrounded by auto body shops, a scrapyard, and a school bus depot in the working-class neighborhood of Richmond Hill in Queens, New York. Inside was riotously loud, with the cries of chickens, duck, quail, guinea fowl and the tender pigeons known as squab, jostling for space and pecking seed in tall metal cages. In another room was a pen with lambs and goats butting heads and chewing alfalfa.The warehouse smelled powerfully of feathers and droppings, but Harry, a Guyanese construction worker in his 50s, seemed unfazed. He pointed out two broiler hens to a man in overalls who grabbed them, hung them by their legs from a scale, then carried them into a room strewn with feathers and drew a knife across their throats.“You can put your rice to boil, come get a chicken, be home before it burns,” Harry said. “Can’t get fresher than this.”The market he frequents, Madani Halal, is one of more than 80 in New York City that stock live animals and slaughter them on demand for customers. The markets are considered vitally important in many immigrant communities for cultural, religious or health reasons, contributing to the erse culinary landscape for which New York is famous. Since the 1990s the number of markets has nearly doubled, concentrated mostly in outer-borough immigrant neighborhoods. But since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, widely thought to have spread from a live animal market in China, a group of New York lawmakers has sought to shut these markets down, fearing that they pose a disease threat.Bills currently before the New York assembly and senate have requested an immediate moratorium on all live animal markets in the city. If passed, they would see the markets closed until a proposed new taskforce investigates concerns about public health and animal welfare in the sector.But critics of this plan, including researchers and community activists, say it unfairly targets immigrants, and is unlikely to reduce the risk of disease. They argue that it blurs issues of health and animal rights while overlooking the wider harms of industrial meat production.“This isn’t about food safety,” said Richard David, an activist from south Queens, home to a large number of the city’s live markets. “This is about food justice.”Some so-called “wet markets” in Asia, named for the common practice of hosing them down with water, stock exotic wildlife alongside live animals, providing a potential nexus for diseases to spread. This has led to growing calls around the world to ban them, even though the precise history of the coronavirus pandemic, widely thought to have originated at a seafood market in Wuhan, is still unclear.But the term “wet markets” has become confusing in the process, mixing up wildlife consumption with less exotic traditions, such as the poultry markets of New York. This has led to a situation where, in the rush to create a safer food system, culturally significant food practices, which pose comparatively minor public health risks, are coming under threat.In New York, animal rights groups have begun campaigning vigorously on issues of food safety, including staging protests outside markets. A recent petition by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) urges officials to shut down “blood-soaked slaughterhouses” in New York, specifically referring to the facilities as “wet markets” in an accompanying video. Peta has also urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to denounce live animal markets globally. The WHO has resisted these demands, saying that live markets provide food and jobs for millions of people.“Nobody is in favor of unsanitary markets,” said Nevin Cohen, a professor of public health at the Cuny Urban Food Policy Institute. “But instead of the kneejerk reaction of shutting them down, there are other policy tools, such as updating regulations or increasing enforcement.”These could include more frequent inspections and harsher penalties for non-compliance, he explained. “Banning these markets would eliminate some of the cultural ersity of our food system,” Cohen added. “It potentially sanitizes the city, in a bad way.”On a recent weekday morning, Awadh Radhakrishen, a parking garage attendant from Guyana, waited outside Madani Halal for his order. “You see everything here,” he told me. “You know what you’re eating.” But with supermarket chicken there was no way of telling, he said. “It might have been killed two weeks ago, two states away.”Live markets were a fundamental facet of New York’s culinary landscape until the rise of refrigeration in the 20th century. Modern supply chains physically distanced consumers from producers, increasingly shielding them from what the American food writer Michael Pollan has called “the shame of killing”. For this and other reasons, such as urbanization and rising incomes, meat consumption increased massively. At the same time, the harms of meat production multiplied, from toxic runoff at feedlots to the slaughterhouses that have emerged as Covid-19 hotspots, predominantly for low-paid immigrants and people of color.While that supply chain remains largely invisible, establishments like Madani Halal are wide open to public scrutiny. “It’s easier to pick on the little guy,” said Imran Uddin, the market’s owner.A big man with a full beard, Uddin left a career in advertising 20 years ago to take over the business from his father, a Bengali immigrant who began selling poultry in 1996. Uddin’s customers come from far and wide: the Caribbean, Latin America, China, south-east Asia. There are Punjabi Sikhs who buy and slaughter their own chickens, observing religious custom, and old Italian men from a different era in the neighborhood, when it was home mostly to European immigrants. “I see fewer of them each year,” Uddin said.Like all New York live markets, Madani Halal is licensed by the state department of agriculture and markets, subject to random inspections – of the animals and facilities – about once a month. Yet Uddin says he is in favor of even stricter regulation, conceding that some markets “cut corners”.According to the bill before the New York senate, inspectors have issued “a litany of violations” at live animal markets, including sidewalks with blood and feces and “allowing grime to accumulate on butchering equipment”.“Many of these markets can and should be improved,” said Krishnendu Ray, an associate professor of food studies at New York University. “But calls to eliminate them serve only to invoke disgust against the small practices of small people – while leaving intact the very large systems that are threats to health, animal welfare and the environment.”While organizations like Peta also campaign against industrial meat production, those corporations are vastly more powerful and less sensitive to activism.“If the alternative to these markets is mass-produced meat, we’re talking about displacing risk elsewhere, not reducing it,” said Cohen.Uddin recently drafted a petition for his customers, placing it on a clipboard at the cashier’s window. It reads: “I implore our representatives to reconsider the support for this new bill and empathize with the different cultural, ethnic and religious communities you represent.”So far, a few hundred people have signed, he said. Other customers had declined, wary of drawing attention to their immigration status. The petition by Peta has nearly 50,000 signatures. “People fear what they don’t know,” Uddin said.Uddin got into his truck and drove across the neighborhood with a delivery. Gousul Anwar, a Bangladeshi man who runs a dollar store in Manhattan’s Chinatown, was at home due to the pandemic he came to the door barefoot and in a shirt that read “Don’t panic”. He’d been buying meat from Uddin for more than 15 years, he said – and before that, from Uddin’s father. So had Anwar’s cousin, a slender man with a long beard who was sitting outside his apartment across the street. He waved and greeted Uddin warmly in Bengali. Both cousins were growing potted plants – tomatoes, peppers – fertilized with manure from Madani Halal.With only minor modifications, the scene resembled a kind of farm-to-table fantasy: the owner of a family business, delivering food and organic waste to customers he knew personally, providing a functioning, affordable alternative to the industrial meat system. Except in this case the participants weren’t virtuous middle-class shoppers, but working immigrants – “the fabric of New York”, Uddin called them afterwards.“They’ve left behind friends and family,” he said. “They work multiple jobs – the jobs Americans don’t want. And at the end of the day they want something that reminds them of home.“Those people are my customers,” he went on. “It disturbs me that people want to take this away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28351b63afcd2c9c0ff29867b634eeea67eaeea2/0_280_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ce031445c240f6cf8095ddbd5661ee1d","title":"how to find a good rose wine for under eight pounds","story":"From peachy Spaniards to lemony Italians, there’s a wine here to delight every palate. And no, we haven’t forgotten FrancePerhaps the surprise is more that a lot of rosé – especially the fashionably pale Provençal style – isn’t cheap. The average spend at Waitrose is £8.16 a bottle, more than for other still wines. So what can you get for under that?I had to plough through a fair number to kiss my prince, but there are some good buys under £8, and not just those on promotion. True, Provence is a struggle but the rest of southern France can even deliver under £7, as can neighbouring Spain and, occasionally, Italy.\u0026nbspThis peach-coloured Spanish rosé is, surprisingly, also peachy flavoured – almost as if it did have peaches or nectarines in it. Soft, rounded and voluptuous, the wine to sip on a warm afternoon or drink with a fat squidgy burrata.Ignoring the slightly irritating “proudly vegan” labelling, given a lot of wines are suitable for vegans nowadays, this is a satisfyingly characterful rosé. Frutti without being tutti. Brownie points too for some interesting pairings, including fried okra with spices, quinoa salad, and tomato and olive crostini. And, er, vegan in case you hadn’t got the message.The name and slightly girly-looking bottle may put off the brosé brigade (that is, men who drink rosé) but this is a convincing Provence drinkalike – pale, crisp and attractively citrusy. Have a glass with some prawns or smoked salmon.Fruité is the right word for this deep-coloured rosé, which is full of redcurrant and raspberry flavours. Despite the modest alcohol, it is quite gutsy and more of a barbecue than a picnic wine. And proof, at this price, that the Wine Society can and does compete with the supermarkets.You have to go for the mix-six deal to get this Italian rosé for under £8 but you would be mad to buy from Majestic on any other basis. A delicate, pale rosé with a fresh lemony bite that would be perfect with a plate of linguine and prawns with a fresh tomato sauce.\u0026nbsp This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

You can have a go at them while I step outside to work them off… Beaten into the lawn of my back garden, hard against the low wall up from the patio, are two footprints of dying grass. They mark the spot where, five times a week, I have been placing the step block that has become the replacement for my gym habit. I have literally climbed the height of a Himalayan mountain. I now view that murdered lawn as a visual sign of my atonement. Because the furious activity outside the door to the kitchen has been matched by my activity in it. I have cooked things I normally would avoid.\u0026nbspI eat them here, and work them off there. The outcome is that I have nailed three key dishes. And so, as a public service, and not in any way as a feeble justification for my outrageous kitchen habits, I shall now share them with you.First up, the oven chip, forever the sad relation of the proper deep-fried item, lacking in crispness outside, fluffiness inside and hope. They are a reminder of what you’re not eating. Here’s the solution. Cut the potatoes into chips. Cook in salted boiling water until almost done. Drain, and spread them out on kitchen paper on a tray in the fridge for at least two hours. When you’re ready, put the oven to at least 220Cgas mark 7 and put an oven tray in there with close to a centimetre of vegetable oil for about 15 minutes until it’s smoking. Introduce fridge cold chips to very hot oil. Turn them every 10 minutes until chip heaven is achieved. It should take about 45 minutes. Drain on kitchen paper. Sprinkle with sea salt. Eat them. Thank me.Onwards. One day, about 3pm, my neighbour Marc texted me a picture of pork belly with gloriously crackled skin. I was baffled. He was working from home. Was he about to have lunch? Nope. He had roasted it on high for 40 minutes and wanted me to admire it. That was followed by nearly three hours on 130Cgas mark ¾ and 15 more minutes back on high. Finally, he rested it under foil for an hour. He sent me pictures all the way through. I later tried this method and sent him pictures. In lockdown I have been exchanging pictures of roast pork with my neighbour. If you cook pork belly this way you too will send pictures to your loved ones. It’s that good: perfect crackling, soft collapsing meat. Thank me again. Or thank Marc.Finally, I have discovered that spaghetti should be braised. Yes, really. I made pork meatballs from equal amounts of ground pork and Toulouse sausages pulled from their skins. I seared those in a cast-iron casserole, removed them, and slow cooked an onion in the seasoned fat. I broke up the dry spaghetti and turned it in the onions and fat, before topping up with double the volume of chicken stock from a cube. (So 300g of spaghetti needs 600ml of stock.) I placed the meatballs back on the top and put it in the oven preheated to 180Cgas mark 4, lid on, for about 10 minutes. I took off the lid and returned it to the oven for a further five minutes. I did all this because I was in lockdown and bored. What was the worst that could happen? If it was lousy, I’d make the family sandwiches. It wasn’t lousy. It was gorgeous. The spaghetti soaked up all the stock and became a rich buttery tangle, but still with bite. Thank me one final time. There you go: chips, pork belly, spaghetti. That’s at least two key food groups covered. The good ones. This is my gift to you from lockdown. Now do excuse me. There’s a step block requiring my attention.Jay will post pictures of these triumphs to his Instagram account: @jayrayner1"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e392c60bcfc67bc9f3f50f4220c48b6c6605ce73/368_0_2055_1233/master/2055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2e3ce3a5782bb963aeaa52951f1203b","title":"timo werner signing shows chelsea mean business and they are not done","story":"Club have confirmed forward’s arrival and their ruthless touch appears to be returning after tepid few years in transfer marketAs statements of intent go Chelsea’s signing of Timo Werner from RB Leipzig, confirmed on Thursday, is the clearest signal yet of their determination to rub shoulders with Europe’s elite again. A striker coveted by Bayern Munich and Liverpool will be wearing a blue shirt next season and, while Frank Lampard’s side still have to make sure they can offer their newest addition Champions League football, it is hard not to feel that Chelsea’s ruthless touch is returning after a tepid few years in the transfer market.The mood has changed. Six months ago Lampard cut a frustrated figure. He made it clear he wanted attacking reinforcements after Chelsea’s transfer embargo was halved in December and struggled to hide his disappointment when nobody arrived in January. A team low on creative inspiration following the sale of Eden Hazard to Real Madrid last summer needed an injection of class and Lampard’s concerns looked justified when Bayern won 3-0 at Stamford Bridge in February.Chelsea have not made it past the last 16 of the Champions League since 2014 and are unlikely to improve that record when they visit Bayern for the second leg in August. Even so the growing sense is of a club on the up again, with the recruitment department and the head coach on the same wavelength and Roman Abramovich willing to provide funds to land key targets. Shortly after that quiet deadline day Chelsea agreed a £37m deal to sign Hakim Ziyech from Ajax in the summer and now they have pulled off another coup, sharpening their attack after winning the race for Werner.“It is a very proud moment for me to be joining this great club,” Werner told Chelsea’s website, which said he would link up with the squad in July, subject to a medical. That means, as anticipated, he will not play in the Champions League for Leipzig. Werner predicted “a very successful future” at Stamford Bridge.Whereas Bayern and Liverpool dithered, Chelsea pounced. They have paid £47.5m for Werner and, with the coronavirus pandemic potentially affecting budgets at other clubs, see an opportunity to make some decisive leaps. They have not used the £105m received for Hazard, Atlético Madrid are due to spend £48.5m to make Álvaro Morata’s loan permanent and further sales could boost the budget. All being well more new faces will follow Werner and Ziyech. Lampard wants Kai Havertz – a tricky one to pull off given that Bayer Leverkusen want at least €100m (£90m) for the 21-year-old winger – and likes the Leicester City left-back Ben Chilwell.It could come down to choosing between Havertz and Chilwell. Both will be costly. Leicester are tough negotiators and although Chilwell fancies the move, Ajax’s Nicolás Tagliafico and Porto’s Alex Telles are cheaper alternatives at left-back.The most inexperienced manager in the Premier League has made some shrewd moves so far. He was wise to move on quickly after venting on 31 January and has protected his relationship with Marina Granovskaia, the powerful director. He played a key role in landing Ziyech, the gifted Moroccan playmaker, and also laid on the charm when it came to nabbing Werner, whose 32 goals in all competitions this season mark him out as one of the finest forwards in Europe.Ziyech has said Lampard bombarded him with texts to convince him to join, an approach that Werner will recognise. Before lockdown Lampard and Petr Cech, appointed as the club’s technical and performance adviser last summer, met Werner in Germany. They laid out their plans and struck up a rapport with the 24-year-old.Sources have said Cech has been heavily involved in the deal. Cech and Lampard, teammates for a decade, combined to convince Werner. After a season of frustration in the final third, Chelsea have their marquee forward – a player capable of playing through the middle or on the left, with the ability to operate alone or in a two, and the awareness to take and create chances. Although they could do with more oomph in central defence, there is no doubt that buying Werner is a step in the right direction.The German’s versatility will allow him allow him to play as a lone forward or work in tandem with Tammy Abraham or Olivier Giroud, and he keeps going when he misses chances. Werner comes back for more – no doubt there will be plenty of opportunities with Ziyech in midfield – and his determination to hit the ground running can be seen in his willingness to move to London in July and miss Leipzig’s Champions League quarter-final.It is a coup for Lampard, who inherited a squad in need of renewal last summer. He has given the kids a chance but Chelsea need more conviction. Although they have impressive options in central midfield, an overhaul is overdue in other positions. Willian and Pedro, both of whom are out of contract on 30 June, are coming to the end. There are doubts over Ross Barkley, Marcos Alonso, Jorginho, Emerson Palmieri and Michy Batshuayi. Tiémoué Bakayoko, a dud signing, has no future at the club.Chelsea must work hard to catch Liverpool and Manchester City at the top of the league. Callum Hudson-Odoi and Christian Pulisic, young wingers with potential, are unproven. Mason Mount is learning and Ruben Loftus-Cheek is on his way back from a serious injury. Lampard should not settle if there are big deals to be done. Havertz, a target for Bayern, Madrid, Liverpool and United, would enhance his side’s threat.Do not rule out Havertz. Chelsea mean business. They have short-term targets to meet, a place in the top four to protect, but Lampard wants trophies. The spending is unlikely to stop with Werner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78edf4effe4255b3f138c1ff96abab0eac49e1f6/280_240_2933_1760/master/2933.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f93a341638fdc4977cfe67ff29a6105","title":"mario balotelli v massimo cellino and a homecoming that turned sour","story":"The striker’s return to the town where he grew up has become a battle between him and the local club’s owner, Massimo CellinoMario Balotelli’s stomach ache returned over the weekend. The Brescia striker had only been allowed back into his club’s training base last Wednesday after six days off with gastroenteritis. He was scheduled for a pair of inidual workouts on Saturday but left the facility after completing the first, having suffered an apparent relapse. A post on his Instagram Stories simply said: “Sick.”Hours earlier, he had shared a video of himself on the same platform, still sweating from the morning practice session. “Stop asking if I’m going to training or not,” he said. “I’m going to training guys. I have always been training.”He has not done it with his teammates, though, since early March. When Serie A clubs were given the green light to resume training last month, Balotelli was notably absent from Brescia’s group work. The club’s owner, Massimo Cellino, told the BBC World Service: “He doesn’t show up to training, he doesn’t look very committed, let’s say, for the future of the club.”The question of who was responsible for such non-attendance may finish up in court. Cellino began proceedings this month to have Balotelli’s contract terminated for just cause, an extraordinary step when you consider that it was already likely to expire this summer. The one-year deal Balotelli signed last August would automatically be extended if Brescia avoided relegation, but they are bottom of Serie A, with nine points to make up in 12 games.The picture painted by the club is of a player who opted out. Asked by the newspaper Corriere della Sera why Balotelli was not training with the first-team squad, Brescia’s manager, Diego López, blamed a failure to engage during lockdown with online training tools provided by the club.“It was optional, OK, but the rest of the group took one path and he took the other,” said López. “During quarantine, on Zoom, he did not show himself. Even if he says he is in good shape, he is not on the level of his teammates.”Balotelli has not spoken so directly on the matter, but his social media posts and brief interactions with the press suggest that he feels unfairly excluded. After his first bout of gastroenteritis, he sought to resume training at Brescia’s facility on 9 June, but was turned away at the gates – apparently because he had not updated the club early enough about his recovery. As he trudged back to his car, he was heard protesting: “Then they say that I won’t train.”The dispute has other threads. Balotelli has initiated legal action against Brescia over unpaid wages from March. His agent, Mino Raiola, accused the club of failing to put Balotelli through a mandatory Covid-19 test. Brescia defined that latter claim as “false and slanderous”, warning that their legal team had been instructed to pursue the matter in the relevant chambers. Balotelli has been invited to give his account to an Italian Football Federation hearing on Thursday.How did it come to this? Balotelli’s move to Brescia was supposed to be a triumphant homecoming, a rare talent – albeit one whose potential had never been fully realised – returning to the town where he grew up, to play for the team he once served as a ballboy. The Rondinelle (Little Swallows) had just been promoted to the top flight after eight years outside it. They believed Balotelli could deliver the goals to keep them there.He is the club’s top scorer this season but five goals in 19 games are hardly transformative. In a tale familiar from too many other stops in his career, Balotelli has sparkled only intermittently, serving up brilliant goals against Verona and Lazio but failing to leave a mark on other occasions. Two of Brescia’s four wins so far this season arrived while he was still serving out a suspension picked up at his previous club, Nice.Were the expectations on him always unrealistic? Brescia’s squad are not without talent – the 20-year-old midfielder Sandro Tonali is one of Italian football’s brighter prospects – but lack the depth to thrive at this level. Cellino’s impatience has not helped, either. He fired Eugenio Corini as manager in November, replacing him with Fabio Grosso for three games before swapping back. Corini lost the job again in February, this time being replaced by López.It is not easy for any player to adjust constantly to different managers with different ideas about how the game should be played, but the changes can only feel more acute for one who tends to be singled out for special treatment. Grosso threw Balotelli out of a training session and excluded him from a trip to Roma. López gave him the captain’s armband.On top of all this, Balotelli also found himself back at the centre of Italian football’s continuing struggle with racism. He was subjected to monkey chants during the defeat at Verona and responded by kicking a ball at the perpetrators. The opposition manager, Ivan Juric, and president, Maurizio Setti, ridiculously insisted no racist abuse had taken place.That claim was contradicted by independent observers but, even then, the partial stadium closure handed down as a punishment was appealed into a suspended sentence. One ultra was banned from attending games by Verona after telling a local radio station that, in his eyes, Balotelli could never be “fully Italian”.Even in Brescia’s own stadium, Balotelli has been targeted. A game against Lazio was interrupted as the PA and the visitors’ manager, Simone Inzaghi, implored away fans to stop making racist chants.Then there were Cellino’s remarks in November. Asked about Grosso’s decision to drop Balotelli, the owner replied: “What can I say? That he’s black and he’s working to whiten himself but he has great difficulties in this.”It was defended by some as a play on words – “nero”, the Italian word for “black” is sometimes used as an adjective to stress a deep level of anger – but Cellino refused even to acknowledge that his phrasing could have upset anyone.Only Balotelli can know how greatly these incidents did or didn’t affect him. From the outside looking in, we can only observe the broad arc of what can feel at times like a story stuck on repeat: optimistic beginnings giving way to a fractious end.In the lexicon of Italian football, “stomach ache” has frequently been used as a euphemism for a player’s desire to change clubs: a call-back to Zlatan Ibrahimovic telling a reporter that his questions were causing him such symptoms during his final season at Inter. Balotelli could find worse models than the Swede for how a striker can continue to reinvent themselves into a fourth decade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d30783bb909a44516f3a75dd1786e788d06664d8/0_0_3506_2105/master/3506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a706e1507763dfd9554f8a3528da8746","title":"mexico churches catholic mass covid 19 coronavirus","story":"Thousands of worshippers sneak in to invitation-only assemblies organized like illegal dance parties, despite rising death tollsThe invitations arrive via text message or social media. “They ask you for a kind of password to let you in,” said Jesús Preciado, whose father has attended the secretive gatherings in the Mexican state of Jalisco.Diego Martínez, whose mother has attended the backstairs events, said they were off-limits to anyone not in the know. “It’s invitation-only,” he said. “They call you and tell you the place and the date.”The assemblies into which Preciado, Martínez and thousands of other Mexicans have been sneaking might be organised like illegal dance parties. But they are actually clandestine Catholic masses that have continued to take place in defiance of a coronavirus ban on religious events.“The bells don’t ring, there are no calls to mass,” said Antonio Hernández, who has watched worshippers steal into secret sessions at the Sagrado Corazón de Jesús church in the town of Ixtapa.“You just see the people arrive a few minutes before 6.30pm, enter the temple through the back door and then after that you start to hear their prayers,” Hernández added.The Mexican Episcopal Conference suspended mass in early March, when the first coronavirus cases were reported in Mexico.Days later the federal government suspended all religious activities involving crowds.Worshippers at the Nuestra Señora de Fátima church in Zacatecas have been allowed into secret masses on the condition they sit behind the camera live-streaming the liturgy on Facebook.In Jalisco’s capital, Guadalajara, the faithful have continued to frequent the San José y Santo Tomás de Aquino church.“I went to mass on Sunday, behind closed doors, and there were just 12 of us in the congregation,” said Susana García, a 64-year-old regular.In Durango state, catechists, choir members and youth leaders have received written notice of the underground rituals. “Only people close to the church go,” said Vicente Martínez, a member of the Catholic community in the city of Gómez Palacios.Martínez said all churches had been closed there. “But they have hidden activities for 30 or 40 people each Thursday. They do a callout where they describe it as an exclusive and private mass with refreshments after.”In late May authorities launched a mid-mass raid on one local church, the Nuestra Señora de la Luz, and caught 20 people, mostly elderly women, praying red-handed.In Brazil, home to the world’s largest Catholic congregation and also a rapidly growing and politically powerful community of born-again Christians, evangelicals have also made surreptitious church visits.“Lift up your hands and shout: ‘I wasn’t chosen to hide myself!’” Pastor Gilvrando Rodrigues shouted at a recent service for about 80 believers at his church in Rio’s biggest favela, Rocinha.“I won’t accept having to cower in a cave, I won’t accept hiding in a hole because I have a calling from God,” Rodrigues added as he encouraged his flock – most of whom were not wearing face masks – to flout social isolation for their faith.“You could have stayed at home. But you needed to be here taking care of your salvation,” the preacher said.Such services have been easier to pull off in Rio than Mexico.The city’s mayor, Marcelo Crivella, is an evangelical bishop from the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God who, alongside Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been actively pushing for churches to reopen.Rio’s state governor outlawed religious gatherings in mid-March when a partial shutdown began and a legal tug-of-war has been playing out ever since over whether churches should open, or not.“It’s all very confused,” said Rodrigues. Last week a judge ruled services could resume.Bolsonaro, who is heavily reliant on the support of some of Brazil’s most influential televangelists, has defended the right to worship and dismissed the coronavirus as a “little flu” even as his country’s death toll has soared to more than 45,000 – the second-highest tally in the world after the US.At least 60 of those deaths happened in Rocinha and Rodrigues, who himself contracted the disease early in the pandemic, admitted the virus was no joke.“But we can’t stop proclaiming the word of Christ either,” he insisted, calling churches an essential service.The pastor claimed God had allowed the pandemic, partly in order to help transform the church. Faith had become a commodity, Rodrigues complained.At a recent Sunday service he told congregants: “You’ve listened to the word and received God’s blessing. And now, whoever would like to pay tribute to the house of the Lord, feel free.“Those who give, receive,” Rodrigues added, as he asked for help to fund building work on the church. “And those who sow, will reap.”Some of the names in this report have been changed to protect identities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdabae28b0b3fee9800acb92421b2238fd6111c8/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c330db2bc96266a1e007437ba09e0604","title":"forcibly displaced now account for 1 of humanity un report","story":"Almost 80 million people are refugees or internally displaced, with the number doubling in the past decadeThe number of people forcibly displaced from their homes has doubled over the past decade to almost 80 million, according to the UN refugee agency.The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned of long-term consequences for many of the displaced. “Forced displacement nowadays is not only vastly more widespread but is simply no longer a short-term and temporary phenomenon,” he said.“We need a fundamentally new and more accepting attitude towards all who flee, coupled with a much more determined drive to unlock conflicts that go on for years and that are at the root of such immense suffering.”According to UNHCR’s global trends report, only 4 million refugees were able to return to their home countries during the past decade, compared with 1.5 million every year in the 1990s. Protracted conflicts, the agency warned, were making voluntary repatriations increasingly unlikely.He said numbers presented by the UN and humanitarian agencies often focused on headlines about record figures but should also be presented in the context of government policy, with more analysis about why numbers are growing.“It doesn’t actually tell you much about the situation and the conditions of people, the protection problems they’re encountering, the growing resistance among countries to admit people, the growing tendency to push refugees back to their countries,” he said.According to the UN’s study, more than half of displaced people were displaced within their own countries.Crisp said it was significant that so many people were internally displaced and called for more analysis about why this was the case. “If you’re talking about increased numbers then you should also be talking about what are the responses to those increased numbers,” he said.“The numbers of internally displaced people are going up much more quickly than refugees, which begs the question: why are people being displaced within their own countries rather than crossing borders, and … is it linked directly to countries increasing border controls?”The latest figures include previously uncounted people in Venezuela, who were not registered as displaced or refugees but were in need of support.UNHCR said the climate crisis was increasingly playing a part in displacement, forcing people from their homes and making living conditions worse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bdf5e9ffccff98747a663bd8a1a5131d499dc31/0_382_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=669560bfcc8c2f6ac04df89e0142863a","title":"being online has helped us survive how e commerce can kickstart your small business in lockdown and beyond","story":"Many SMEs have had to ramp up their digital activity in response to the challenges of Covid-19, learning as they go. Here, three businesses share what they’ve discoveredGiven the way that we shop is changing, it has never been more important for retailers to get online. In a survey for the website builder GoDaddy, a fifth of micro businesses said they had gone online for the first time during lockdown and nearly half that their use of digital and social media tools had increased.For some, e-commerce has always been part of the plan. The artisan hot chocolate company Knoops opened its first store in Rye, East Sussex, in 2013, and went on to open a London store in February this year, with more planned. But head of marketing Anna Chapman says that having an online presence was always a key part of the company’s strategy. “Chocolate has a broad appeal, and we wanted to be able to reach people in their homes, especially those who didn’t live near our stores,” she says.\u0026nbspThe company’s website centres around its hot chocolate maker, the Knoopifier, with owners getting access to online subscriptions for pouches of “Knoopifier” chocolate buttons delivered to their home. The website has always been an important part of the company’s strategy, but Chapman says that lockdown emphasised this further.\u0026nbsp“While our doors were closed, it was obviously the only way we could take any revenue at all, and we were able to focus our efforts entirely on our website and social media channels,” she says. “This importance will remain – the majority of retailers now accept that an omnichannel approach is vital. Our current situation has been an extremely stark reminder of its importance.”For other SMEs, while a website may have been part of their business, using it to sell is a recent addition. Rob Wilson, “chief toaster” at Toast Ale, a craft beer brewer that uses bread which would otherwise be wasted, says that despite having an online presence, it wasn’t really part of the business’s strategy.\u0026nbspBut when those sales channels were cut off during lockdown, Toast Ale, which donates its profits to sustainability charities, was forced to shift its sales online. “We started to rebuild our website and have far more focus on a more functional online shop. It has massively transformed our business and helped us survive – it’s become a huge opportunity to reach a whole new audience. We just hadn’t thought about it as a sales channel and now we’ve suddenly realised its potential.”Similarly, Chris Fryer, founder of the vegan pie business Magpye, hadn’t really explored e-commerce, instead selling pies from his converted horse box at events and supplying local pubs in the north of England. “We had a full calendar of events booked. We were supplying pubs with pies and had just expanded, dropping off to four or five pubs twice a week. Then our income stopped – it was a cliff-edge.”\u0026nbspLike Wilson at Toast Ale, Fryer realised quickly that he would have to shift to e-commerce and has been similarly amazed by the effect it has had.\u0026nbsp“At the moment we’re just doing local deliveries across the north east but we’re looking into expanding. Our plan potentially is to sell our horsebox and become a web-based pie shop,” he says.When it comes to setting up an e-commerce site, there is an increasingly wide range of tools available to business owners from a range of sources. They include web hosting companies such as GoDaddy, which has created Open We Stand – a portal of resources for small businesses during lockdown. Fryer says that while he has some experience building websites, it was quicker and easier to turn to readymade tools with GoDaddy.“I had the domain registered with GoDaddy but had done nothing with it. Once it became clear we would have to move online I started looking into it. I could have gone down the route of coding it from scratch but it would have taken a week or two, especially things like payment options. With the GoDaddy tools it took half a day, then I spent a day or two testing and it was ready to go. Although we didn’t use the option, I knew GoDaddy would build the site for you for free if you needed,” he says.“They do a free three-month trial, so there’s really nothing to lose by having a go. The admin side, monitoring it, doing the orders is all quite simple, so even if you’ve got no skills whatsoever I don’t think many people would struggle with it.”At Toast Ale, the switch was led by COO Louisa Ziane, who has experience of managing websites. Wilson is adamant that the work has paid off, with e-commerce proving an “amazing opportunity”, not just now but, he believes, in the future. “I would say that at current rates we’re looking at probably half a million pounds of revenue coming from our online shop. Last year as a business we took around £1m in total, so that shows that it is very quickly becoming a significant part of our business.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed. Over 50 companies have joined the cause, including Slack, Salesforce, PayPal, and more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eea7bef72fa35bc81fa73b12bb23f585bbdb0cb/0_0_3211_1927/master/3211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e00714bc18766e42e50cb4ba4f593eed","title":"senior cps lawyer investigated for posting britain first petition","story":"Kim Kendall shared petition on Facebook calling for statue of ‘terrorist’ Nelson Mandela to be ‘torn down’ A senior lawyer at the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is under investigation after a petition from far-right group Britain First calling for the statue of Nelson Mandela to be “torn down” was posted on her Facebook page.The petition was shared on the Facebook page of Kim Kendall, a senior lawyer at the Yorkshire and Humberside CPS. It accuses Mandela of being “a communist and terrorist mass murderer” who should be “consigned to the dustbin of history”.An aspect of Black Lives Matter protests following the killing of George Floyd in America has focused on removing statues of figures associated with racism and the oppression of black people, including that of Edward Colston in Bristol.CPS employees are civil servants and required to be impartial, particularly when making decisions about whether inidual cases should proceed to court or not.Kendall’s investigation by her employers follows complaints by at least two lawyers who were concerned about the material on her Facebook page. Other posts which appeared on her timeline and referred for investigation include one originally posted by another Facebook user about the murder of the soldier Lee Rigby, saying: “I don’t remember the UK rioting after 2 black immigrants hacked to death a white British soldier in broad daylight … Just saying!”At the top of Kendall’s Facebook page was a March 2018 change.org petition calling for Asian Labour MP Naz Shah “to resign or be sacked”.It is understood one of the complaints called for a review of all of Kendall’s cases involving black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) defendants or complainants. The matter has also been referred to the Solicitors Regulation Authority.Kendall’s Facebook was removed after the  approached the CPS.According to the CPS Code of Conduct employees must not post statements on Facebook or other social media which contravenes their obligations. “Employees must not compromise their political neutrality,” the code adds.Standards of conduct include “ensuring personal views do not influence the way an employee carries out their official work”.Richard Lunn, a solicitor and director at Haywood, Lunn and Allen, one of the lawyers who called on the CPS to investigate Kendall’s Facebook posts, said: “We in the legal profession need to be completely objective, not allow our personal views to influence our work, nor put anything on social media that would reduce faith in our profession. The system works because of trust that those doing the job are completely objective. If that trust disappears the system will fail.”Attiq Malik, a criminal lawyer who saw Kendall’s posts, expressed alarm about them: “As a campaigning lawyer against racism it is extremely concerning to learn that there are those in our profession who have Britain First posts appearing on their Facebook page.”He added that in the criminal justice system it is vital for public confidence that any structural racism is combatted and that those who pass through the system are dealt with fairly and impartially.A CPS spokesperson said: “Impartiality and fairness are central CPS values and these are underpinned by a clear code of conduct. Any allegations of inappropriate behaviour are taken very seriously and investigated thoroughly.”Last month Paul Golding, leader of Britain First, was found guilty of an offence under the Terrorism Act after refusing to give police access to his mobile phone on his return from a political trip to Russia.Kendall’s husband is Mark Kendall, coroner for Grimsby and North Lincolnshire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4236fa14930ddf2de650188ae86c7a1e9d60235b/0_178_7819_4692/master/7819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5b325f7d5c989d7aea435def2d5f6d4","title":"covid clearout charity shop lockdown coronavirus scope communities","story":"Many of us have missed the likes of Scope just as much as Primark or John Lewis. We spend a day with happily returning customers, donors and staffThere’s a new purple wheelie bin on Walthamstow High Street in north-east London, outside No 210, and it’s filling up fast. Michael Armstrong and Louise Craven have just put a bag of books in. “We’ve got several bags from lockdown tidying and we’re going to bring it in one bag at a time,” says Michael. He doesn’t sound like he’s from north-east London. Because he isn’t – he’s originally from California. He came here 40 years ago, “for the weather”, says Craven, his partner, drolly.Her irony maybe backfires a little today. It’s a glorious day in Walthamstow – the high street is pretty much Sunset Boulevard minus the palms.Among the books is what Armstrong describes as “some rather odd poetry journals”, a study of American architecture and The Glass Room by Simon Mawer, which they have both read and recommend.They’re not getting thrown away but recycled, hopefully reread. Because No 210, set between a betting shop and a fish bar, is a charity shop belonging to Scope, the national disability charity. This week, like other non-essential retailers, charity shops in England were able to open for the first time in almost three months, to customers and for donations.Another bag goes into the purple bin. This one contains a brown jacket from Ben Odamtten, who says it’s too small for him. There’s also a card holder and two pairs of shades in his bag. And I have donated a couple of bags, mostly of outgrown children’s clothes. I wanted to bring the popcorn machine, too, but my family wouldn’t let me. No one needs a popcorn machine.Scope’s area manager, Lara Woolston, explains the new process. Donations go from the purple bin into heavy-duty bin bags, which are labelled with the date, tied up with giant rubber bands, taken to a room above the store and left for 72 hours to minimise any risk of infection. Safety of staff, volunteers and customers is Scope’s priority, I’m told, often.The acting shop manager, Celia Mullins, is up here, busy clearing out bays that can be filled in date order. Quarantine for donated clothes, books, CDs, sunglasses etc is going to be stricter and better organised than it is for arrivals at UK airports. There’s already a lot of stuff up here, but if it fills up there is an overflow storage unit in Barking.They have done a lot on the shop floor, too, putting in all the necessary safety measures. It has all been unmuddled and decluttered the rummage boxes – with things, such as toys, that kids would play with – have been removed from the floor. “We’re trying to limit the number of times people need to touch things,” says Woolston.Fitting room? Not any more – it’s taped off like a crime scene. Buy it if it doesn’t fit, bring it back. And there’s a one-way system, with arrows on the floor, plus “sneeze screens” at the tills. Customers are offered hand sanitiser along with a mask and gloves on entering. “It’s been a long time since we’ve been able to welcome our wonderful community through our doors,” says Woolston. For the moment though, they are only allowing one person – or one family – in at a time.It’s the same story across the whole sector: the pandemic makes no allowances for good causes. The chancellor Rishi Sunak’s £750m bailout fund for charities didn’t come close to replacing lost income, not just because of shops being closed but also because of the cancellation of other means of fundraising – the London Marathon and the Great North Run to name two massive ones. Street-funding, too, as well as the possibility that people are more likely to give to NHS charities at the moment. A study published last week found that one in 10 charities faces bankruptcy by the end of the year as they struggle with a £10bn shortfall caused by a perfect storm of massive income reduction and rocketing demand for their services. “It’s been a devastating loss of income,” Scope’s head of retail, Debbie Boylen, tells me over the phone. “Because it’s been at a time when disabled people need us the most.”I could have spent the morning at any charity shop and the picture would have been similar. I’ve come to Scope simply because it’s where we usually bring stuff to. That said, my local branch isn’t among the first wave of 16 shops around the country opening as lockdown eases, so I’ve travelled across London. Hence just the two bags: there’s plenty more to come at home, under the stairs, from our own Covid clearout. Boylen thinks it’s not just us. “Everybody I speak to is saying the same, that they’ve been clearing out cupboards and wardrobes over the past few months.”Each bag is worth, on average, £20 to Scope 81 bags would, for example, allow it to run its Parents Connect support programme, for parents and carers of young disabled people in Leeds, for a week.The bin is soon full, the contents bagged up and taken up to Mullins to be placed in quarantine. This system for dropping stuff doesn’t allow gift aid to be claimed for donations, says Woolston, so they miss out on that, but it’s unavoidable with the only-one-in-the-shop policy. That may be relaxed, but for now gift aid donors can’t be expected to queue.As well as the purple wheelie bin, that’s the other new thing outside No 210: a queue. Beautifully spaced, orderly, patient, not as long as the ones outside Asda and Lidl down the street but undeniably a queue. It seems the appetite not just to donate but to shop in charity shops is alive and well. “I’ve missed it,” says Shahnaz Khan, one of the first people in. “You can get so many nice things from here, and the people are very nice.” She comes out with a pink handbag.Alan Donoghue, who used to work here and is queuing on a mobility scooter, says it’s a good way to pass the morning. “It does you good mentally, and also sometimes there might be stuff that you want.” He’s not after anything specific, though he’s always on the look out for tea towels, fridge magnets and commemorative plates.Is anyone here for something specific, Woolston asks the queue. “Tennis racket,” says a man named Mike Anderson. He tells me he’s started playing a bit in order to start seeing people. He has been borrowing his friend’s girlfriend’s racket but now is the time to take responsibility. Two minutes later, Woolston is back out of the shop with a choice of two: Anderson opts for the more expensive, a Slazenger for a fiver. The deal is done on the street. “Probably illegally,” laughs Woolston.Anderson is chuffed enough with his purchase. “Charity shop, so, you know, standards are slightly lower,” he says. “But it looks lovely, it’s got its own cover if anybody saw me walking towards a tennis court they would think I was going to play tennis, which is half the battle won, isn’t it?”Nina Bright doesn’t shop anywhere but charity shops, except for socks and underwear. So she hasn’t bought any clothes for three months. She’s just happy to be out looking and isn’t bothered about the queue. “It’s fine – I’ve got nothing else to do,” she says. Nor is she bothered that, once she does get inside the shop, she doesn’t find anything to buy. She dismisses it as “the lottery of thrifting”.Maybe Odion Edgal will be more successful. She’s on the hunt for books she ran out over lockdown. “I miss books a lot – I need something to read.” She finds something – not Armstrong and Craven’s odd poetry journals or American Architecture, but Camp David, David Walliams’s 2012 autobiography. For £2. “That’s why I come – I can’t afford to go to Waterstones.”There have been 56 bags of donations in Walthamstow. Not quite enough for a week of Parents Connect, unless there are some treasures in there – a Mulberry handbag perhaps – and Woolston and Mullins won’t know for another couple of days, when they can open up the bags. Maybe those poetry journals will turn out to be rare treasures and can be sold at auction for millions. Maybe.It’s going to pick up further as more charity shops open and people realise this, and then get their acts together to get down there. I know of several bags destined for a purple bin in the near future one of them might just have a kitchen gadget snuck in there. Maybe someone does need a popcorn maker – just not me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7527670448f183da39582a9c977177e477bb1257/317_280_4308_2587/master/4308.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c47f4ee441862d0ed0521f3a609ea53","title":"dame vera lynn a life in pictures","story":"Vera Lynn has died at the age of 103.

Some police officers have also done so at protests, and Premier League footballers and officials took the knee on Wednesday before the first games since the pause in the season caused by coronavirus.Speaking to talkRadio on Thursday, Raab was asked whether he would adopt the pose.

I understand this sense of frustration, of restlessness, which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement.“I’ve got say, on this take the knee thing – which, I don’t know, maybe it’s got a broader history but it seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones – feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination, rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel differently about it, so it’s a matter of personal choice.”It is not clear why Raab believed the pose came from Game of Thrones, the popular TV fantasy series.It began in 2016 when Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, opted to sit on the team bench rather than stand for the pre-NFL game rendition of the US national anthem, in protest against racism and police brutality.Kaepernick, who was joined by other players, later decided to pose on one knee, saying this made the same point while showing more respect to military veterans.Kaepernick’s actions led him to be frozen out of professional sport, and he was criticised from Donald Trump and others. He could now return to the NFL, with even Trump saying this would not be a problem for him.Asked whether he would take the knee to show solidarity with BLM, Raab said he would not, adding: “I’d take the knee for two people: the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me.”On the subject of his wife he added: “By the way, she disputes that. I had this conversation with her last night. I’m sure I did, but we’d obviously had too much champagne at the time. But I’m certain I did.”Raab’s comments prompted derision from some Labour MPs. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, tweeted: “This is not just insulting to the Black Lives Matter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab. He is supposed to be the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom.”Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, said: “‘Taking the knee began in 2016 with American athletes refusing to stand for US national anthem. They were protesting police brutality and racism. But Dominic Raab thinks it comes from Game of Thrones!!!”In his own later tweet, Raab said: “To be clear: I have full respect for the Black Lives Matter movement, and the issues driving them. If people wish to take a knee, that’s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice.”Raab’s Game of Thrones theory is not the first time he has expressed unusual views. In 2018, as Brexit secretary, he prompted criticism – and some mockery – for saying he had only recently appreciated the importance of the Dover-Calais crossing for UK trade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b143716c88576fcd713bd51766c974077eecb103/3175_2203_10517_6315/master/10517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6b8027eb6c91700715ac43e9bc4be44","title":"how to use music to boost your running whether over a mile or a marathon","story":"From music’s effects on fatigue to its motivational properties, the right soundtrack is a powerful tool for improving your ability to run wellEveryone knows there’s a link between music and running. Barely a gym lets a cross-training machine go unaccompanied by hi-NRG dance tunes. There’s a great choice of running playlists on Spotify, some with millions of likes from users who’ve found that the right music can push them farther and faster. Bruce Springsteen has even written a whole album about being born to run. But if you want to use music to help improve your running, it’s important to get to grips with the science, and how it applies to your running style.Given that most runners tend to follow a pace of 150 to 180 steps per minute, you need music that corresponds to that. One option is to pick music that has about 150-180bpm, so that you can match your steps to the beat. “Foo Fighters’ The Pretender, which has about 170bpm, is really, really popular with runners,” says Hallett.However, 150-180bpm is very fast in terms of tempo, so there’s relatively little recorded at those speeds – with the exception of more high-energy rock’n’roll, thrash metal or speed garage. So another option is to aim for music that matches your stride cycle – ie two steps rather than one. This lets you pick music that’s much slower. Something that’s particularly good? Hip-hop.One of the most pleasant ways to run is to do so in what’s known as a “flow state”. It’s a highly enjoyable feeling of being completely immersed in what you’re doing to the point where it’s as though you’re on autopilot, but which is in itself highly enjoyable. It’s also been shown to enhance running endurance.Karageorghis did a study where he ran people to exhaustion during a beep test and found that those who listened to music more easily entered flow state. But in order to enter flow state, it’s important to have the right listening experience. The more continuous the listening experience, the easier it is to enter flow state. So if you’re planning to go on a reasonably lengthy run, it’s best to avoid music with ads, and to ensure you’re not listening in a way that might be interrupted by poor signal. Using Spotify Premium, with ad-free music and offline listening, is one way to keep the flow state flowing, if you will. “Having interrupted music can be a little distracting and disconcerting – it’s not as beneficial as having continuous music,” says Karageorghis. “That’s why I often encourage people to create end-to-end playlists that contour their workout.”One of the most important ways that music can help take your running to the next level is by making you feel less tired when you exercise. When you’re listening to a soundtrack, you’re giving your brain something to process other than your physical activity. The music distracts it from focusing on the effect exercise is having on your body, so the parts of the brain that speak to each other to communicate fatigue are less able to do so – meaning you feel less exhausted than you otherwise would.“It’s as though the music takes up some of your brain’s bandwidth that would normally be used for communication with the working muscles and the organs,” says Karageorghis. “It limits the degree to which fatigue-related signals can enter conscious awareness.”One thing that is unaffected by how fast you’re running is music’s ability to make you feel like you’re enjoying yourself. Even at higher intensities, studies have found that music can make people enjoy exercise more than they otherwise would.Karageorghis has also found that not only does music enhance how pleasurable your run is, but it enhances your memory of your run. It makes you remember your runs more positively, associates them more with being positive experiences and increases your probability of running more frequently. As to the right type of music to ensure that your brain responds positively to running? That depends entirely on you.“It’s often to do with the personal associations that the music has for you,” says Hallett. “I had a participant who listened to music from their university days because it took them back to a time when they had less responsibility. Going on a run felt like a bit of escapism for them. Others were motivated by music that reminded them of people they knew. It depends what has meaning to you.”Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

Lelouch has returned behind the camera for a new version, with less mystique, F1 driver Charles Leclerc at the wheel, Ferrari, face coverings, elbow bumps and even Albert II, Prince of Monaco, on board. Stick with the classic, we reckon.

Fifa’s short film on the tournament delightfully evokes the women’s game’s pre-primetime era.4) But a quarter of a century is nothing: it’s 60 years today since Arnold Palmer’s sensational comeback at the US Open – he went into the final round seven strokes off the lead, but tore up Cherry Hills with a brilliant round of 65 to finish two clear of then-amateur Jack Nicklaus.

Molatham going well and now Monarch of Egypt coming ... they fight out the finish and Molatham kept a straight line and won while Monarch of Egypt drifted and threw it away after leading till close home. And that’s five for Jim Crowley!“Group horse in the making” was the tag immediately attached to King Leonidas when he won his second novice race at Newmarket 11 days ago, giving 7lb to some inexperienced rivals. This is a big step up in class and the market appears to be taking it as read that he will cope. His October win was on soft. Molatham beat Wichita at the Leger meeting and can be excused his Autumn Stakes flop, when a mile on soft was too much of a stretch at that stage for him. Monarch Of Egypt was ridden to track Siskin in the Irish Guineas at the weekend and immediately ran out of room when the winner made his move. In the circumstances, he may well be ready to go again just six days later and he got within a length of a Group One win last summer. Celestin was fourth at a big price in the French Guineas and this step back in trip may help. Le Brivido came from that race to win this in 2017. Rain would often be good news for a French raider and he won twice on heavy last year.They’re off ... Fox Tal and Forest Ranger get out of the stalls quickly ... with Forest Ranger now taking the lead ... Fox Tal is Keen ... Sir Dragonet towards the back ... Prince Eiji has moved much closer ... and takes it up ... Sir Dragonet stays on but it’s Mountain Angel who got first run and takes the prize.Matt Chapman has just told ITV Racing viewers that Highland Chief, the winner of the first race, may now go for the Derby!It’s still squelching at Royal Ascot ...Paul Cole, the trainer of the first winner today, has some record at Royal Ascot as Greg Wood reminds us.Those racing cliches always keep on coming and I’m going to keep a tally – “getting through the ground” is the first as the winning jockey told us after the first race there.This Listed contest is on its way to an upgrade, as its cast is again remarkably strong. Last year, Addeybb beat Magic Wand, Elarqam and Latrobe. This time, we have the Champion Stakes fourth (Fox Tal), the Eclipse third (Regal Reality) and a horse beaten less than a length in the Derby. The latter is clearly Sir Dragonet I have to frame it as “beaten less than a length” because saying he was fifth is less impressive. He has been repeatedly disappointing since Epsom and, although he needed his March run, it is not impossible that he will need this too. But the ground has come in his favour and lots of people are hoping to see a reprise of the Chester Vase. Fox Tal was having just his second run of the year behind Magical here in October, when the ground was also testing, and Andrew Balding’s lightly raced sort ought to be more of a force this year. Regal Reality got within three lengths of Enable at Sandown despite being fractious in the preliminaries, so there is a lot of ability there. His York fifth was less impressive, his latest win is more than a year ago and this rain has not helped him. John Gosden fields his Winter Derby winner, Dubai Warrior, though his sole run on turf was poor. Frankie Dettori will be on Crossed Baton, good enough for an ordinary Listed prize but possibly not this one. King Ottokar, third in a better race in this week last year, may have needed his reappearance run behind Lord North. Walkinthesand defied top weight in a July meeting handicap and has had excuses since. This morning’s rain is not good news for him and he was taken out of the Brigadier Gerard recently because of cut in the ground.They’re off ... Grand Rock was well away ... Yoshimi taken wide ... Tritonic is also prominent ... Global Storm in midfield ... Gallaside just behind the leaders ... Highland Chief and Tritonic kick on with Highland Chief getting the upper hand close home.Thought we might amuse ourselves at what Gold Cup day would look like if we had a crowd today in the rain ...It’s still persisting down at AscotHere’s another of those handicaps invented to give more opportunities (to professionals and punters) at this Royal Ascot, a 10-furlong event for three-year-olds. It’s not a long run from the start to the first bend, so a wide draw can be problematic, yet Acquitted in 15 will be well fancied. He put up a big effort in defeat to the classy Palace Pier a dozen days ago and that attracted attention, but his mark has been raised and there are plenty of unexposed types with better draws. Global Storm is very slightly well in under his penalty for a win the day after Acquitted ran, when he beat Arthurian Fable, a close fifth here yesterday.Hypothetical’s fourth in the Classic Trial looks strong form in light of what Pyledriver and Berlin Tango have done but he faded after taking a strong hold that day and this is a stiffer test on a very different surface. HMS President probably needed his comeback fifth at Yarmouth and this well-related colt who once had a Derby entry could do better here. But the pick is Tritonic, who had Acquitted four lengths behind when he scored at Newbury in September, looking like a nice prospect for this year. He has possible excuses for his final run beyond the ground but will clearly need to cope better with a wet surface today.1.15pm Golden Gates Handicap3 Laser Show (Self Certificate, temperature)12 Dogged (Going)14 Cemhaan (Self Certificate, heat in leg) - replaced by reserve Bronze River who takes number 141.50pm Wolferton Stakes (Listed)1 Dubai Warrior (Going)16 Bubble And Squeak (Going)2.25pm Jersey Stakes (Group 3)3 Fleeting Prince (Going)3.00pm Chesham Stakes (Listed)8 Concessions (Self Certificate, Going)4.10pm Britannia Stakes (Heritage Handicap)10 Johan (Self Certificate, (blood analysis not normal)17 Grove Ferry (Vet’s Certificate, Lame)4.40pm Sandringham Stakes (Handicap)3 Festive Star (Going)7 Graceful Magic (Going)Chris Stickels, Clerk of the Course at Ascot, says: “We have now had 16 millimetres of rain since racing finished on Wednesday and I have changed the going to Soft all over. The Straight Course is walking quite well, but this moisture is really starting to get properly into it now.”“We have fresh ground on the Round Course from nine furlongs out today, and the Straight Course has taken the racing really well so far this week, it is simply the volume of rain we have received that is now really getting into it.”“Low pressure has been circling us for the last seven or eight days and the weather has been difficult to predict. It does look like it should settle down for Friday and Saturday, with the chance of occasional showers. Once we are through today, we should be over the worst of it, although the risk of showers cropping up on Friday and Saturday remains.”There has now been 15mm of rain since last night and with the precipitation still persisting, the clerk of the course has returned from his walk of the track, taken his wellies off and declared the going to be ‘soft’. As our chief tipster Chris Cook warned in a tweet earlier today it may ride ‘heavy’ in places out there so adjust your betting accordingly.John Gosden 3 winsAidan O’Brien 2Charlie Hills 1Roger Varian 1William Muir 1Mark Johnston 1Andrew Balding 1Owen Burrows 1Richard Hannon 1Alan King 1William Knight 1This is already the fourth best Royal Ascot of Gosden’s career and of course he’s odds-on to add to his tally today, thanks to Straarius in the Gold Cup. He has nine other runners, including the favourites for the Jersey and the Sandringham. Meanwhile, O’Brien has four confined to three races, although it would be no great surprise if he won all three. The Irishman will have a stronger hand on Friday and Saturday. William Haggas is having his patience stretched, as half of his six Ascot runners so far have finished second.Newsflash: going now officially soft at Royal Ascot. More details soon.Jim Crowley 4 winsJames Doyle 2Ryan Moore 2Frankie Dettori 1Andrea Atzeni 1Oisin Murphy 1Martin Dwyer 1William Buick 1Thore Hammer Hansen 1After a brilliant opening day, Crowley got another win aboard Hukum yesterday. It’s already been an excellent week for him, considering he’s only had nine rides in total at Ascot and one of the losers was Maydanny, first home on the wrong side in the Silver Hunt Cup.James Doyle had the biggest Wednesday, bagging the Prince of Wales as well as a win in the Queen’s colours, while Oisin Murphy and Andrea Atzeni got themselves on the podium. Meanwhile, Frankie Dettori has had a few frustrations since the exhilaration of Frankly Darling, being on the wrong Gosden runner in yesterday’s big race and getting done on the line aboard First Receiver. His chance of being top jockey this week has halved since Tuesday morning, according to the betting.1.15pm Golden Gates HandicapTritonic 15-21.50pm Wolferton StakesWalkinthesand (nb) 40-12.25pm Jersey StakesMonarch Of Egypt 9-23.00pm Chesham StakesBattleground 5-23.35pm Gold CupMoonlight Spirit 9-14.10 Britannia HandicapGreat Ambassador (nap) 12-14.40pm Sandringham HandicapAfrican Dream 7-4Annoyingly, the price has crashed in the past 24 hours about Great Ambassador, who was a 20-1 shot at 4pm on Wednesday!

The guide prices are 2-1 Purple, 3-1 Green, 4-1 Blue, 6-1 Red 8-1 White, Grey and Black, 10-1 Orange, 25-1 Union Jack and 33-1 No Hat. We’ll have the result soon after ITV Racing are out of the stalls at 1.30pm!There was some precipitation at the meeting in 1971 ... when Rock Roi won (this Pathe newsreel is a hoot) the Gold Cup but was later disqualified after failing a dope test.There’s nothing like a bit of rain to send betting markets into turmoil and punters seem certain the 13mm that fell on Ascot this morning has made the Gold Cup more competitive. Technician, an 11-2 shot overnight, has shortened to a best price of 100-30 while Straarius has gone the other way, from 4-7 to 5-6, despite having some top-class form to his name on soft.There have been interesting movements in the other round-course races, with Global Storm, a winner on heavy last year, going favourite for the opening handicap. And of course this is very much Sir Dragonet weather, the Irish raider having never looked so good as when sluicing through the Chester mud in spring last year. He’s taken over at the top of the betting for our second race, the Wolferton, and while some of that support will be the result of a ‘Pricewise’ tip in the Racing Post, he has tightened from 11-4 to 9-4 since 8.30am. The effect of the rain will probably be less on the straight course but it’s interesting to see some opposition to the supposed handicap ‘good thing’ in the last, African Dream, whose ability to cope with soft must be taken on trust. Waliyak, who put up a big effort on heavy last year, is 13-2 from 10-1 since last night.There will be a further update on the going at Ascot after Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, has walked the track again at around 10.30, but it was still raining when he recorded his first report at 8.30am, which arrived on Ascot’s Twitter feed a few minutes ago.“We’ve had 11m of rain since racing yesterday and it’s now about 8.30 in the morning,” Stickels said, “and the going has changed to good-to-soft. It’s still raining lightly so it will possibly go to good-to-soft, soft in places on the round course. We’ll update when I walk the course again at around 10.30 to 11.00.“The forecast is for further possible showers today and then tomorrow and Saturday look like two drier days with only the occasional risk of a shower.”John Gosden, meanwhile, has been on ITV’s Opening Show to confirm – as only he can – that Straarius will definitely line up for the Gold Cup despite the softening ground.“There’s little you can do about it but he loves to cruise … on fast summer ground and then put in that electrifying turn of foot which deals with his opponents,” Gosden said. “I think it’s a bit what Muhammad Ali said, he won’t be able to float like a butterfly and sting like a bee today, I’m afraid with the ground, it’s more likely to be rope-a-dope.Congratulations to melonk who won Wednesday’s competition ... for the second year in a row! The Talking Horses veteran had both the 12-1 shots that scored yesterday, Sir Busker and Hukum, for a final score of 19. That was impressive but not quite so good as 12 months ago, when melonk’s winners were Raffle Prize (18-1), Southern Hills (7-1) and Dashing Willoughby (6-1). BraileyC went close yesterday on +16.33, while MISTERCHESTER had three winners for +12.Please post your tips or racing-related comments below.The rainclouds that threatened but largely failed to deliver on Tuesday and Wednesday finally dumped some serious rain on Ascot after racing yesterday, and the effect on Straarius’s price to become only the third horse in history to win the Gold Cup three times has been dramatic.So far, the course has taken 13.2mm of rain since midnight, more than enough to change the official going to good-to-soft all over with every chance of further deterioration as the day goes on. That is very bad news for backers of Straarius, who remains odds-on for today’s feature race – but only just.It’s true that the ground was officially soft, good-to-soft in places when Straarius won his second Gold Cup last year, with a GoingStick reading of 7 on the straight course and 5.7 on the round course before racing, but it was drying all the time (and changed to good-to-soft all over after the Gold Cup).The GoingStick readings today are almost identical (7 and 5.5, slightly softer than 2019, respectively) but heading down. By race time, the going is likely to be very similar to the ground on which Straarius’s 10-race winning streak was snapped by Kew Gardens on Champions Day last year.Having been priced up at around 4-7 by most major firms this morning, Straarius is now available at 5-6 with Bet365, in the face of strong support for Martin Meade’s four-year-old Technician, who took the Group One Prix Royal-Oak on heavy ground at Longchamp in October. Oisin Murphy’s mount is now top-priced at 100-30, having been available at 5-1 overnight.Straarius’s win last year was, memorably, Frankie Dettori’s fourth straight winner on the card, and he was only just touched off in the fifth. Having peered into the abyss of a six-timer, bookmakers are likely to be wary of his mounts again today, all but one of which sits in the first three in the betting.Dettori, with one winner so far, needs this to be a moving day if he is to retain the top jockey title he won last year for the first time since 2004. He is now a 3-1 chance for the prize, behind Jim Crowley (2-1), who added another winner yesterday to stand on four, and Ryan Moore (2), the 6-4 favourite. James Doyle, also on two winners, is 10-1. Chris Cook’s selections for the third day are here, and the action is underway at 1.15."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a5950982191f0a59d48bade3fd9042c7b793658/0_0_8661_5197/master/8661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5273094ff165d429ebd46977fe7f21db","title":"end of tourism coronavirus pandemic travel industry","story":"The pandemic has devastated global tourism, and many will say ‘good riddance’ to overcrowded cities and rubbish-strewn natural wonders. Is there any way to reinvent an industry that does so much damage? By  Christopher de BellaigueOf all the calamities that befell tourists as the coronavirus took hold, those involving cruise ships stood apart. Contagion at sea inspired a special horror, as pleasure palaces turned into prison hulks, and rumours of infection on board spread between fetid cabins via WhatsApp. Trapped in close proximity to their fellow passengers, holidaymakers experienced the distress of being both victims and agents of infection, as a succession of ports refused them entry.When it began, the deadly situation at sea was seen as a freakish outgrowth of what many still thought of as a Chinese problem. The first ship to suffer a major outbreak was the Diamond Princess. By mid-February, 355 cases had been confirmed aboard, and the ship was held being in quarantine in the port of Yokohama. At the time, the ship accounted for more than half of reported cases outside China. Fourteen passengers on the Diamond Princess would die of the virus.The nightmare at sea has not concluded. Even after passengers from more than 30 afflicted cruise ships were allowed to disembark, and flooded into hospitals, quarantine hotels or on to charter flights home, an estimated 100,000 crew and staff remained trapped at sea, some in quarantine, others blocked from disembarking until their employers could make onward travel arrangements. This second drama led to a mass hunger strike – by 15 Romanian crew in limbo off the coast of Florida – and a police intervention to quell disturbances on a ship quarantined in the German port of Cuxhaven. As recently as 1 June, crew and staff aboard 20-odd cruise ships marooned in Manila Bay were reportedly clamouring to be allowed ashore.Cruises have become a symbol of the ravages that coronavirus has inflicted on tourism. A sector that until January was worth $150bn, by its own estimate, is shedding jobs, issuing debt and discounting furiously simply to survive. But even before the current crisis hit, cruising had become symptomatic of the damage that tourism wreaks on the world.Tourism is an unusual industry in that the assets it monetises – a view, a reef, a cathedral – do not belong to it. The world’s dominant cruise companies – Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian – pay little towards the upkeep of the public goods they live off. By incorporating themselves in overseas tax havens with benign environmental and labour laws – respectively Panama, Liberia and Bermuda – cruising’s big three, which account for three-quarters of the industry, get to enjoy low taxes and avoid much irksome regulation, while polluting the air and sea, eroding coastlines and pouring tens of millions of people into picturesque ports of call that often cannot cope with them.The virus has given us a picture, at once frightening and beautiful, of a world without tourism. We see now what happens to our public goods when tourists aren’t clustering to exploit them. Shorelines enjoy a respite from the erosion caused by cruise ships the size of canyons. Walkers stuck at home cannot litter mountainsides. Intricate culinary cultures are no longer menaced by triangles of defrosted pizza. It is hard to imagine a better illustration of tourism’s effects than our current holiday away from it.As tourism’s impact on the world has deepened, so the global economy has come to depend on it. Now, after the freeze forced upon foreign travel – unimaginable even six months ago – we have a rare opportunity to extract ourselves from this destructive cycle, and do things differently.To accusations that it is spoiling the planet, the tourism industry responds with an economic argument: one in 10 jobs in the world depend on it. Governments tend to like tourism, because it creates jobs in the time it takes a hotel to open and the hot water to come on – and it brings in plenty of foreign money.One industry advocate I spoke to quoted Lelei Lelaulu, a development entrepreneur who, in 2007, described tourism as “the largest voluntary transfer of cash from the rich to the poor, the ‘haves’ to ‘have nots’, in history”. Even if one allows for considerable “leakage” – whereby much of tourists’ expenditure doesn’t go to the destination country but to foreign tour agencies, airlines and hotel chains whose services they use – it cannot be denied that Australians have spent liberally in Bali, Americans in Cancún and Chinese in Bangkok.For all the money the industry usually brings in, one of the prices of allowing a place to be taken over by tourism is the way it distorts local development. Farmers sell their land to the hotel chain, only for the price of crops they once grew to inflate beyond their reach. Water is erted to the golf course while the locals go short. The road is paved as far as the theme park, not the school. In its subordination of an economy to a powerful, capricious, external motor, tourism dependency has something in common with the aid dependency that I observed as a reporter in Afghanistan after the 2001 invasion. In both cases, the worst threat is the possibility of sudden withdrawal.Biggs Bradley pointed to a number of “small, vulnerable” places that will be devastated, such as those islands in the Pacific that have recently become popular with ing tour operators. “They were opened up by the phenomenal rise in new air routes of recent years,” she said, only for the planes to stop arriving, leaving debt and unemployment behind.Tsotne Japaridze, whose tour agency Traffic Travel organises adventure holidays in Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, described the pain that the virus inflicted on his business and those who rely on it. Japaridze employs three people full-time, hires 15 guides and drivers during the summer season, and sends tour groups to 30-odd vineyards, guesthouses and private houses around the country. His company can be seen as a powerful core diffusing revenue that supports hundreds of people. At the start of the crisis, Japaridze put his employees on unpaid leave (“It was a difficult decision but I had no option,” he said). As tourism vanished, demand has exploded for services that do not require customers to leave their homes. One of Japaridze’s former guides, who used to take tour groups to the beautiful Svaneti region of Georgia, is now making ends meet by delivering food on his motorbike.If one danger of tourism dependency is that the tourists might suddenly stop arriving, a more common problem is overtourism – the saturation of a destination by visitors in numbers it cannot sustain. Near the peak of the pandemic, I spoke by Zoom to Jane da Mosto, whose NGO, We Are Here Venice, fights valiantly to keep the most noxiously over-touristed place on earth a tolerable place to live.While chopping vegetables for the family supper, Da Mosto confessed to a certain unease at the juxtaposition of apocalypse in Italian hospitals and the scenes of serenity and quiet observable from her window. The bridges were empty and seahorses cavorted in the Grand Canal, while peddlers of phallic-shaped pasta had been replaced by boatmen delivering homemade tortellini to the city’s residents.When Da Mosto moved out of view to attend to her potatoes, her place was occupied by her 19-year-old son, Pierangelo. From the day he first slid behind the wheel of his father’s boat, Pierangelo has lived for the water, and he feels queasy if obliged to sit in a car. He works as a carpenter and a restorer of the city’s famous keel-less boats, while also beetling about on an electric launch and showing tourists “Venice from a Venetian perspective”.A Venetian who acknowledges the importance of tourism but longs to relax its grip, Pierangelo and his friends – designers, students, fellow carpenters – had been discussing life after the virus, when, with fewer visitors, they would be faced with a steep drop in income, and would be obliged to make up the shortfall by drumming up business from local residents.And how, I asked, does he feel when he’s bobbing on the Giudecca Canal and turns to see a cruise ship bearing down on him?Were it not for tourism, much of Venice’s Gothic fabric would have crumbled or been redeveloped years ago. But while the tourism industry provided much of the economic rationale for the preservation of the city’s architecture provided the economic rationale for visitors, power was handed to investors in hotels, restaurants and boats, many of them outsiders for whom Venice was simply a business opportunity. On 15 July 1989, the global music industry commandeered the city for a free concert, the memory of which vexes Venetians even now. As many as 200,000 people from all over Europe converged that day on the Piazza San Marco, the city’s spiritual and aesthetic core, some of them packed on to boats offshore, to see Pink Floyd on the final leg of their world tour.Panicky city councillors argued almost until the opening note of Shine on You Crazy Diamond about whether the concert should go ahead. In the end, the band agreed to lower the decibels and shorten their playlist to fit global TV schedules (Italian national broadcaster Rai did very nicely), while shopkeepers around the square sold warm beer at triple the price to fans who discovered too late that the authorities hadn’t laid on a single toilet. The following morning, the famous old flagstones were covered by cans, cigarette butts and puddles of urine.As an example of tourism squatting on the public good, an invasion of a medieval city centre by 200,000 people who pay no entry fee and leave the city to clear up their mess is hard to beat. One Italian TV report described the concert as a violation of human rights, “those of the invaders and those of the invaded”. So virulent was criticism of the city council that its members resigned en masse.Long before the invasion by rock fans, residents had been deserting the city. Between 1950 and 2019, Venice’s population dropped from about 180,000 to nearer 50,000, while the number of annual visitors rose from 1 million to 30 million. According to Jan van der Borg, a tourism specialist who teaches at Venice’s Ca’ Foscari University, and advises tourism authorities across Europe, this exceeds the city’s “carrying capacity”, the number it can accommodate without permanently damaging its infrastructure and way of life, by at least 10 million.Whether it is a gondola owner who lives far away and deputes someone else to row tourists through the packed canals, or the budget airlines that deposit thousands of tourists every day in an area barely one and a half times the size of New York’s Central Park, in Da Mosto’s words, “a huge number of people live off Venice without living in it”.According to the unapologetic elitism that informs the thinking of Van der Borg and other industry strategists, “high-impact, low-value” excursionists should be made less welcome than the affluent independent travellers who stay in a hotel, eat at neighbourhood restaurants and perhaps round off a day in the city’s lesser-known churches with a bellini at Harry’s Bar – like Truman Capote before them. At every step, runs this line of reasoning, “quality” tourists contribute to the city’s wellbeing through taxes, tips and human interaction.So is the package holiday on the way out? According to a UK trend report by Abta in 2019, people considering their next holiday abroad were looking, above all, to spend less. If the budget holidaymaker is to be given a lukewarm welcome, British tourists have not got the hint.In the past 10 years, the curse of “Venetianisation” – the hollowing out of a place, as it fills with tourist-termites – has beset city after city, as budget airlines and Airbnb have brought a weekend somewhere cobbled within reach of millions. That hasn’t just meant long-established destinations such as Venice or Paris, but sleepy coastal towns such as Porto, on Portugal’s Atlantic coast, that were completely unprepared for the numbers of tourists unleashed on them.The fightback can be dated to July 2015, when the city council in Barcelona – whose famous promenade, La Rambla, had been rendered all but impassable by the sheer number of tourists – introduced a moratorium on new hotels. The following year Airbnb was served a €600,000 fine for listing unlicensed properties – small beer for a company whose revenues from a single quarter have been known to exceed $1bn, but a sign of growing hostility towards an industry that could make a city unrecognisable to its residents in a short space of time.There is, of course, a financial cost to limiting tourism. As Fermín Villar, the president of the Friends of La Rambla, which represents the street’s residential and commercial interests, told the  two years ago, “La Rambla is above all a business … every year more than 100 million people walk along this street. Imagine,” he enthused, “if each person spends only €1.” But mass tourism displaces other businesses, while the exodus of many creative and productive residents, as well as the stress placed on local infrastructure by visitors in such numbers, carry a cost of their own. Da Mosto told me that, in purely economic terms, Venice is a net loser from an industry that has set up shop on its premises and remits much of its revenues elsewhere.A certain nimbleness is required of companies that make money out of tourism but do not want to be seen as blind to its effects. The guide book publisher Fodor’s issues an annual “no list” of destinations that people should altruistically abstain from visiting. This year’s list features Easter Island and the Cambodian temple complex of Angkor Wat. Meanwhile Fodor’s also promotes “twenty-five places to see in the US before you die”. That list includes Big Sur, a stretch of Californian coastline that was recently festooned with a banner reading “Overtourism is killing Big Sur”.Gazing at the distant profile of Mount Kenya from lightly chlorinated water in the African bush might seem like a bearable way to sit out the crisis, but the infinity pool at the Loisaba tented camp, one of three safari lodges in a 23,000-hectare reserve of the same name, hasn’t seen a swimmer in months. Less than a month after flights into the country were suspended on 25 March, Loisaba’s CEO, a Kenyan veteran of bush tourism called Tom Silvester, told me that he had laid off 90 employees, “and with each job around here carrying up to 10 dependents, that’s a big impact”.The damage done by the collapse of Kenya’s tourism industry, which is worth $1.6bn and employs 1.6 million people, is fearsome. After shuttering 24 properties across east Africa, Elewana, the hotel company that operates Loisaba’s three lodges, is drawing on cash reserves to support its 2,000-odd employees and their families. The website of another reserve, the Nashulai, is emblazoned with a plea for donations to combat starvation among the communities that rely on it.While in many places getting rid of tourists may be the only way to restore a healthy natural world, in countries where the tourist industry focuses on the environment, the opposite may be true. When I suggested to Karim Wissanji, Elewana’s CEO, that the best way to conserve Africa’s wildlife might be for human beings to migrate to the cities and leave them in peace, he retorted: “The future of our wildlife and their habitats are intrinsically linked to the future of the safari adventure industry.”Three-quarters of the 2 million foreign tourists who came to Kenya last year came for the wildlife. Were it not for tourism, many of the 160 private reserves that provide vital corridors for migrating animals and excess grazing capacity for the country’s national parks would revert to being hunting grounds or be turned over for agriculture, threatening one of the greatest concentrations of animal life in the world. Competition for grazing land, especially during times of drought, has intensified long-standing conflict between the needs of local communities and the region’s unique wildlife. As Paula Kahumbu, the CEO of conservation organisation Wildlife Direct, wrote in the , “most Kenyan youth see wildlife as irrelevant, something that benefits a few, rich visitors or white landowners”. In the wake of violent incursions on ranches and wildlife parks over the years, safari outfits have looked for ways to make tourism directly support the local population.The loss of incomes caused by the pandemic might yet precipitate disaster. On 21 April, Conservation International, a US charity that protects areas of exceptional bioersity, reported that there has been an “alarming rise in bushmeat and ivory poaching in Kenya”. Loisaba has only been able to maintain its anti-poaching patrols thanks to a donation from The Nature Conservancy, another charity that funds and gives scientific advice for conservation projects around the world.For all the money that foreigners bring to Loisaba, the reserve lacks the ersity of clientele that is an ingredient of the most resilient tourist businesses. Bush tourism in general is attracting too few of Kenya’s growing middle class – while the high cost of living keeps many at home, those who do travel for holidays tend to head for the coast.Now that the country’s borders are shut and rich foreign tourists won’t be back for months, a new conservation strategy will be needed. From an environmental point of view, the immediate peril is that the great apes catch coronavirus. The longer-term challenge is to protect them from a rise in poaching for gorilla meat, and from getting caught in snares laid for antelopes.Covid-19 has exposed the flaw in the model of elite tourism with a conscience. There is no plan B.Among the nations that have, in recent years, tried to build up wildlife tourism is Indonesia, home to the world’s largest lizard, the Komodo dragon. Last year, the government announced a plan to make the town of Labuan Bajo, which is currently the access point for Komodo national park’s numerous islands, into one of 10 major tourism destinations. Ominously, the government scheme is called “10 new Balis”.The idea isn’t to ease pressure on the over-touristed island of Bali, for which a major new airport is planned, but to emulate its success at attracting millions of tourists on cut-price holidays every year. In the process, Bali’s combination of heaving beaches, growing water shortages and mountains of rubbish may also be replicated at the 10 other destinations. “What was once a small fishing village is now supercharged with boom-town zeal and non-stop construction of restaurants and hotels,” reported a CNBC correspondent visiting Labuan Bajo in January.Between 2008 and 2018, the annual number of visitors to Komodo national park increased from 44,000 to 176,000. One big attraction, apart from the nature itself, is the price. After your $50 flight from Bali lands at Labuan Bajo’s new airport, I was told by Glenn Wappett, a former British serviceman who skippers yachts around eastern Indonesia, “you can stay in a hostel and take a day boat to see the dragons and still get change from $100”. That includes the roughly $12 park entry fee. Lonely Planet named the island chain that includes Komodo its “best-value destination” for 2020. (That was before the guidebook publisher was hit by the global lockdown and suspended most of its commercial activities in April.)Indonesia’s preference for mass over elite tourism has been guided by the addition of 2 million young people to the labour market each year. More tourists means more jobs. After all, even if their per-capita outlay is low, large numbers of visitors need more waiters, taxi drivers and marine guides than a handful of extravagant ones.But as visitor numbers to the islands have risen, the dragon population has fallen. Mating practices were disrupted by tourists, while deer poaching depleted their main food source and logging destroyed their habitat. In 2018, Viktor Bungtilu Laiskodat, the governor of the province of East Nusa Tenggara, in which the park lies, advocated increasing the entrance fee to $500 with the aim of attracting richer tourists, reducing visitor numbers and protecting the lizards. In March 2019, after smugglers stole more than 40 Komodo dragons, his administration went a step further and announced that the island of Komodo, home to around 1,700 giant lizards, would close for the whole of 2020 to allow the reptiles, the deer they feed on and their shared habitat, to recuperate.But the governor’s attempts at conserving the region’s main attraction went down badly with many of the locals who make a living from tourism. “There was a huge backlash from e companies, hotels and restaurants,” recalled Wappett. They demanded that tourists be allowed on Komodo, and in October, the national government overruled the governor and the plan was scrapped.The virus is succeeding where the governor of East Nusa Tenggara failed. Entry to the Komodo National Park has been barred to all but the fishing communities that inhabit it. The dragons sup on venison and fish, which, according to Wappett’s friends in the area, have returned in spectacular numbers to these overvisited waters.Still, it’s not hard to imagine what will happen once tourism becomes feasible again. On 14 April, Indonesia’s finance minister predicted that coronavirus, by freezing the tourist trade, could leave as many as 5.2 million Indonesians unemployed. Unless some alternative path for job creation can be found in the future, as soon as flights resume, tourists will be encouraged to return en masse and the dragons will once again come under threat.On 7 May, the UN World Tourism Organisation suggested that the coronavirus crisis would squeeze the industry so hard that progress towards making tourism sustainable – principally by reducing overcrowding and addressing climate change – would be not just halted but reversed. Indeed, since the start of the crisis, airlines and cruise companies have been lobbying hard for tax breaks and the lifting of environmental measures.Destructive though it is, the virus has offered us the opportunity to imagine a different world – one in which we start decarbonising, and staying local. The absence of tourism has forced us to consider ways in which the industry can ersify, indigenise and reduce its dependency on the all-singing, all-dancing carbon disaster that is global aviation.For Komodo in Indonesia the alternative ending involves fewer visitors paying more to visit the national park while the surrounding communities develop the fishing and textile industries that have kept them going for centuries. In Georgia’s Svaneti region, where the lure of tourist dollars has drawn people to abandon animal husbandry in favour of opening guesthouses and cafes, Tsotne Japaridze told me the crisis could be a “lesson not to forget their traditional means of making a living”.More broadly, tourism must be valued not as a quickfire source of foreign exchange, but as an integrated part of a nation’s economy, subject to the same forward planning and cost-benefit analysis as any other sector. In places where tourism is too dominant, it needs to shrink. All this needs to happen in tandem with wider efforts to decarbonise society.As an international industry, tourism means nothing less than the aggregate of activities that range from building airline engines at Rolls-Royce’s plant in Derbyshire to pulling pints in the Irish pub in Montego Bay. From this global perspective, it cannot easily be planned or controlled. Its natural bosses are municipal, provincial and national governments, and it is to these institutions that responsibility for reform now falls. Some have already begun. The council in Barcelona, for example, reclaimed parts of town that had been lost to holiday lets the governor of East Nusa Tenggara tried to price the Komodo Dragon out of danger. Such instincts to tame tourism’s excesses through taxes and pricing need to be adopted everywhere. Tourism isn’t the right that many holidaymakers, whatever their budgets, seem to think it is. It’s a luxury that needs to pay its way. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a14c9773c799b2077ad3a9c46020ae2b971f647/0_58_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=890cc146677d6dec490173710d3f5324","title":"john logan penny dreadful gladiator writers dream freely","story":"The writer of Gladiator on the importance of ersity in the writers’ room and how LA’s history fuelled his new series, City of AngelsA city planning document might not seem like a promising place to find inspiration for a new season of a fantasy horror series – but John Logan, the Tony winning, Oscar-nominated writer of Gladiator and The Aviator has never been a typical Hollywood figure. Despite being LA born and bred, he isn’t one for the party lifestyle that some of his contemporaries in the industry enjoy. He doesn’t drink – “the idea of losing control is anathema to me” – and is at his happiest walking in the countryside around his house. “I’m joyously anonymous,” Logan says.And eschewing glamorous events means he has plenty of time to pore over a 1937 LA city council traffic study, from which the idea for Penny Dreadful: City of Angels  sprang.Yet City of Angels is anything but dry –\u0026nbspa supernatural thriller circling around a Mexican-American family, a Nazi-sympathising German immigrant played by Rory Kinnear, and the battle between Santa Muerte – the guide of the dead – and her sister, the evil demoness Magda\u0026nbsp– played with stunning dexterity by Natalie Dormer in a number of different guises as she hides among her mortal victims. So where do the freeways fit in?And yet, while the aim is no doubt noble, any attempt from a white writer to address issues of racial injustice is bound to attract some criticism, especially in writing characters of different ethnicities. It is an issue Logan has sympathy with, even as he dismisses the very notion of cultural appropriation. “I categorically reject the idea that artists cannot speak in voices other than their own,” Logan says emphatically. “The balkanisation of the imagination is a very, very dangerous thing. Writers and performers and singers have to be able to dream very freely. And sometimes that takes you to places away from yourself, otherwise we’re into a very anaemic and cannibalistic cultural landscape.“But having said that, verisimilitude is important. I didn’t pretend to be an expert on Mexican American culture. I brought experts in. I hired Latino writers and directors and production designers. My producing partner, Michael Aguilar, is Latino. And finally I went to José Rivera, a wonderful playwright and screenwriter, who wrote one of our episodes, and asked him to do a pass through all 10. Just to say what’s not authentic, what doesn’t ring true. So philosophically, I completely reject the idea of there being any such thing as cultural appropriation. But the practical matter as a responsible human being, you have to be careful and cautious and work.”Lest Trump-supporting Americans think they have an ally in the culture war, it’s worth considering Logan’s background. A gay man, brought up in the 1960s by strongly religious yet supportive parents, he has been horrified by the turn American politics has taken over the past five years. And while religion, and specifically Mexican folklore, is a huge part of his latest project, faith is not something he has ever embraced. “It presents very interesting opportunities for a heightened magical realism,” Logan explains. But as anything other than a storytelling device, Logan has little time for it.\u0026nbsp“I grew up with a very complicated view towards what religion is,” he says. “It was always fraught with social politics in my family. When people turn against science and facts, for faith, that’s a treacherous road. Faith and belief is a deep human need, but it’s not real in any objective sense as far as I’m concerned. Human beings have to accept the consequences of how they behave,. Any fig leaf that an established religion, or even a folklore religion, offers, is dangerous.”So with cultural appropriation and religion both dismissed, Logan is set for cancellation by all sides of America’s partisan politics.\u0026nbspIt was that deep sense of ision, of a country running out of control, that prompted his desire to look back at the past of his home city. “Like many people, I naively assumed that a sort of secular liberal humanism was the coin of the realm,” Logan says. “And then everything began to change, so, so shockingly. I felt helpless. And I wanted to say something about it as a writer. I was struck by the parallels between what I see going on in the world now, and what was happening in a very particular time in Los Angeles’ story.\u0026nbsp“You’re seeing a worldwide resurgence of dangerous political extremism, and atomistic nationalism and irresponsible political demagoguery. And in this country, a particularly virulent form of racism, demonisation of ethnic communities, the Mexican community. And all of that was very much in the air in late 30s in Los Angeles. Like many writers, starting with Shakespeare, the idea of examining the present through the lens of the past has always been something that really excited me.”Shakespeare often crops up in our conversation. Logan describes the first time he saw Laurence Olivier’s Hamlet as the “liminal event” of his life, which sparked a lifelong love of theatre, London and, perhaps surprisingly, drew him towards genre projects such as Star Trek (he wrote the 2002 film Star Trek: Nemesis, a dream come true as the TV series was his favourite show as a child), James Bond and Penny Dreadful – a CV one might not expect of a lauded playwright.\u0026nbsp“I was living in San Pedro, California, and my dad, who loves literature and was raised in Belfast on real poetry, made me sit down and watch a movie with him. And I didn’t want to do it, because who wants to sit with dad and watch a movie when it’s a nice Saturday and you wanna go out and play? But it was Olivier and Hamlet, and those two and a half hours changed my life.“On one hand, it has the genre elements that I loved – ghosts that were scary and the greatest sword fights ever put on screen – but it has this other thing. And that other thing was Shakespeare, the poetry and the character. And I became, at eight years old, obsessed with Shakespeare. It led me to the theatre and once I was in it, I suddenly knew the place I was meant to be my whole life, because I felt comfortable. I was an asthmatic child, I was gay. Our family moved all the time. So I didn’t have friends from childhood. But, doing a high-school show, I felt I had a tribe, and that has not changed from from that day.”Logan is worried about the future of theatre once the pandemic passes – but he is slightly more optimistic than most. “I look at history, when London theatres were closed repeatedly in the Jacobean era for plagues,” he says. “They always came back with incredible robustness. Creators and the audience are desperate for new stories and new interaction. Because what’s amazing about theatre and what I miss so desperately now is the art form, where everyone’s breathing in the same way, when everyone’s holding their breath at the same time. That to me is the most sacred moment I could possibly imagine. Film and TV are beautiful, but they’re zombie art forms. Once something is done, it exists that way, unchanging. What makes theatre so exciting is every performance is different.“Any event like this, that stops train of progress for a second and allows people to think about how they interact with their work with their family, with their loved ones and community, is an incredibly valuable thing,” he says. “We’ve learned something important about touch, about human interaction on a primal level. I hope it will make people more responsive to the occasional whisper and the occasional bit of poetry and the occasional walk outside for no reason without their iPhones.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3940ee2ed9dcc3b356369d49e1260ad983670dab/0_238_5426_3258/master/5426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c630da81f4dc272a842f60a493f90a0","title":"the great review this imperious catherine romp reaches for the tsars elle fanning","story":"Boo to historical accuracy. Hooray to the great comedy cast and script, and watching a ruthless young woman coming up on the inside laneThe Great opens with an asterisk. “The Great,” read the credits, “*an occasionally true story”. It sets the tone admirably. And also acts as a deterrent to all those who thought they might be settling down in front of a new 10-part series by Starzplay devoted to an AJP Taylor-esque exploration of 18th-century Russia and Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst’s rise to power from naive German bridal import to legendary empress Catherine the Great.Instead, this is the story of Empress Catherine (Elle Fanning) for those who found the Helen Mirren thing last year a bit too taxing. And for those who find The Tudors too lacking in jokes and The Borgias just … too bad. In short, most of us.We open in 1761, with aristocratic but impoverished but optimistic but naive young Soph sitting on a swing, regaling her friend with the news that she is soon to be married to Emperor Peter. “Of Russia?” says the friend. In real life, Catherine married the emperor (of Russia) in 1745 and by this point he was a year away from a coup d’etat. But again, if you are someone who already knows this and has been frothing since the beginning of the paragraph, this is not the satirical comedydrama series for you. Go and read a big book, it’s fine.Soon Sophie-known-as-Catherine-because-you-know-what-poshos-are-like is delivered to St Petersburg and Peter. He is played by Nicholas Hoult as Blackadder meets Tom Hulce’s Amadeus, and it’s brilliant. He inspects his blushing bride-to-be fiancee, who hands him a piece of evergreen spruce to symbolise their love. “She’s given me a twig,” he says, concerned, to his advisors. “She’s not another inbred, is she?” Reassured on this point, he resumes courtship. “You’re perfect,” he tells her. “Aristocratic but not powerful or a player. Your family, apparently, are fucked! … You smell funny. Is that usual?” “I’ve been travelling,” ventures his slightly discombobulated fiancee. “Let’s hope it’s that!” he replies, cheerfully, before heading off to hang with his bro-skis.The Archbishop (Adam Godley) tests her religious faith (“How is your relationship with the Lord Our God?” “We’ve had no trouble”) and her hymen and pronounces her fit for purpose. Which, despite Catherine’s love of books, education and all things European and progressive, is to bear heirs (“Let’s hope my seed has found purchase! I must empty myself into you again soon” says Peter, because egomaniacal hedonists are rarely much with the foreplay) and play boules on the lawn with the “cruel and vapid” ladies of the court until Peter’s sack fills again.Gradually Catherine finds a few friends and allies in the house of idiots: Marial (Phoebe Fox, and while I’m here – could we have more Phoebe Fox in our viewing lives, please?), a court lady with a brain but busted down to servant after her father incurred Peter’s wrath, and master strategist General Velementov – the butt of many of the emperor’s brutal practical jokes but whom he keeps around because, as Peter puts it: “He’s good at the thinking part of running the country.” As the mood and marriage darken, they are there to light her way to greatness.It is a romp, with every actor pitch-perfect in their role. Hoult has never been better, Fanning does a fantastic job as the Pollyanna with steel at her core, and Gwilym Lee as cuckolded Grigor Dymov hits his every scene out of the park. The script, adapted by Tony McNamara from his own play, shines – from the rapturous monologue in which Catherine imagines the pleasures of her forthcoming wedding night (“The man caresses you softly … your souls mesh … you fall into a black sky full of stars … end spent and unified!” “Ye-es,” says Marial. “That’s pretty much it”) to the throwaway gags scattered with a liberal hand.The whole is possibly slightly overlong – eight episodes might have done better, especially if they lost some of the more gratuitously violent scenes that occasionally overstep even the broad bounds set by its comic and satirical intentions. But it also offers oblique commentary on the dangers of letting a capricious, narcissistic, bullying man-child rule a nation – to say nothing of the sublime satisfaction of watching someone not just capable coming up on the inside lane but also ruthless enough and sufficiently free of the trappings of modern western democracy to install herself forthwith. I mean, I’m not saying Keir Starmer and Joe Biden should really stage a bilateral coup on both sides of the Atlantic. I’m just saying they could watch this and take a few notes, you know?

It is the first fatal confrontation since 1975 and the most serious since 1967, and so can be expected to have a powerful galvanising effect on the populations of both countries, already primed by a constant stream of nationalist rhetoric.There is a long history of such encounters ever since the two nations fought a short war there in 1962. After that conflict a Line of Actual Control (LAC) was declared, but there is no agreed line and limited control, as the events of recent weeks have confirmed. Thus far at least, both Indian and Chinese forces have stuck to an agreement not to carry firearms on patrol near the LAC.Beijing has put out a string of statements blaming India but giving no hint of Chinese casualties, estimated in the Indian press to total 43, including some deaths. In the past, such accounting has come decades later, if at all, from a regime that tightly controls information. For that reason, the only detailed accounts to have emerged so far have come from the Indian press.What is clear is that there will be more of these clashes without a clear change of direction and an attempt to agree on where the LAC should be, and how both sides should behave around it. Both Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping have built their images as warriors for national greatness.In his remarks on Wednesday, Modi warned the sacrifice of the soldiers would not be in vain and that India is capable of giving a “befitting reply” if provoked.China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, after speaking to his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Wednesday, issued his own warning, that India should not underestimate “China’s firm will to safeguard territorial sovereignty”.In the broadest terms the deadly brawl in the Galwan valley was the latest symptom of an increasingly aggressive Chinese policy on territory and borders, of the sort that has been playing out among the rocks and reefs of the South China Sea.Over the decades China has been more assertive than India in building infrastructure around the LAC, with roads and bunkers. In recent years, India has been trying to catch up, in particular with a road to the Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO), the highest airstrip in the world, with feeder roads leading off it. China has been trying to push back against that Indian construction work, so that its creeping occupation of the Galwan valley goes unchallenged.Since May, Chinese troops appear to have stopped their Indian counterparts from approaching areas where both sides have patrolled over the years. And Beijing has sent in reinforcements. What distinguishes the current confrontation from previous incidents is not just the death toll but the fact that there have been standoffs in multiple locations.“This kind of territory is incredibly hard to hold, but also to move multiple troops over,” said Tanvi Madan, director of the India project at the Brookings Institution. “So it’s not considered to be something that just happened on the ground. It’s clearly a decision made by the Chinese at a more senior level.”It is not just about bragging rights over crags. China has built a road, Highway 219, linking Tibet and Xinjiang, that passes through territory near the LAC that India considers its own. India’s foothold at the DBO airfield, on the other hand, allows its forces to look down at the Karakoram highway linking China and Pakistan.The timing of the incident may be connected to the weather. The melting snows of spring provide an opportunity for aggressive moves. The pandemic may also have played a role. It led to India putting off military exercises, and an extra motive for Beijing to look for distractions from its own failures in governance.The deadly clash happened at a time and a place where officers from both sides were trying to negotiate a disengagement of forces. Neither government wants this to escalate, and the foreign ministers on Wednesday agreed on resuming the disengagement process. But the fact that there has been significant loss of life, at least on the Indian side, makes the situation much harder to defuse.“Now domestic politics and public opinion, especially nationalist pressure to avenge their deaths and escalate, becomes a dangerous force,” Vipin Narang, a security studies professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said. “It will be hard for India at least, with a relatively open media, to de-escalate as easily now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ecf43ee0f1c8fc7a0532702506a81c97dd63bc/0_64_3316_1990/master/3316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba665edf1f54d9272aa5c46436b8e147","title":"fauci coronavirus covid 19 cases us","story":"America’s top public health expert has warned the nation it is “still in the first wave” of coronavirus infections and deaths, as six states report record numbers of new cases amid continued rapid easing of lockdown restrictions.Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, expressed worry about new hotspots for infections in major US states, while also advising that “personally, I would not” attend Donald Trump’s first political rally in months, due on Saturday, in Oklahoma, where vast crowds are expected despite rising Covid-19 cases.Arizona, Florida, Oklahoma, Oregon and Texas reported record increases in coronavirus cases on Tuesday, while Nevada recorded its highest ever number of single-day cases.In recent days North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama have reportedly set new highs in seven-day rolling average of Covid-19 cases, as many states have allowed some businesses and public spaces to reopen after months of restrictions.“As New York and other places are coming down, others are going up,” Fauci, who is also the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Boston Globe about different areas seeing decreases or increases in new cases.“Obviously, we’re concerned about it.”Fauci said he personally would choose not to attend such an event due to the risk of contracting coronavirus. And he warned that talk of whether the US was now experiencing a second wave of Covid-19 cases was premature.“We are seeing infections to a greater degree than they had previously seen in certain states, including states in the south-west and in the south,” Fauci told the Daily Beast. “I don’t like to talk about a second wave right now, because we haven’t gotten out of our first wave.”Oklahoma health officials are urging anyone attending the rally to get tested before arriving, and then to self-isolate afterwards and get tested again. People over 65 have been told to stay at home. The Trump election campaign will recommend the indoor audience wear masks, but is not going to mandate it.The Oklahoma governor, Kevin Stitt, a Republican, said officials would try to make sure the event was as safe as possible. “Ultimately, the president doesn’t ask for permission before he” goes to places, said Stitt on Wednesday.The mayor of Tulsa, GT Bynum, also a Republican, said he would not attend the rally.Vice-President Mike Pence has claimed the US has “slowed the spread”, and both Pence and the president have claimed the worrying increase in coronavirus cases is due to more testing.Fauci said this was not true.“When you look at the number of hospitalizations, and you see some of the states say, ‘Oh my goodness, I’m having more hospitalizations than I had before,’ that cannot be due to increase in testing. That has to be due to increase in real cases,” he told the Globe.Hospitalizations are continuing to rise in the states reporting infection increases.At Tucson medical center in Arizona on Monday, only one intensive care unit bed out of 20 was available. “Better contact your governor (quickly!)”In Florida, 260 workers at the Orlando international airport tested positive for coronavirus, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, said. DeSantis said almost 500 workers had been tested at the airport after two people contracted the virus.In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he would monitor the impact of the mass anti-racism protests the city has seen before allowing more businesses to reopen.“We’re all mindful we had a very unique situation with the protests,” De Blasio said on Wednesday, according to NBC News.In Oklahoma Trump supporters have been camping outside the rally venue for days, despite the risks.Tulsa residents and business owners were thwarted in their attempt to block the rally, which will take place at the indoor, 19,000-capacity BOK Center, on Tuesday. Residents had filed a lawsuit in an effort to have the rally cancelled, “to protect against a substantial, imminent, and deadly risk to the community”, but a judge refused the request.On Monday Trump – who has previously lied about the number of people at his rallies and events – said “almost 1 million people” had requested tickets for the event.Fauci has warned people against attending the rally, which had originally been planned for Friday, a date which marks the end of slavery in the US, before the Trump campaign switched the date amid widespread criticism.Asked if he would personally attend the campaign rally, Fauci said: “No.”“I’m in a high-risk category. Personally, I would not. Of course not,” he said. With regard to Trump’s rallies, Fauci said “outside is better than inside, no crowd is better than crowd” and “crowd is better than big crowd”.Tulsa’s chief public health officer, Bruce Dart, and the Tulsa World newspaper have urged Trump to cancel the rally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea83d0e5344cd58810caef54434dca3d6f7de043/0_134_4675_2805/master/4675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76e66f662007d7d4fe94820b2b4eeb76","title":"uk ministers order urgent vitamin d coronavirus review","story":"Exclusive: emerging evidence studied to see if ‘sunshine nutrient’ could lower Covid-19 riskPublic health officials are urgently reviewing the potential ability of vitamin D to reduce the risk of coronavirus.A delayed Public Health England review into the reasons why BAME people are disproportionately affected, which pointed to historical racism, did not review the role of diet and vitamin D.The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) began this work last month and is considering recent evidence on vitamin D and acute respiratory tract infection in the general population. Evidence will be considered on specific population groups, including those of different ages and BAME groups. In a parallel development, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) is conducting a “rapid” evidence review on vitamin D “in the context of Covid-19” with support from Public Health England (PHE).It is understood the reviews will be published in the coming weeks. The Nice review may be used alongside other available information, such as specific patient circumstances, to inform inidual healthcare decisions. Public Health Scotland and NHS boards are also assessing emerging evidence to see whether the so-called sunshine nutrient should be prescribed in hospitals and to high-risk groups to mitigate a second wave of Covid-19.Adrian Martineau, a professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London, welcomed the reviews and said deaths among BAME NHS staff had brought the question of vitamin D deficiency to the fore.“Vitamin D could almost be thought of as a designer drug for helping the body to handle viral respiratory infections,” he said. “It boosts the ability of cells to kill and resist viruses and simultaneously dampens down harmful inflammation, which is one of the big problems with Covid.”He is leading a national study collecting information about risk factors for Covid-19 with a focus on vitamin D deficiency to address the absence of research in this area. Any UK resident aged above 16 is eligible to participate.“There are no clinical trials of vitamin D to prevent Covid ongoing anywhere in the world to my knowledge and clinical evidence for its use to reduce risk of acute respiratory infections is mixed,” Martineau added.However, studies have suggested that vitamin D supplementation is safe and protects against acute respiratory tract infection. Higher levels of melanin in the skin lead to lower levels of vitamin D creation which are exacerbated in countries which have less sunlight. This can cause immune systems to be weaker.PHE has acknowledged reports about vitamin D potentially reducing the risk of coronavirus but said there was not enough evidence to support this.It has since April recommended all people take 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day to maintain bone and muscle health owing to concerns they may not be getting enough sunlight, particularly during the lockdown.UK vitamin D advice is focused on musculoskeletal health conditions such as rickets and there are fears that its effect on general immune systems has been overlooked. On 3 June the Scottish government specifically recommended people from minority ethnic groups with dark skin to take the supplement.Across the UK, as many as 750 NHS staff have received free wellness packs including liposomal vitamin C, vitamin D and zinc from a voluntary initiative called the Frontline Immune Support Team, and there has been some frustration that a more holistic approach to the pandemic has not been implemented.Singapore general hospital reportedly routinely gives coronavirus patients aged over 50 a mix of vitamin D, magnesium and vitamin B12, while countries which have recently had summers have generally been less affected by the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee81c0e3928a318bc62dbc3572bf52b6927bbce1/0_333_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e95d69c928c702300220ce3b28e02a5e","title":"contact tracers in england get no data from 26 of people with coronavirus","story":"Data for 4 to 10 June shows contact tracers were unable to get details from 1,435 who tested positiveA quarter of people who tested positive for Covid-19 have not shared the phone numbers or email addresses for those they have met with contact tracers, in the second week of the scheme’s operation, government figures show.The data for 4 to 10 June shows that fewer people with positive tests – just under 6,000 – were transferred to the contact tracing call centre teams and 4,366 of those were actually reached and asked for details of people they had spent time with in the past two days.The shadow health minister, Justin Madders, said: “Expert opinion shows that to defeat this virus we need a fully functioning test-and-trace system, so these latest figures are hugely worrying.“Having a quarter of those who test positive not contacted is a gaping hole in the system that urgently needs to be addressed. And questions still remain about how the app was hailed as a vital part of the system at the outset, but is now just the ‘cherry on the cake’.“Ministers need to level with the public about how they are going to tackle these real and serious issues as a matter of urgency.”Dido Harding, the executive chair of NHS Test and Trace, said the scheme was working to stop the spread of the virus “and undoubtedly helping to save lives”.“Building on our previous work, this week’s data shows that tens of thousands more people who may have otherwise unwittingly spread the virus are now remaining safely at home,” Lady Harding said.“Our efforts continue to reach more people who may be at risk of passing the virus on, and I am grateful for the support the public has already shown to protect those around them.

China has not disclosed whether its forces suffered any casualties.Responding to China’s claim to the valley, India’s external affairs ministry spokesman, Anurag Srivastava, said both sides had agreed to handle the situation responsibly. “Making exaggerated and untenable claims is contrary to this understanding,” he said in a statement.Both sides have accused each other of instigating the clash between their forces in the valley, part of the disputed Ladakh region along the Himalayan frontier.Media reports said senior army officers of the two sides met on Wednesday to defuse the situation, but there was no confirmation from either side.Indian security forces said neither side fired any shots, instead throwing rocks and trading blows. The Indian soldiers, including a colonel, died of severe injuries and exposure in the area’s sub-zero temperatures, the officials said.The clash escalated a standoff in the disputed region that began in early May, when Indian officials said Chinese soldiers crossed the boundary at three different points, erecting tents and guard posts and ignoring warnings to leave. That triggered shouting matches, stone-throwing and fistfights, much of it replayed on television news channels and social media.China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, warned New Delhi not to underestimate Beijing’s determination to safeguard what it considers its sovereign territory. His comments came in a phone call on Wednesday with his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.Wang said China demanded that India conduct a thorough investigation and “harshly punish” those responsible.“The Indian side would best not make an incorrect judgment of the situation, would best not underestimate China’s strong determination to safety its sovereign territory,” Wang said in a statement issued by the foreign ministry.He repeated China’s claims that India was solely responsible for the conflict, saying Indian forces had crossed the Line of Actual Control that ides the thousands of troops from both sides deployed in the area.Jaishankar, in turn, accused China of erecting a structure in the Galvan valley, which he called a “premeditated and planned action that was directly responsible for the resulting violence and casualties,” according to a statement.He added that the incident would have “serious repercussions” on India’s relationship with China, but that both sides were committed to further disengaging on the remote plateau of the Himalayan terrain.Indian prime minister Narendra Modi hailed the soldiers killed in the clashes. “Their sacrifices won’t go to waste,” he said. “For us, the unity and sovereignty of the country is the most important thing. India wants peace, but when provoked, it is capable of giving a fitting reply, be it any kind of situation.”While experts said the two nations were unlikely to head to war, they also believe easing tensions quickly will be difficult.Josep Borrell, a European Union vice president, urged both sides to show restraint and engage in military deescalation.“We express our deep regrets for the casualties incurred and offer our condolences to their loved ones,” the statement said. It called India and China both important partners of the EU and “crucial actors for regional and global stability.”China claims about 90,000 sq km (35,000 square miles) of territory in India’s northeast, while India says China occupies 38,000 sq km (15,000 square miles) of its territory in the Aksai Chin plateau in the Himalayas, a contiguous part of the Ladakh region.India unilaterally declared Ladakh a federal territory while separating it from disputed Kashmir in August 2019. China was among the handful of countries to strongly condemn the move, raising it at international forums including the U.N. Security Council.Thousands of soldiers on both sides have faced off over a month along a remote stretch of the 3,380km (2,100-mile) Line of Actual Control, the border established following a war between India and China in 1962 that resulted in an uneasy truce."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddffd522e954f1d834e2f0f680f02bd679bcee56/0_105_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5588911602602ef47fe4a2029396358","title":"lloyds of london and greene king to make slave trade reparations","story":"Firms will make payments to benefit the BAME community and promote ersityTwo major British firms have pledged to make payments to representatives of black people, as well as those of other minority ethnic backgrounds, as they seek to address their founders’ roles in the trans-Atlantic slave trade.The pub chain and brewer Greene King and the insurance market Lloyd’s of London both revealed on Wednesday evening that they would be making the reparations.The news, first reported by the , comes as people outraged by the killing of an African American man in Minnesota, George Floyd, as well as continuing racial discrimination closer to home, demand that the UK recognise the ongoing legacy of the British empire’s extensive role in the enslavement of millions of Africans.Records archived by researchers at University College London (UCL) show that one of Greene King’s founders, Benjamin Greene, held at least 231 human beings in slavery and became an enthusiastic supporter of the practice.When slavery was abolished in the British empire in 1833, the government agreed to pay compensation not to the enslaved people, but to the slaveholders.The records show Greene was given the equivalent of about £500,000 at today’s rate when he surrendered rights to plantations in Montserrat and Saint Kitts.He handed over control of his brewery to his son three years later and it was given its current name after a merger in 1887. Several of Greene’s descendants went on to hold prominent positions in British society, including a Bank of England governor, Conservative MP and BBC director general.“It is inexcusable that one of our founders profited from slavery and argued against its abolition in the 1800s,” said Nick Mackenzie, Greene King’s chief executive officer on Wednesday.“We don’t have all the answers, so that is why we are taking time to listen and learn from all the voices, including our team members and charity partners as we strengthen our ersity and inclusion work.”MacKenzie added that the firm will “make a substantial investment to benefit the BAME community and support our race ersity in the business”. He added that the firm now employs people “across the UK from all backgrounds”, adding that “racism and discrimination have no place at Greene King”.Lloyd’s of London said it would “invest in positive programmes to attract, retain and develop black and minority ethnic talent”, as well as providing “financial support to charities and organisations promoting opportunity and inclusion for black and minority ethnic groups”.A spokesman said Lloyd’s was in the process of identifying suitable groups, while Greene King is understood to be consulting on which would be most appropriate. Neither firm was able to say on Wednesday evening how much money they intended to pay in charitable donations or investments in relevant schemes.The UCL records show that Simon Fraser, a founder subscriber member of Lloyd’s, held at least 162 people in slavery and was paid the equivalent of nearly £400,000 at today’s rate for ceding a plantation in Dominica, while yet more were held at a site in British Guiana researchers believe either belonged to him or to his son.“Lloyd’s has a long and rich history dating back over 330 years, but there are some aspects of our history that we are not proud of. In particular, we are sorry for the role played by the Lloyd’s market in the eighteenth and nineteenth century slave trade. This was an appalling and shameful period of English history, as well as our own, and we condemn the indefensible wrongdoing that occurred during this period,” a spokesman said on Wednesday.The firm said it wanted to both acknowledge its history and identify what it could do to foster a more inclusive culture in the present. Besides the investments, it said it intended to provide education and research, as well as reviewing its “organisational artefacts to ensure that they are explicitly non-racist”.The spokesman added: “We are grateful to our black and minority ethnic colleagues who have helped to shape our conversations and actions to ensure that we create an environment free from injustice for them and for all. Our commitment is that we will continue to listen and learn as we act and to measure our progress.“There is a long way to go but we are determined that we can and will create a culture in the Lloyd’s market in which everybody can flourish.”Records show that, far from a system involving a few wealthy slaveholders, many ordinary Britons benefited directly from fairly small stakes in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, while the country in general grew rich as a result of its proceeds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b950270102b70c01824fa14758e47ff459414473/0_34_4032_2420/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b2bd01ba78fe51dc8aefb9f668911e7","title":"uk poised to abandon coronavirus app in favour of apple and google models","story":"Government will switch to contact-tracing model preferred by smartphone giants in latest embarrassing U-turnThe UK is poised to announce it has abandoned its attempt to build a centralised coronavirus contact-tracing app and will instead switch to the model preferred by the technology firms Apple and Google.The embarrassing U-turn comes after British officials concluded it was technically impossible to create an effective app that did not conform to the Google and Apple model, but that a straight switch to their model would not solve all the problems.They said there were also significant problems with the Google–Apple approach and they hoped to find a “third way” by working with the two firms to create a tracing app that would work.The idea behind the app was to track anybody that a person with coronavirus symptoms came into close contact with, using the Bluetooth connectivity on their smartphones.But the officials said that even using the Google–Apple model, Bluetooth was not good at accurately measuring the distance between two phones, making it unclear when somebody would fall in or out of the 2-metre physical distancing range.The UK had hoped to build an app that kept an anonymised central database of anybody an infected person had come into contact with. But Apple and Google refused to endorse that approach and said they would only redesign their operating systems for governments who used a decentralised approach, where no data was held in a single official database.British developers spent weeks trying to find a way of making their approach work, but it failed because once Apple phones had “gone to sleep” because they were inactive, they stopped communicating via Bluetooth.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had promised the app would be ready by mid-May and reports in the  that the government was considering switching that month were vehemently denied.

The three Chinese, one American and one Australian were not being detained but are required to report to officials regularly until they leave the country, immigration chief Ramesh Kumar KC said.The five were also fined for taking part in Saturday’s protests against the government’s handling of the coronavirus situation.All five will be banned from returning to Nepal for two years.Amnesty International has demanded that Egypt stop its “harassment and intimidation” of frontline medics for speaking out during the coronavirus pandemic.The rights group documented the cases of eight healthcare workers, including six doctors and two pharmacists, arbitrarily detained since March for online and social media posts expressing their concerns.It also interviewed seven doctors who said they witnessed security and administrative threats against their health worker colleagues for complaining on social media.“Amnesty International is calling on the Egyptian authorities to put an immediate end to their campaign of harassment and intimidation against healthcare workers who are speaking out,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa director.“The campaign not only further undermines freedom of expression in the country, but also hamstrings the efforts of those tackling the health crisis and puts their and others’ lives in danger,” he added.Frontline medics have been vocal in their requests to Egypt’s health ministry to provide healthcare workers with coronavirus tests, personal protective equipment and adequate access to health care if they contract the disease.“Healthcare workers in Egypt have been arrested, criminalised and prosecuted simply for daring to express their personal safety concerns and, in some cases, have been denied access to adequate health care,” Amnesty said.Earlier in the week, Egypt’s top doctors union urged authorities to immediately release its detained colleagues.The coronavirus crisis has claimed the lives of around 70 Egyptian doctors so far working in an overstretched healthcare system.Egypt has recorded nearly 50,000 Covid-19 cases nationwide including 1,850 deaths, according to official figures.Pope Francis’s impassioned appeal to protect nature is growing increasingly urgent as the global pandemic alters lifestyles and makes painfully plain the fragility of life, the Vatican has said.The worldwide Covid-19 outbreak struck as various Vatican departments were well into drafting a document calling on the faithful to carry out concrete local actions to mark the fifth anniversary of Francis encyclical that denounced the environment’s exploitation and strongly recommended caring for the Earth. The coronavirus crisis, the Vatican said in Thursday’s anniversary appeal, renders ever more evident, five years from its publication, the value of the pope’s encyclical. Hello everyone.

Here, three people who found their voices explain how you can do itIt should, these days, be easier than ever to make a point in public. If you want to tell your story there are places to blog and host videos, there is social media to help you find an audience, and free software and ever cheaper hardware to get you online.But in practice, not everyone finds it easy to push their ideas into a public space. So where do you begin, particularly if you feel as if you’re on the margins? As part of Levi’s Your Voice. Your Way campaign,  Labs talked to three young people who, driven by a burning desire to be heard, found their voices through blogging, podcasts and zines.This is their advice to others who are bubbling with ideas and opinions, who know they have something valuable to say, but may feel unchampioned or underestimated. These are the first steps to getting your voice heard ...1. Stay true to yourselfYou might admire a particular columnist or an influencer, but the world doesn’t need an exact copy of someone else. The world needs you.“I tried lots of voices on for size, but they weren’t really me,” says Jessica Riches, a social media and content specialist. She found her real voice and honed her social media skills during the student protests of 2010 when she became the clearest online voice of the group who occupied University College London in protest at increases in fees.“Politics was where I found myself,” she says. “I was able to learn and explore that side of myself and I found a community of people.”For Raifa Rafiq, a shared interest in books led her to create the Mostly Lit podcast with her friend Alex Reads. “The response we got was phenomenal,” she says of the podcast, which ran for four years, won awards and partnered with Waterstones. “We did something we enjoyed and ended up putting a different face on culture and arts criticism: you don’t have to be an old white man or a middle class white woman to love books or to talk about them.”2. Consider your platform carefullyWho do you want to reach and what are you trying to say? Both of these questions will have an effect on where and how you publish your work. “In terms of social media, this is key,” says Riches. “If you are telling a story that is text based, about news or opinion, then head to Twitter. If you want to draw people in with visuals, use Instagram. This sounds really obvious, but the mistake people often make at the beginning is over-committing. Pick the most appropriate platform and start there, that way you won’t end up disappointing yourself. You can always expand later.”Kirsty Fife has published her work on blogs and also created physical fanzines. “I started out blogging, I ran a fat-fashion blog, Fatty Unbound,” she says. “Blogging did create a space that wasn’t there at the time.” Digitally, she honed her writing and found a community, but decided to begin putting out fanzines when her work became more personal.3. Start creating“Think about what you engage with, what stops your thumb in its endless scroll,” says Riches. “Then think about what’s missing. Write down – privately – what you want your content principles to be. What topics are you going to cover, what are your boundaries? What will you enjoy creating? It sounds limiting, but it’s very freeing it stops you trying to talk about everything at once.”Creating a fanzine, says Fife: “Is still very lo-fi. It’s a Sharpie, sketchbooks, pieces of paper. Although these days I scan everything into my computer and create PDFs to print and distribute. I don’t want any more incidents with things getting stuck in work photocopiers.”The DIY approach has also worked for Rafiq, whose new podcast This Thing Changed My Life launched this month. “Buy equipment and teach yourself,” she says. “Some editing software is free and it might seem scary, but it’s not. YouTube taught me everything, and I started recording in a day. It’s saved me so much time and money.”4. Believe in yourselfThe biggest barriers, however, often aren’t the practical ones. Why, you might think, would anyone want to hear from you?“It’s hard to put something out into the world,” says Fife. “I used to think that anything I made had to be perfectly finished and polished. It will never be perfect, so push through those feelings of anxiety. Put whatever you can out there, don’t wait for validation to start.”“There will always be someone for whom your work is meaningful.”5. Build your communityFife, Rafiq and Riches all agree they have found communities through their creative work. “I found both friends and collaborators,” says Fife.But it’s worth remembering that an audience won’t appear overnight. “It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” says Riches. “And you need to put the work in. Start where you feel comfortable, ask your close friends to like what you’re doing, then expand to other friends. Build.”Riches also points out that finding a community and finding an audience are very closely linked. “Don’t forget that social media is supposed to be social,” she says. “Support other people in your field. Collaborate. Share. Showcase others and make connections.”Before starting to produce her own, Fife bought zines created by others. She recommends looking at zine distros – places that sell and distribute a number of different fanzines. “I go to Pen Fight Distro, Synchronise Witches Press and Vampire Hag. There will be a voice you enjoy out there.”Rafiq proved there was an audience for her work that had been ignored or discounted by much of the culture industry. “Young people do love the arts,” she says. “Arts criticism isn’t just an endeavour for Oxbridge grads. You can be from the inner city, you can be BAME and want this.”The effort is worth it, Fife says. “I’ve had a lot of people reach out to me over the years because they listened to my voice. I don’t have a professional background in writing, art or design, but I made things that meant something to others.”Use Your Voice ...At the heart of the Your Voice.

Photograph: iStockPubs intending to open from the end of the month can provide a time slot of an hour and three quarters for customers under final guidelines for the industry.Businesses will also be allowed to implement a one-metre physical distancing guideline in “permitted controlled environments.”Following pressure from industry representatives, the seating time in pubs has changed from 90 minutes to 105 minutes with an additional 15 minutes between bookings, which is two hours in total.“The 15 minutes has been added to allow for adequate cleaning and to ensure customers leave and enter without mixing,” the guidelines state.Businesses will now also be required to collect the contact information of just the “party lead”. Previously, the original HPSC guidance stated that this should be collected for the full group.The guidance says that where at all practical workers in pubs should provide services to only one gathering and should not move between different function rooms.It says toilets should not be used simultaneously by multiple gatherings. Pubs will also be asked to make regular announcements to remind customers to follow social distancing advice and wash their hands regularly and will be asked to place plexiglass barriers at tills and counters.Customers will also have to be seated at a table except when using the toilet, paying and departing.Pubs will be required to serve a “substantial meal” for which it would be reasonable to charge not less than €9. Physical distancing of at least one metre should be maintained between people seated at tables.Pre booking will be encouraged as much as possible and a text may be sent to remind the customer to stay away if unwell.A distance of two metres and a minimum of one metre should be maintained between employees. Where two metres is not possible “all other measures to protect employees should be in place,” the guidance says.Previously Dr Tony Holohan, the State’s chief medical officer, had said pubs operating as restaurants would not mean several people meeting up “for a few pints and having a packet of peanuts”.Pubs reopening as restaurants would not need a restaurant licence to do so, the Government has said.Fáilte Ireland chief executive Paul Kelly said the guidelines are “intended to provide clarity to businesses so that they can reopen safely on June 29th.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Man arrested at scene after 15 rounds shot from garda\u0026rsquos service weaponCatherine Martin\u0026rsquos speech was seen as pivotal in the internal debate within the partyAnne Graham says use of face coverings on public transport is up to Government to decideCastlerea priest tells of poignant scene when he performed last rites on detective in RoscommonThe physicist, who died in February, worked with Nasa to protect astronauts from radiationWidely-available drug shown in UK to significantly reduce death rateRural Independents TD plans to raise issue of infrastructure outside major citiesMore than 2,400 members have registered to vote on the programme for governmentEmails show nursing homes and families pleading for help from Leo VaradkarMembers believe it will take a lot of persuasion to get two-thirds to endorse documentFacilities in Galway and Mayo say they have had no deaths associated with the virusCuthbert Lucas played played tennis and croquet and drank whiskey with his captorsDr Ebun Joseph is encouraging young white Irish people to join an online discussion on racismCall for formal guidelines after Northern Irish data shows early intervention \u0026lsquocritical\u0026rsquoHSE chief to tell D\u0026aacuteil committee that half of nursing home infection clusters now \u0026lsquoclosed\u0026rsquoUnder Operation Coronation, 200 garda\u0026iacute and Army members swooped on three countiesJoint operation against Collopy gang yields evidence of criminal proceeds in UAESurvey shows children spending more time playing outdoors than before pandemicOnly contact details of one group member will be required under HPSC planThe children were due to be resettled in March, but it was postponed due to Covid-19Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4282481.1592486302!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"green s deputy leader strongly endorses programme for government at party conference","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Catherine Martin: “We must put the country first and never let it be said that we did not at times do all in our power to protect the planet.” Photograph: Gareth ChaneyGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin has strongly endorsed the programme for government at the party’s special conference, saying the agreement is “the best green deal in the history of the country”.In the opening address where she highlighted the achievements of the party in the document, she also pointed out its shortcomings and said no party member should look at it through “rose-tinted glasses”.She said she had decided to vote Yes because she believed that in government the “Greens would have the greatest potential to make real change.”Her speech was seen as pivotal in the internal debate within the party. Her strong support for going into government will be seen as an important boon for those who have backed the programme, given that she initially opposed going into coalition with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.Outlining the ‘wins’ in the document, she said she was particularly pleased about the reorientation of the transport budget a ban on gas exploration on fracked gas a referendum on housing measures tackling poverty and inequality in education exclusion zones around medical facilities and the ending of direct provision.“Throughout the document there are significant green traits to shape a greater future in terms of the environment.“I am satisfied that the deal negotiated was the best achievable and at its heart many worthwhile (Green principles),” she said.However, she continued: “As a card-carrying Green Party member there are some losses and we should not look at it through rose tinted glasses.“Many will be disappointed that more concessions on animal welfare, agriculture and housing were not achieved. Our concerns about the Development Agency remain substantial and real.”In in a gesture to those who are concerned about the programme, she said: “I understand if you cannot take this leap with me today but to the undecided amongst you I still hold out hope that you can give this a chance because you are needed now like never before.”Ms Martin referred several times to the seismic setback of the Covid-19 emergency, as well as the 130 days since the general election. She said the country needed a stable government.“It is a risk, a huge risk but one I am prepared to take, we must put the country first and never let it be said that we did not at times do all in our power to protect the planet,”she said.Ms Martin told the online conference, for which 2,300 people registered, that she was acutely conscious it was a time of deep political and economic uncertainty for the future of the planet, for people and for quality of life.She said there were never going to be outright winners nor could there be.“As you would expect the document is a compromise. It is a blend of what is important to us but also to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.“We pushed hard on climate justice, social justice and equality,” she said.Ms Martin said she was conscious of what happened to the Green Party in the 2007 but added it was incumbent on the party in government to ensure that all of the terms laid out were fulfilled and that the Greens worked hard to ensure that other items were included in the government agenda.OppositionEarlier it was reported that the three Green Party TDs who abstained on the vote on the programme for government will all oppose the party going into a coalition with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil during today’s special convention.However, in an early indication that the membership may be swaying in favour of the programme for government, some 68 per cent of the 237 members who applied for speaking time on Thursday will speak in favour of coalition deal, while 32 per cent will speak against.The agenda of the meeting, which was published this morning, shows that the three TDs who abstained Neasa Hourigan, Patrick Costello and Francis Noel Duffy, will speak against entering coalition during the online meeting.The conference began at 1pm with the five members of the negotiating team each talking through their respective areas.The debate proper will begin at 4pm. Among those speaking in favour of coalition will be TD, Joe Brien, MEP Grace O’Sullivan, and Senator Pauline O’Reilly.At the conclusion of the conference this evening, party leader Eamon Ryan will give the concluding speech in favour of the motion while Ms Hourigan will give the closing speech against the motion.Separately, a Fine Gael councillor who is a close political associate of Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has said he opposes the coalition agreement with Fianna Fáil and the Greens.Ray McAdam, a councillor in Mr Donohoe’s constituency of Dublin Central, said he cannot support such a coalition arrangement."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4282355.1592475289!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"is winning a seat on un security council a big deal for ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrom left Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Katherine Zappone, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and  Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney,   react as it was confirmed that Ireland had secured a seat on the  United Nations Security Council. Photograph: Julien Behal PhotographyIs winning a seat on the United Nations Security Council a big deal?The 15-member UN Security Council is the most powerful body in the UN system. In terms of global diplomacy, there is no higher platform where a country can influence international affairs.It is primarily responsible for maintaining international peace and security. The council determines when and where a UN peace operation is deployed.It has the power to make decisions that member states are obliged to adopt, though permanent members of the council, notably Russia, have used their veto powers to block resolutions made by the council, which has weakened it.So Ireland is getting to play international diplomacy with the big countries?Yes. There are five permanent members of the council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Ten non-permanent members are elected by the UN General Assembly for two-year terms.Ireland and Norway won the two seats in their regional group on Wednesday, edging out Canada in a three-horse race.Ireland will hold the monthly presidency of the council at least once during its term in office as it is rotated alphabetically among the membership, so this will be a high profile role for Ireland’s ambassador at the UN, Geraldine Byrne Nason, and whoever the new Minister for Foreign Affairs is in the next government.What swung it for the Irish bid?It is hard to say because the vote is a secret ballot. The Irish campaign, hung on a theme of “Empathy, Partnership and Independent”, played up Ireland’s status as a small nation being able to sit at the table with the big nations and represent the small countries at the 193-nation forum. Ireland’s history of famine, emigration and conflict resolution along with the Irish commitment to multilateralism and long contribution to UN peacekeeping (since 1958) will no doubt have helped. Hard to say. The U2 singer’s appeal as a humanitarian certainly did not hurt Ireland’s bid if the crowd of UN ambassadors that swarmed around him and former Irish president Mary Robinson when they helped launch Ireland’s bid in New York in the summer of 2018 is to be judged.Has Ireland held a temporary seat on the council before?Yes, on three previous occasions - in 1962, 1981 and 2001. Did it make a difference then?Yes. Ireland’s then ambassador to the UN Richard Ryan held the month-long presidency of the UN Security Council in October 2001 when the US started bombing targets in Afghanistan in response to the September 11th terror attacks. Mr Ryan had to work diplomatic channels to bring the US into the Security Council and encourage the neo-conservative foreign policy hawks in the George W Bush administration to use the inner sanctum of the UN which it had avoided because of potential entanglement with permanent members China and Russia over its military actions. How much has membership of the council cost and will it cost?The Government spent €840,000 on the campaign to win a seat over a three-year period - about half what the Norwegians and Canadians spent on their campaigns. A further €2 million has been budgeted by the Government for the two years Ireland is on the council from the start of 2021.Is it worth it?Critics have dismissed the value of membership with former  diplomatic correspondent Wesley Boyd describing it as an “expensive vanity trip.” This has been rejected by Government officials, diplomats and others who see the role on the council as bringing respect and influence to a small country on one of the highest international stages. As one of only three European Union members on the council, it will also help Ireland’s standing at a European level.Could our membership cause tensions with other countries?Quite possibly. Ireland will be joining the council at a critical time as multilateral institutions like the UN are under threat from the rise of nationalism and the increasing power of dictators and authoritarian countries. The council will over the coming years face difficult decisions on escalating international tensions between large powers, climate change and humanitarian crises as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will affect some of the poorest countries on the planet."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Kim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrate her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionSocial media giant says China ran network of accounts to spread misinformationTwo years after Trump-Kim summit minister says peace hopes are now \u0026lsquodark nightmare\u0026rsquoThere had been repeated calls by the Maori community to remove statue of John HamiltonLam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayHospitals feel the strain as lockdowns are eased despite fears of a spike in infectionsHolidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogMan (60) dies some 500 miles north of Sydney after board-riders pull him to shoreLarge crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4282393.1592477259!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kim jong un s sister takes a wrecking ball to south korea relationship","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKim Yo-jong: In North Korea, future top leaders must build credentials as someone who can stand up against South Korea and the United States.  Photograph: Jorge SilvaPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesWhen North Korea decided to join the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea and kick off a giddy period of rapprochement on the peninsula, its charm offensive was fronted by a smiling face: Kim Yo-jong, the only sister of the North’s top leader, Kim Jong-un.Now, as Kim threatens to extinguish the fragile détente with a new cycle of bellicose actions and military provocations, it’s his sister who is again speaking for the nation, this time heaping scorn on South Korea – a signal of her deepening clout in the hereditary regime.“It was sickening to listen to his speech,” Kim Yo-jong said of the South’s leader, Moon Jae-in, in a statement on Wednesday, referring to his message this week calling for peace on the Korean Peninsula. “He seems to be insane, though he appears to be normal outwardly.”“So I decided to prepare a bomb of words to let it be known to our people,” she said.In North Korea, few leaders other than Kim Jong-un can issue first-person statements like that. But Kim Yo-jong (32), who is her brother’s top spokeswoman and policy co-ordinator, wields far more power than is suggested by her age and meagre titles: first deputy departmental chief in the ruling Workers’ Party and an alternate – not a regular – member of its Politburo.‘Revolutionary blood’Her influence in a hierarchy studded with ageing generals and party secretaries derives from the “revolutionary blood” coursing through her body. She is a granddaughter of Kim Il -sung, North Korea’s founder, who is still revered as a godlike figure in the North.That makes her a potential candidate – even in the North’s deeply patriarchal culture – to replace her brother, who is believed to be 36, should he die or become incapacitated.Kim Yo-jong’s systematic rise adds a sense of continuity to North Korea’s succession plans, analysts said. In North Korea, future top leaders must build credentials as someone who can stand up against South Korea and the United States.“What we see right now is North Korea working out a contingency succession plan in case Kim Jong-un’s health goes bad,” said Yoo Dong-ryul, a North Korea specialist at the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul.“The problem with Kim Yo-jong as successor is that she is a woman and is still too young,” he added. “So her brother is helping her lead the offence against South Korea and establish her leadership so she can dissipate any reservations the hard-line stalwarts in the military and party might have about her.”Kim Jong-un’s long absences from public view in recent months have spurred speculation about whether he was seriously ill, what might happen to the North’s nuclear arsenal and who would succeed him if he became incapacitated. If he had to give up power, none of his three children – all believed to be preteens – are old enough to take over.Kim has an older brother, Kim Jong-chol, who is said to have been considered by their father to be too effeminate to lead the highly militarised country. He has never been seen in public with his younger brother.In 2017, Kim had his half-brother, Jong Nam, assassinated in Kuala Lumpur. He also executed his uncle Jang Song Thaek. Kim has another uncle, Kim Pyong Il (65), who was recalled home last year after decades of serving as a low-key ambassador to Eastern European countries. But after being away for so long, he has no power base in Pyongyang.Kim’s aunt, Kim Kyong Hui, Jang’s wife, is ailing. All this leaves Kim Yo-jong the most likely hereditary successor if her brother dies before his children grow up, analysts said.Swiss schoolsShe and Kim Jong-un attended schools in Switzerland as teenagers. But the outside world had seen little of her until she appeared beside him during the funeral of their father, Kim Jong-Il, in 2011.Some experts in South Korea say she is married to Choe Song, who is said to work at Office 39, a secretive agency that manages funds for the Kim family. Choe is a son of Choe Ryong Hae, who holds the most senior party titles after Kim.Kim Yo-jong grabbed global attention when she became the first member of the Kim family to cross the border into South Korea, attending the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, in 2018. Later, she was at her brother’s side at his summits with Moon, President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping of China.She stood next to Kim Jong-un when he signed a joint statement with Trump after their historic first summit on denuclearising the Korean Peninsula, held in Singapore in June 2018. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo was her US counterpart during the ceremony.Kim Yo-jong apparently lost her Politburo job as Kim replaced his foreign policy team after the collapse of his second summit with Trump, which was held in Vietnam in February 2019. But this year, with Kim shifting to an increasingly hostile relationship with Seoul and Washington as his diplomatic efforts with Trump stall, Kim Yo-jong’s stock began rising again.Since March, she has been issuing statements under her own name, lashing Moon’s office for its “imbecile way of thinking”. She praised a letter that Trump sent to her brother in March, calling it a “good judgment” but not enough to improve ties.Liaison officeSince last week, North Korea’s state news media has depicted her as the orchestrator of a rapid-fire series of statements and moves that have raised tensions on the Korean Peninsula. On Tuesday, the North blew up the inter-Korean liaison office in the border city of Kaesong, and a day later, the North Korean military threatened to resume drills along the disputed western sea border with the South.Kim Yo-jong’s offensive claimed a first political casualty in South Korea on Wednesday. The unification minister, Kim Yeon-chul, stepped down, taking responsibility for the deterioration in relations with the North, which has followed the South’s failed efforts to mediate between North Korea and the United States.The North’s sudden turn toward animosity with the South – and, by extension, the United States – may reflect a desire to unify the country in the face of an economy further hobbled by the coronavirus pandemic and of a deepening need to push for concessions on international sanctions, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.Placing Kim Yo-jong up front in North Korea’s growing confrontation with Seoul and Washington may also give Kim “diplomatic flexibility” if he wants to change course, Easley said.Whatever the motivation behind the growing tension, it has made one thing clear: Kim Yo-jong’s consolidation of her position as the true No 2 in her brother’s government, said Lee Seong-hyon, an analyst at the Sejong Institute, a research centre in South Korea.“As she leads the offence against South Korea like a general, it silences those old hard-liners in the Politburo who may think she cannot be the leader,” Lee said. – New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279823.1592246043!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu prepares to knuckle down for summer of brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Boris Johnson participates in a video-conference call on Monday with European Council president Charles Michel, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Parliament president David Sassoli and the EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. Photograph: Andrew Parsons10 Downing StreetAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union is preparing to redouble efforts and work through the summer to hammer out a deal with Britain following a meeting between prime minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders on Monday.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel and David Sassoli, president of the European Parliament, held a video conference with the British leader to take stock of the lack of progress in the talks, with just six months remaining before barriers to trade between Britain and its neighbours make an abrupt return, after decades spent removing them.The political leadership on both sides sent the message to their negotiators to go back over the areas where they had encountered stumbling blocks and try again to see if they can inch their way to a compromise that would avoid the most drastic ‘no trade deal’ option.“We agreed . . . that new momentum was required,” Ms von der Leyen said following the meeting.The mood in Brussels was upbeat towards the prospects of reaching a deal following the meeting, with those working close to the negotiations expecting a summer of late-night marathon talks that would likely run through the traditional holiday period.\u0026nbspBritain had initially briefed that it would abandon attempts to find a deal at this stage if it felt insufficient progress had been made, and focus its work instead on preparing for an automatic switch from January 1st to World Trade Organisation terms – a global default system of tariffs expected to cause a significant blow to trade.London’s shift away from this position and commitment to the talks has been taken as an indication that a deal can be found.Joint statementIn a joint statement following the meeting, both sides committed to “create the most conducive conditions for concluding and ratifying a deal before the end of 2020”.“The parties underlined their intention to work hard to deliver a relationship which would work in the interests of the citizens of the union and of the United Kingdom, ” the joint statement read. “They also confirmed their commitment to the full and timely implementation of the withdrawal agreement.”The two sides have agreed to six rounds of negotiations between June 29th and August 21st, held physically if possible and alternating between London and Brussels. Since February, negotiations have been over video conference because of the pandemic, ruling out informal side chats that often help find common ground.Sticking points include fishing rights and fair competition provisions for business.On policing and security co-operation, a way through could be possible, as the EU is open to workarounds through the international policing co-operation body Interpol. However, this would be a far more distant kind of co-operation than once hoped for.The British side has bridled at insistence by the EU that the deal should contain a commitment to uphold the Paris Climate Accord, insisting that this goes far beyond the stipulations of past trade deals. But in the EU’s view, modern-day trade deals have evolved to include such commitments, and they are appropriate because Britain is a like-minded country that has signed up to the agreement anyway.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Stephane LemoutonAFPIreland has won a seat on the UN Security Council, in a major boost for the country’s foreign policy credentials.Ireland secured 128 votes – exactly the two-thirds majority needed to qualify – in a vote at UN headquarters in New York on Wednesday.Norway was also elected in the first round, securing 130 votes. In a blow to Canadian leader Justin Trudeau, Canada failed to win a seat – the second time it has lost a bid over the last decade.Ireland’s two-year term on the 15-member council will begin in January and will mark the fourth time the country has held a seat on the influential international body.Ireland’s ambassador to the United Nations, Geraldine Byrne Nason, had been leading efforts to secure a seat on the council in New York, while Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney liaised with countries across the globe in an effort to drum up support for Ireland’s bid.At a press conference in Government Buildings, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste both said Ireland had “punched above its weight”.Tough electionMr Varadkar said it had been a “tough election” and the contest against Canada and Norway made it the “group of death”.“We are a small country that has a big presence and is a force of good,” he said. He said the fact that Ireland was the only member of the EU vying for the position was a factor, as was our relationship with African and island states and the work done by the Irish Defence Forces in the UN.“For a small country, we have a lot of influence,” said Mr Coveney, adding that the result showed a lot of countries respected the good standing that Ireland has had.Both said the €800,000 spent on the campaign was justified, and noted it was half that spent by Norway and Canada.“It was money well spent to ensure that Irish values and Irish foreign policy is shaping global decision-making for the next two years,” said Mr Coveney.While Norway had been expected to be elected in the first round, Ireland’s qualification in the first round of voting was particularly noteworthy. Voting had been expected to stretch into a second round on Thursday.Ireland’s track record on foreign development aid, its history as a colonised country and affinity with other small nations, as well as its commitment to UN peacekeeping, are likely to have persuaded its fellow UN members to support the bid.Peace processIn addition, Ireland was the only country in its group that is a member of the European Union. Its stance on the Middle East peace process and support for the two-state solution is also likely to have sat well with Arab nations.President Michael D Higgins, who hosted several events during the UN General Assembly in New York last September to highlight Ireland’s international credentials and track record on climate change and poverty reduction, congratulated those involved in the bid, noting that the campaign “engaged with global issues, such as peace-building and peacekeeping, the elimination of global poverty, the strengthening of multilateralism, and reform of the United Nations.”Former US ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, who was born in Ireland, was among those who congratulated Ireland on its campaign.Goal’s chief executive, Siobhan Walsh, said the result “both speaks to our ambition as a nation to meaningfully contribute to the global community, while representing an acknowledgement by other nations of Ireland’s unique offering to the world”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

Has Sir Keir Starmer suddenly become Prime Minister? What’s happened to the ebullient, optimistic, can-do Boris? These were the questions that even the Prime Minister’s greatest fans had started to ask after the drift, chaos and lack of direction of the past few weeks.With Boris Johnson almost invisible, the Government felt rudderless, bogged down in detail, strangely unable to lead us out of lockdown, excessively risk-averse and in hock to discredited “experts”. It gave the impression of being blase about the calamitous economic, educational and welfarist cultural consequences of the never-ending lockdown and insufficiently self-confident to be able to admit publicly that the state apparatus had failed.Then came the hijacking of the anti-racist protests, the traducing of a heartfelt movement decrying the despicable murder of George Floyd in America, the lawlessness, the hard-Left and hard-Right protests, the smack of cultural revolution, the orgy of officially-sanctioned wokeness.Where was Boris? Wasn’t this meant to be a conservative, patriotic and competent government? Why was Churchill’s statue boarded up, and the mob allowed to tear down or deface with impunity in what purports to be a law-governed democracy? Where was the modern, anti-racist, pro-meritocracy, conservative side of the argument, the alternative narrative that Boris ought to have been so great at delivering?Priti Patel and others did a great job putting that argument, but it felt piecemeal. The void from the centre was mystifying. It was as if the virus had blown the Government up, that it was still suffering from shell-shock, its confidence shot to pieces by the death toll, its ability to readjust to a new political landscape severely impaired.Some of this was unfair: No 10 has been forced to micromanage much of the fight against Covid as a result of the failure of our nationalised health establishment. Massive improvements have been quietly pushed through. Johnson was exhausted: the coronavirus is exceptionally draining and damaging, and its victims take ages to recover fully. But political warfare isn’t fair, and the Government made unforced errors, not least in imposing a quarantine even on countries that have defeated the virus. Its inability to reopen schools has proved especially debilitating, as has its obsession with a two-metre rule that isn’t followed in nations that have reopened without a second wave.Yes, the Government is right to be worried: Covid is a terrible threat, and the number of cases is shooting up again in the US and elsewhere. But the only way forward is to reopen regardless, as France, Spain and Italy have done, to shift the narrative towards one of co-existence with a contained virus, to hope that new drugs and vaccines are arriving soon, to tell the public that they can go back to work, to put in place genuinely mass testing and tracing systems. We cannot lock down forever and we cannot afford to lock down again.The drift of the past two months has allowed the Left-wing establishment to reassert itself. The BBC has appointed one of its own as its new boss an ex-Treasury, ex-IMF, Left-wing think tanker was appointed as head of the Office for Budget Responsibility the CBI’s new boss used to advise Gordon Brown and work for the . The only economic policy we heard about – apart from the necessary spending of hundreds of billions to cushion the economy – were “green jobs”, state-infrastructure, government this and government that. The Left-liberal elites were beginning to hope again that Boris’ project was about to fail. The EU detected weakness, crashing the talks before seeking to prolong the transition.Yet with luck all of this is now history. The Government has finally launched its comeback, to the great relief of its base. It is holding firm on Brexit and reinjecting energy into the talks. Johnson sounds like himself his mojo is returning. The first real signs of this fightback came on Sunday, with the revelation of a crackdown against those defacing war monuments. We were also reminded that May’s gender-identifying reform plans would be ditched.Then Johnson wrote one of his classic, barnstorming articles for this newspaper. The new equalities commission, set up by the brilliant Munira Mirza, suggests an innovative, authentically liberal-conservative and anti-Marxist approach to tackling entrenched inequalities, racism and poverty. Kemi Badenoch, another Tory star who deserves to be promoted to the cabinet at the next reshuffle, will be leading the group. The significance of this endeavour and the excellence of the personnel selected for it cannot be underplayed.Next came the abolition of the Department for International Development, and its absorption into the Foreign Office. Australia and others have long since pushed through such a sensible reform, which will reduce waste, junkets and ineffective, counterproductive spending, and allow a unified foreign policy. It’s a great step in the right direction: the useless aid-industrial complex hates it.There have still been some missteps such as the fiasco over free school meals. It was never a battle worth fighting and should have been nipped in the bud. But the trend is hugely positive: Johnson was on his old form at PMQs, trouncing Starmer over the latter’s refusal to accept that it’s safe for children to return to school. His language is Johnsonian again: “A great ox has stood on your tongue”, he said of Starmer the aid reforms end “the great cashpoint in the sky”.Which takes us to the virus: Boris’s relaunch must extend to shaking-up the Government’s frightened approach. He needs to tell his Johnsonian stories again. Scientists can no longer be used as human shields. All schools will open fully in September, with no social distancing. He must ditch the two-metre rule immediately. Above all, he must display leadership, passion and optimism, dragging Britain back to quasi-normality.His language has shifted the signs are promising. But a PM elected with such support and promise can no longer allow his Government to falter. The next 12 months will determine his fate and legacy: the old Boris has returned, and the country cannot allow him to disappear again.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden surprisingly slow achieving herd immunity study finds","story":"Sweden’s state epidemiologist has said the country has been “surprisingly slow” at achieving herd immunity.The death toll in Sweden passed 5,000 on Wednesday and the Scandinavian nation has one of the highest mortality rates in the world at 487 per 1m population, approximately ten times higher than neighbouring Norway.Yet an analysis by Werlabs AB of 50,000 tests showed that only 14 per cent of those living in the Stockholm region tested positive for coronavirus antibodies. In Bergamo, considered to be the epicentre of Italy’s deadly outbreak, about 57 per cent of people had antibodies. The UK’s Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance estimated that 60 per cent of people would need to be infected to achieve herd immunity from the novel coronavirus.Sweden chose not to implement a strict lockdown, running contrary to many other countries worldwide. Schools, shops and restaurants have all remained open during the course of 2020. Instead, the government deferred to scientific advice and recommended Swedes observe social distancing. There had been expectations that this policy choice would have allowed Sweden to achieve herd immunity without imposing an economically and socially crippling lockdown.However, in an interview with Swedish Radio, Anders Tegnell, Sweden\u0027s chief epidemiologist, admitted that immunity rates were low and that “it’s difficult to explain why this is so.”Mr Tegnell and Prime Minister Stefan Lofven have long defended their softer approach to lockdown, stating the disease is not something that can be defeated with a short term fix but that nation’s must learn to live with the virus.A minute’s silence was observed in the country’s parliament to honour the 5,000 people who lost their lives.Andres Norlen, the parliamentary speaker, said “parliament is mourning.

However, corrections to the figures suggest it was 72 per cent, since when it has risen slightly to 73.4 per cent. The figures also show the number of cases referred to the service has fallen as infections continue to drop across the country.In the first week the service was in operation, 51,851 people were identified as close contacts.This fell to 44,895 people in the second week of service. Of those, 40,690 were reached and advised to self-isolate, meaning nearly one in ten were missed or refused to comply.The programme was supposed to be backed by an app. But on Wednesday, Lord Bethell, the minister responsible for the Government\u0027s smartphone app, said that was not a priority.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, had previously suggested it would be rolled out a month ago.Lord Bethell told MPs: “We are seeking to get something going for the winter, but it isn’t the priority at the moment.” He told the science and technology Committee that a pilot of the app on the Isle of Wight had been successful, but also showed that people prefer human contact to technological approaches.He said that the Government was not feeling great time pressure over the app, and did not want to poison the pool by rushing something out that was not quite right.Health officials have stressed the need for a successful test, track and isolate programme amid concerns of a possible second wave of coronavirus cases in the autumn.On Thursday Dr Hans Kluge, European regional director of the World Health Organisation, said contact tracing was an essential element of the strategy to respond to the threat of a second wave of the pandemic. Dr Kluge said: It\u0027s well possible that when the autumn starts and we have also the seasonal influenza, there is the possibility of a seasonal effect on the virus - but we\u0027re not sure yet - that then we will see a second wave.So the lesson is that we have to implement what we know works - at the core of the strategy is to find as early as possible, isolate, test suspected people from Covid, and if needs be treat them without any stigma or discrimination.At the same time (governments need) to track and quarantine contacts - contact tracing is an essential element of this strategy. But there is no single solution.Dido Harding, executive chairman of NHS Test and Trace,said: “NHS Test and Trace is working to stop the spread of coronavirus and undoubtedly helping to save lives.

One factory owner\u0026nbsptells\u0026nbspBen Chapman that\u0026nbsphe will have to close\u0026nbspunless he receives payment from Sir Philip Green\u0027s\u0026nbspArcadia Group soon, leaving thousands of workers\u0026nbsp- mostly young women -\u0026nbspout of workA Bangladeshi factory owner has warned he will go out of business within days, leaving 2,000 workers facing destitution unless Sir Philip Green\u0027s Arcadia group honours contracts for thousands of items of clothing.Mostafiz Uddin, who owns Denim Expert Limited in Chittagong, says his company is on the brink of collapse after months of asking for more than $2m of payments for goods that were ordered before the coronavirus pandemic.Thousands of boxes of garments remain stacked up in Denim Expert\u0027s factory even as Topshop stores reopened to large crowds on Monday after lockdown conditions were eased. Mr Uddin is one of a number of suppliers who say that Sir Philip\u0027s fashion empire has refused to pay for millions of pounds worth of orders, leaving them struggling to pay workers and keep the lights on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Uddin told The Independent that he was forced to shut down production two weeks ago because cancelled orders meant his cash flow had dried up and he could not pay money owed to suppliers of materials. He said he is now paying out $25,000 (£20,400) per day in costs but has no income, and now fears that without an urgent resolution he will have to close his doors for good.The Bangladesh Export Processing Zone, where Denim Expert\u0027s factory is located, has suspended Mr Uddin’s import and export permissions because of unpaid rent and utility bills. Goods that were due to be shipped out in February and March have been sat in containers at the port incurring charges each day.“With payments virtually suspended since the outbreak started, there has been a catastrophic impact upon the cash flow of our operation, which functions on very low margins at the best of times,” Mr Uddin said. Millions of garment workers facing destitution as demand dries upHe now has potential orders from other companies pending but does not have the cash available to fulfil them because of money tied up in goods produced, or currently in production, for Arcadia.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAccording to campaign group Traidcraft, around 70 per cent of the cost of the garments is for the raw materials that go into them. Most manufacturers take this material on credit and pay it off when buyers pay them for the finished goods, meaning that when money is not forthcoming they quickly run into problems. Arcadia said it had no direct relationship with Denim Expert but confirmed that it did have outstanding orders for the company\u0027s goods via a third party which buys jeans from a number of factories.Following media coverage of Mr Uddin\u0027s problems with Arcadia and other buyers, an Arcadia representative contacted Denim Expert but no agreement has been reached. The company offered to buy some of the goods but not until August, an offer which Mr Uddin said he could not accept. An Arcadia spokesperson said the group was “in ongoing discussions” with its suppliers, including Denim Expert, to come to an agreement about the cancelled orders. The group has been in financial difficulty in recent years, narrowly avoiding administration in June 2019 after landlords backed a rescue deal at the last minute. Under the deal, 50 stores were earmarked for closure and 1,000 people lost their jobs. Former Debenhams employees raise money for Bangladeshi workersWhy coronavirus could add fuel to fast fashion’s fireRenting could be the trick to help me curb my fast fashion habitsLike the rest of the fashion retail sector, Arcadia has also been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown, which forced all non-essential stores to close on the 23 March until some reopened this week.Mr Uddin is one of hundreds of suppliers to the fashion industry facing imminent closure after months of unpaid orders.While some buyers, including H\u0026ampM and Zara, have honoured the majority of contracts and paid for orders, others such as Asda, Arcadia and Edinburgh Woollen Mill have demanded steep discounts or failed to paid for goods altogether.According to data published in April by the Bangladesh Garments and Manufacturing Association (BGMEA), the Arcadia Group cancelled £9m of orders in Bangladesh alone.Usually in manufacturing industries like this, whatever the buyer wants, you have to accept. That’s how it\u0027s been for the last 100 years.Globally, the group, which is owned by Sir Philip\u0027s wife through a holding company in Monaco, cancelled as much as £100m, according to The Worker Rights Consortium (WRC).Mr Uddin added: “I am not interested to work with Arcadia any more. I want to get rid of them as a buyer. Usually in manufacturing industries like this, whatever the buyer wants, you have to accept. That’s how’s its been for the last 100 years.“I have made up my mind. I only want to work with the people who are fair and responsible.”Fiona Gooch, senior policy advisor at Traidcraft Exchange, said: “It is terrible that factories are having to close in Bangladesh, and other garment producing countries, through no fault of their own. By refusing to pay up, brands like Philip Green’s Burton Menswear are putting thousands of workers, mainly young women and their families at risk of destitution. Philip Green is a millionaire. Like other fashion brand owners, he can easily afford to pay for the finished clothes that they have previously ordered, and the fabric bought to make future orders for them.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the bank’s purchasing programme provides some useful insurance against itAs the saying goes: “A billion here, a billion there – soon you’re talking serious money.”How about hundreds of billions?The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee has voted to increase its asset purchase scheme by another £100bn. This comes on top of the £200bn it committed to purchasing earlier in the year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat does that mean?The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?The first thing to note is that the bank will now be purchasing £300bn of UK government bonds in 2020.That’s roughly equivalent to the projected deficit of the UK government in the current financial year to pay for all its emergency coronavirus-related spending, including the jobs furlough scheme.It’s not quite correct to say that the bank is funding the state’s spiralling deficit during this crisis.The projected public-sector net cash requirement is actually more than £400bn and private investors will have to buy the debt first and then sell to the bank.Yet it’s abundantly clear to everyone in the financial markets that the bank is acting as an effective backstop for government’s borrowing.Does that matter?It certainly matters for UK government bond investors.They know they can be confident that when they buy UK government bonds – known as gilts – from the Debt Management Office they will be able to sell them on to the bank.That removes any fear that they will be stuck holding bonds that no one else wants to buy.This should stabilise the market for UK government debt, meaning that it can continue to borrow to support millions of ordinary British workers and businesses.It’s far from clear that there was any danger of a crisis in the UK government bond market. But the bank’s purchasing programme provides some useful insurance against it.Will it help the economy directly? The bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy. The evidence here is somewhat mixed. It’s plausible that purchases helped do that in the immediate wake of the financial crisis. But the power of successive rounds of asset purchases to support demand directly seemed to weaken.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In part that’s because previous warnings of an inflationary spiral proved unwarranted.It’s also because the Bank is no outlier it’s doing pretty much the same as other big central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The Fed has effectively promised unlimited bond purchases in this crisis.£100bn is serious money in anyone’s book. But the reality is that, in the world of central banking in the era of Covid-19, it’s nothing particularly special.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Only one in ten businesses say they could not operate at all if staff had to stay two metres apart or continued to work from home.However, only 28 per cent said their business could run as effectively as it would without the rule. A further 38 per cent believe their company could operate “largely effectively” and another 24 per cent “somewhat effectively”.While the government is increasingly coming under fire for the way it has handled the outbreak, more business leaders back its response that criticise it.Half (48 per cent) said the government’s response to coronavirus when it comes to business has been good, compared to 38 per cent who said it has been bad, and 13 per cent who said neither.Respondents were largely pessimistic about the economic outlook. Eight in ten business people expect that in 12 months’ time the economy will be in worse shape than it was before the coronavirus outbreak.They were more optimistic about their own businesses’ prospects for the year ahead.

Germany’s Dax index was down 0.4 per cent, France’s dropped 0.6 per cent.£100bn stimulus package injected into UK economy – follow liveThe Bank warned last month that the UK economy would contract by as much as 30 per cent in the first half of the year - its worst performance since the early 1700s.It said in its report on Thursday that recent data indicates the recession will not be as severe as previously thought but warned of “higher and more persistent” unemployment.The Bank struck a more pessimistic tone on the outlook for jobs which it said was now “tilted to the downside”. Official figures showed employers had 612,000 fewer people on their payrolls in May than in March as companies froze hiring and laid off staff. On the economy more generally, the MPC warned: “While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic.”Voting against further stimulus measures ,Mr Haldane said that the recovery was happening “sooner and materially faster” than had been forecast in May.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Public sector borrowing is expected to surpass £400bn this year.The Bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy which has fallen dramatically during the pandemic.There had been some speculation that the Bank might cut its key benchmark interest rate to below zero for the first time.Governor Andrew Bailey said last month that the Bank was considering all options to help the economy through what will be a deep recession.Some experts have called on the Bank of England to go further by directly financing government spending.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

YouGov’s survey also found that a minority of companies face difficulties dealing with social distancing rules. Only one in ten businesses say they could not operate at all if staff had to stay two metres apart or continued to work from home.However, only 28 per cent said their business could run as effectively as it would without the rule. A further 38 per cent believe their company could operate “largely effectively” and another 24 per cent “somewhat effectively”.While the government is increasingly coming under fire for the way it has handled the outbreak, more business leaders back its response that criticise it.Half (48 per cent) said the government’s response to coronavirus when it comes to business has been good, compared to 38 per cent who said it has been bad, and 13 per cent who said neither.Respondents were largely pessimistic about the economic outlook. Eight in ten business people expect that in 12 months’ time the economy will be in worse shape than it was before the coronavirus outbreak.They were more optimistic about their own businesses’ prospects for the year ahead. Six in ten think that in a year their company will be in either be in an identical condition or better than it was before the virus struck.

He joined Google as CEO in 2001, when the company had back several hundred employees, and became its executive chairman in 2011 when co-founder Larry Page became CEO. Schmidt stepped down from his chairman role in 2017.“There\u0027s no question that information from Huawei routers has ultimately ended up in hands that would appear to be the state,” Mr Schmidt added in a BBC Radio 4 documentary.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSchmidt continued to say that Huawei represents a challenge to the United States because of the quality of products it is manufacturing.“It\u0027s extremely important that we have choices,” he said. “The answer to Huawei... is to compete by having a product and product line that is as good.”China \u0027trying to use Huawei to drive a wedge\u0027 between US and UKIn response, Huawei denied these allegations. “It is simply not true,” Victor Zhang, Huawei\u0027s UK chief told the BBC.The US government has yet to reveal evidence that Huawei is compromising its technology at the behest of the Chinese state.In some cases, it has argued that lack of evidence points to China’s motives, with US officials comparing it to a Trojan Horse that must be inside the gates before revealing its true intentions.Schmidt also said that he underestimated China’s potential as innovators, but denied that state-directed investment is inherently better than the free market.“That they\u0027re very good at copying things, that they\u0027re very good at organising things, that they throw large numbers of people at it. But they\u0027re not going to do anything new. They\u0027re very, very good at stealing, if you will, our stuff.

They are putting it in a different way, it is state-directed in a way that is different from the West. We need to get our act together to compete.”Instead, Western companies need to invest more into research funding, have greater collaboration between the private sector, the state, and academia, and open its doors to talent from around the world, he said.Mr Schmidt also warned against the rise of nationalism and protectionism around the world. “Once you erge these global platforms, you don\u0027t get them back,” he said.The comment comes after Donald Trump renewed an executive order against Huawei and other Chinese companies, stopping US firms including Google from working with them.“We benefit from having a common platform of interchange... and I worry that by building these platforms separate, the countries will understand each other less, Mr Schmidt said.”China\u0027s going to dominate whether we couple or decouple. They have the resources, they have the money, they have the technology. The question is do they operate on global platforms or do they operate on their own platforms? The more segregated the platforms are, the more dangerous it is.”“It is in the West\u0027s interest that every technology platform has Western values in them.”Schmidt previously advocated for Google to work with the Chinese government to create a censored search engine. “In 2010, I was in favour of remaining in China because I believed they would be better to stay in China and help change China to be more open,” he told the BBC.Google since ended its work in China, codenamed Project Dragonfly, last year.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Public sector borrowing is expected to surpass £400bn this year.The Bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy which has fallen dramatically during the pandemic.There had been some speculation that the Bank might cut its key benchmark interest rate to below zero for the first time.Governor Andrew Bailey said last month that the Bank was considering all options to help the economy through what will be a deep recession.Some experts have called on the Bank of England to go further by directly financing government spending.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So starting today, we’re testing a new feature that will add a more human touch to the way we use Twitter — your very own voice,” Twitter designer Maya Patterson and engineer Rémy Bourgoin wrote in a blog post.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt is possible to record for longer, however. “Have more to say? Keep talking. Once you reach the time limit for a tweet, a new voice tweet starts automatically to create a thread,” Twitter said.Messages longer than that will be automatically threaded, up to 25 tweets. This gives people a total of 3,500 seconds, or just under an hour, of voice content to upload, according to a Twitter help page.For now, voice tweets are only functional for stand-alone posts there is no way to quote-tweet with a voice note, or reply with one yet.Your voice note will be accompanied with your profile picture on the timeline, but that will not update if you change your image.On iOS, when users tap play, a dock will be created at the bottom of the app so people can continue listening as they scroll through Twitter, as well as when they leave the app.It is currently unclear how such tweets will be moderated by Twitter, at a time when the company is under pressure by the US government for its actions regarding Donald Trump’s account.Twitter adds fact-checking label to tweets linking pandemic with 5GMr Trump recently signed an executive order which limits protections given to all companies for user content on their platform – whether that’s a multinational corporation or a small blog – in a move that could have wide ramifications for the internet.This is not the only experiment Twitter is running on its platform.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose. I do all kinds of areas of work but one of them is to make crowds of people.Created with Sketch.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease. So put simply, if I wear one I protect you, if you wear one you protect me.Patrick Grant is a star of television’s ‘Great British Sewing Bee’The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Every library, museum and gallery could be closed in one of England’s biggest cities as local authorities across the country struggle to balance the books in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.Leeds City Council has also said it may have to slash more than 400 jobs as the sheer extent of the cost of Covid-19 on regional government starts to emerge.In a brutally candid virtual press conference, Tom Riordan, the West Yorkshire council’s chief executive, admitted the situation was “as severe as it gets”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe told reporters: “If we anticipate that we can’t balance our budget, we have to take steps to pare our spending right back to the things we just have a legal duty to provide. That would rule out many of the services we provide today, for example the cultural institutions that we fund in the city are non-statutory.“We would have to take very Draconian measures.”For context, it was shown that the council’s overspend this year stands at £197.6m. It’s total budget is £530m.While councils have a legal duty to provide library services, it is widely thought this could be pared back to a skeleton, online-lending resource without breaking that obligation.The revelation of such possible cuts is the starkest warning yet of the economic devastation being faced by authorities across the UK as a result of the ongoing pandemic.Officials have found themselves having to ramp up spending on hugely expanded social care provisions – such as housing all rough sleepers – while simultaneously losing vast chunks of income from tax, parking, leisure fees and public transport.Luton Borough Council has seen a projected £33m income from its airport disappear. Without help, its leader has said, it will have to cut 14 per cent of all jobs.“There is already so much misery in the town and behind these stark figures are iniduals with livelihoods and families to care for,” said Hazel Simmons. “Throughout this crisis council staff have shown unbelievable levels of dedication and sacrifice, yet now, through no fault of their own, a number of them are at risk of losing their jobs.

It estimates a further £6bn is needed if the country is not to see a wave of councils going bust.Speaking earlier this month, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said that only support from Whitehall could stop the “2020s being as bad as the 1980s”.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it had provided more than £27bn to support local councils, businesses and communities during the coronavirus pandemic.This included £600m to help reduce the infection rate in care homes and £300m to support track and trace, they added.“We will continue to work closely with councils as they support their communities through this national emergency and we are working on a comprehensive plan to ensure councils’ financial sustainability over the coming year,” the spokesperson said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Their pledges are among the first signs of the corporate sector being impacted by Britain’s recent reckoning with its history of slave trading.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGreene King was founded in 1799 by Benjamin Greene, who was given what amounts to nearly £500,000 in today’s money in return for surrendering the rights to three plantations in the West Indies after the British Empire abolished slavery.He was one of 47,000 people who profited from compensation paid to slave owners after the abolition of slavery in 1833.Tiger King’s Joe Exotic asks BLM to demand prison reformGithub swaps ‘master and slave’ terms for more inclusive languageLiverpool’s Penny Lane ‘could be renamed’ if slave trader links provenNew Orleans protesters rip down bust of slave owner, throw it in riverThere is no excuse for Britain’s barbaric slave tradeGreene King makes no mention of its founder’s links to slavery on its company website, but the company’s chief executive Nick Mackenzie told The  the website would be updated on Thursday.“It is inexcusable that one of our founders profited from slavery and argued against its abolition in the 1800s,” he told the newspaper. “We don’t have all the answers, so that is why we are taking time to listen and learn from all the voices, including our team members and charity partners, as we strengthen our ersity and inclusion work.”Mr Mackenzie said Greene King would invest a “substantial” amount of money “to benefit the Bame community and support our race ersity in the business as we increase our focus on targeted work in this area”.Simon Fraser, a founder subscriber member of Lloyd’s on London, was named in the database as having been paid nearly £400,000 in today’s money when he surrendered an estate in Dominica.A spokesperson for the insurer said: “We are sorry for the role played by the Lloyd’s market in the 18th and 19th-century slave trade. This was an appalling and shameful period of English history, as well as our own, and we condemn the indefensible wrongdoing that occurred during this period.It is time schoolchildren were taught properly about the slave trade“We will provide financial support to charities and organisations promoting opportunity and inclusion for black and minority ethnic groups.”Other companies named on the list that benefited directly or indirectly from the slave trade include the Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays Bank, HSBC, and Lloyds Banking Group.The database was compiled by UCL’s Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-ownership and contains information about every slave-owner in the British Caribbean, Mauritius or the Cape at the moment of abolition.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

They also expect the overall welfare of the UK of the population to be slightly lower as a result of the deal. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA trade agreement with New Zealand could have limited effects on UK GDP in the long run, with the estimated impact on GDP being close to zero under both scenarios compared to the UK not having a trade deal with New Zealand (between 0.00 per cent and 0.01 per cent in scenario 1 and -0.01 per cent and 0.00 per cent in scenario 2), the document says.However the trade deal would be slightly more beneficial to New Zealand itself, the government found, noting that GDP in New Zealand is estimated to see economic growth of 0.14 per cent or 0.35 per cent as a result of this FTA in scenario 1 and 2, respectively.UK and EU agree to intensify trade talks as Brexit deadline loomsExtend Brexit transition period to save stalling trade talks, EU urgesWhile the government expects a trade deal to slightly increase productivity and gross value added, its modelling also warns that not all areas of the country would benefit.In Northern Ireland, output may decrease relative to the baseline, reflecting a higher concentration of the agriculture and semi-processed food sectors, the document says. Exports to New Zealand are expected to increase by between 3.8 per cent and 7.3 per cent under the deal. The government expects there to be a significant increase in imports of New Zealand lamb coming to Britain.Overall the government projects that a substantial deal will reduce the welfare of the population. The document says: Headline welfare changes are limited under scenario 1 and are estimated to decrease by 0.01 per cent in scenario 2.Despite the potential damage to the UK economy from the deal, negotiations were formally launched on Wednesday, alongside talks with Australia.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK economy shrank by 20 per cent in April alone on the back of the coronavirus crisis.The government also admitted in March that its flagship trade deal with Donald Trump\u0027s United States would boost UK GDP by 0.16 per cent. However, the government is keen to sign trade deals with other countries to illustrate the benefits of leaving the European Union\u0027s customs union, in which Britain could not sign its own agreements but benefits from collective deals negotiated by the EU. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: Today\u0027s launch of trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand is a historic moment for this county.When we left the EU we did so on the promise of trading more with friends and allies across the world. Deals with Australia and New Zealand are a powerful expression of our newfound independence and our intent to build a global Britain.

The businesses I speak to around the country simply cannot understand why the government is spending so much time and effort trying to negotiate international trade deals of relatively low value when it is yet to secure our continued trade with Europe. When the 47 per cent of our trade that depends on Europe is still hanging on the balance then that is where the government\u0027s priority should lie.Speaking at the Commons international trade committee on Wednesday, Nick von Westenholz director of EU exit at the National Farmers\u0027 Union said: There is a huge market of 450m consumers on our doorstep in very close proximity so it will remain hugely important market for us. Absolutely we should look for trade opportunities elsewhere around the world in the years ahead but none of those even collectively will make up for the significant damage agriculture might experience if we have a very hard end of the transition period next year. Absolutely the EU negotiation would be our priority.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

China ‘should take a step back’ on Hong Kong, Dominic Raab says“What you’re seeing with the merger is that we want to bring our world-beating aid budget and development expertise we’ve got in DfID right to the beating heart of foreign policy decision making and give not just taxpayers benefit but that have the maximum impact they need at this crucial time,” he said. “So I do think we are learning lessons from the crisis and trying to turn that into the kind of innovation which will sharpen our cutting edge in terms of foreign policy.” Addressing the issue of statues in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, the foreign secretary also told Radio 4’s Today programme that the UK should be careful not to “airbrush” its history, but should “update it”. “One thing I do accept is that people will think that we ought to keep updating our history, and make sure the symbols reflect the spirit and the values of the age,” he added.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHowever, scientists are ided over the value of homemade face coverings.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London, warned that their use might encourage people to wash hands less and to make more use of buses and trains, where face coverings will offer no protection against them being infected by touching handrails contaminated with the virus.“It is now commonly accepted that face coverings provide very little protection, if any. But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will be removed.The decision was praised by California assemblywoman Lorena Gonzales, who also serves as the head of the Latino Caucus.“It’s important that children today learn the difference between real heroes and fake ones,” Ms Gonzales tweeted.The announcement by the leadership comes after statues of Columbus have been taken down across the US, in response to protests around racial injustice.Monuments to Confederate officials have also been removed in numerous states in the past couple of weeks, and House speaker, Nancy Pelosi has called for 11 monuments to be removed from the US Capitol.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In Vietnam, rats are caught in rice fields – some traders breed them in farms with other live animals.For years scientists have warned that the wildlife trade – including wet markets that sell live animals – can harbour infectious diseases such as coronaviruses.The origins of the current Covid-19 pandemic remain contested. However, experts suspect that the disease started in bats and was transferred to another animal before being passed on to humans.The study, published in the bioRxiv journal ahead of peer-review, found six known coronaviruses in samples taken from three southern provinces in Vietnam between 2013 and 2014.New York rats feel the pressure of city livingPositives increased significantly along the supply chain. Around 6 per cent of the rats tested on farms were found to harbour coronaviruses.

And it couldnt come at a greater time of need: with our nation on the brink of the worst ever holiday hunger.The Covid pandemic has had a devastating financial impact on families up and down the country, with millions now struggling to keep a roof over their heads.Parents are, understandably, racked with anxiety over job losses, loved ones health and school closures, which have seen classrooms lie empty for  weeks.And this week, with the summer holidays looming, they faced another worry: how would they feed their children without free school meal vouchers Its a fear Rashford has bravely alleviated.The Man Utd star made an impassioned plea to the Government to prioritise Englands most vulnerable kids by extending the vouchers scheme over the six-week holidays.Under the programme, the families of around . million children eligible for free school meals are given £ a week in vouchers to spend in supermarkets to keep their kids fed.This is not about politics this is about humanity, Rashford wrote in an open letter. Political affiliations aside, can we not all agree that no child should be going to bed hungry The footballer was speaking from real experience: growing up in a low-income household in Manchester, his own family relied on free school meals and breakfast clubs.Today, a similar hand-to-mouth existence is being lived by millions of children across the country. And, in recent months, its been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak.Despite the Governments excellent furlough scheme, , Brits have lost their jobs during lockdown, with unemployment now set to hit the three million mark.As Rashford rightly observes, many families are living on a knes edge, gripped with fear over how they will pay their bills, cover their rent or even put food on the table.This is proven by new data from The Food Foundation, showing that food insecurity in households with children has nearly DOUBLED since the pandemic began.The research also reveals more than , youngsters have been forced to skip meals during lockdown because their family couldn’t access sufficient food.As Chair of the Commons Education Committee, I was delighted when, earlier this year, the Government extended its free school meals scheme for the Easter and May half-term holidays.Yet, like many, I believed its decision to halt the programme for the summer break was wrong.In my view, this was for three key reasons:Firstly, the vouchers have been a leline for many poverty-stricken families during the Covid lockdown. With further worrying and uncertain weeks ahead, these families need consistency.Secondly, and closely linked, is that millions of parents are struggling financially at the moment - something that may be exacerbated in August, when furlough contributions change.Feeding their kids over the summer will push their already stretched budgets to breaking point. Yet these youngsters desperately need, and deserve, nutritional meals.Thirdly, around three million children are at risk of holiday hunger every year .Extending the scheme was simply the right thing to do.It was also relatively easy: yes, its coming out of a £ million Covid Summer Food Fund, but unlike other schemes, it isnt bureaucratic and its understood by parents across England.It also goes to those who need it the most.Studies have shown that food poverty doesnt just impact on childrens health: malnourished kids are less likely to perform as well in the classroom as their better-off peers.This can shape the course of their adult le.England is already facing an educational Ice Ageschools cant open in September - by which point, children will have been out of education for six months.Despite parents home-schooling efforts,  per cent of teachers in the countrys most deprived areas have suggested their students are learning for less than one hour a day.And some , youngsters don’t have access to a computer or tablet at all.Its why Ive called for Alan Turing catch-up summer camps to be set up in school buildings, village halls and marquees - anywhere that can be used to educate our kids.Its also why, despite being a Tory MP, I publicly announced I would vote with Labour today and call on the Government to extend free school meals over the summer.To use a football analogy, it felt strange going to play for the opposite side. But like Rashford, I knew that impoverished families across the UK deserved more.Fortunately, Boris has seen sense, too.Amid this crisis, we need a bold vision from the PM about our childrens education: what are we going to do to get them learning again  How will we get them back to schools We need an exciting, confident agenda, because the next generation depends on it. With todays move, Boris has shown these families that, yes, we do mean business.As for Rashford, he has done as much -not more - for disadvantaged families than any politician. Hes brought a vital issue onto the national stage in a dignied way.Unlike virtue-signalling celebrities who fly on a plane from Los Angeles then go on about saving the environment, he has practised what he preaches.And in doing so, hes shown himself to be a nation icon on and off the pitch.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the majority anyway.Be it scientist “Professor Lockdown” flouting his own advice, or Boris’s svengali Dominic Cummings bending the rules he helped make, the rot set in a couple of weeks ago and has now caused an undeniable fissure between the state and its initially compliant citizens.Yet, while thousands are blatantly breaking social distancing rules at parks, protests and shopping areas, many of them are still being furloughed — at vast taxpayer expense — to “stay home” from work.Whereas common sense dictates that being in an office that’s been health and safety-ed to the nth degree is a far more protected environment than any of the above.And what about schools  The majority of learning for GCSEs and A levels takes place in years  and  respectively, yet government plans for the \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"reopening of secondary schools remain “unclear”, with some reports saying they might not evenin September.Meaning that — on top of GCSEs and A levels being cancelled this year — hundreds of thousands of pupils will be in no position to take them next year either.If teenagers can gather in large, cheek-by-jowl groups at their local park, then surely ing to school isn’t beyond the pale  It might even be safer.As for the hospitality industry, well, not only is the two-metre rule killing it but pubs, in particular, face the galling reality of remaining closed while their beer gardens are used by hordes of people who’ve bought booze at the local supermarket.Enough already. Time, surely, for the Government to open its eyes to what’s happening around the country and exercise some common sense.Of course those who are vulnerable should continue to take as many protective measures as they wish, including remaining furloughed or off schoolnecessary.But the majority should nowto work or schooland start to get Britain back on its feet, both economically and psychologically.SCIENTISTS say that intelligent le could exist on as many as  planets in our galaxy.But they reckon aliens won’t visit Earth because of the distance.The two-week quarantine rules won’t help either.HOLLYWOOD actress Sharon Stone has revealed she was struck by lightening while doing the ironing.What a terrible shock.No, not the estimated billion volts that propelled Sharon across the kitchen, silly.The fact that a movie star was doing her own housework.TATLER magazine’s \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"controversial article on The Duchess of Cambridge proved that snobbery is still alive and kicking in certain sections of the British “upper” classes.Dredging up the age-old “doors to manual” jibe at Kate’s mother Carole, a former member of cabin crew, it also resurrected ancient, alleged whisperings among chinless wonders of her being “NQOCD” – not quite our class, darling.This week, Rosalind Mann died, after a -year career taking photos of posh “girls in pearls” for Country Le magazine.When asked the criteria for posing, she replied: “We never featured anyone whose house had a number.”There’s snobbery in the US too, but it’s largely centred around money, rather than class.In the compellingly vacuous Netflix series Selling Sunset, about a high-end estate agency in Hollywood, the buzz phrase is: “Millionaires have views, billionaires have compounds.”Sadly, I have neither.IN the next James Bond movie, No Time To Die, it’s reported that the legendary spy has a young daughter with Lea Seydoux’s character.Could this see those famous blue trunks being replaced by a papoose It’s tricky waters for Bond fans, with  per cent telling a recent poll that they think it’s a mistake to make the famous philanderer a family man.I’ll reserve judgment until the film is released, but suffice to say, tackling villains such as Le Chfre, Blofeld and Raoul Silva is child’s play compared to dealing with a toddler in meltdown.A PUNTER has placed a bet on Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis becoming PM by the end of .A spokesman for bookmaker Coral said: “The bet took us by surprise but someone’s convinced Maitlis could be the perfect match for No!”Presumably they’re not taking bets on which party she’d stand for as that would be too obvious.RICKY Gervais says that wherever he is in the world, he always frequents Italian restaurants because: “I know it’s going to be good and the same.”We have a similar issue at Moore Towers where – whether we’re at a Greek, French, Chinese, Italian or Japanese restaurant – the Bloke will spend aeons studying the ious culinary delights on offer before ordering “steak and chips” pretty much every time.THE stylist and “best friend” to Meghan Markle, Jessica Mulroney, is embroiled in a race row after appearing to threaten the livelihood of black lestyle blogger Sasha Exeter.Jessica, who has apologised, has now been dropped from regular TV slots and, while the pair have reportedly spoken in private, the Duchess of Sussex has yet to support her friend publicly.Something tells me that, aside from saying: “I need to do better” regarding race and injustice in society, Jessica is about to learn another valuable lesson.Hard times will always reveal true friends.CLOTHING website Missguided has been heavily criticised by shoppers after using slim models to market its plus-range of clothes in sizes  to .One said: “This screams, ‘we want to profit from plus-sized iniduals without representing or supporting them in any way’.” Very true.Equally, those ads for accessible baths showers targeted at the elderly but featuring a woman in her forties with the agility of a mountain goat.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But given this country is facing its worst recession in decades, now is hardly the moment to be sinking taxpayer cash into overseas vanity projects with no possible benefit for Brits. If Boris is determined to stick to David Cameron’s pledge to splash . per cent of GDP on foreign aid, then let’s thank our lucky stars it will now be spent wisely.THREE cheers for Marcus Rashford, a magnicent role model who yesterday won his campaign to make sure Britain’s poorest kids get one square meal a day over the summer. We know it will have been tough for the PM to swallow his pride and U-turn. But it was the right thing to do:  parents struggling to feed their children need all the help they can get right now. And £million — the cost of extending free school meal vouchers during the holidays — is a drop in the ocean when you consider the overall cost of lockdown.We like Rashford’s style, too. How refreshing to see a celebrity using his fame to articulate a powerful argument with such authenticity. NEW unemployment figures make for grim reading. The number of people claiming  jobless benefits more than doubled to hit .million in May — the  highest level since . And because the furlough scheme is masking the true extent of the crisis, we fear the worst is yet to come. Scientists are trained to think about public health  in the narrowest sense. So their instincts tell them to keep Britain in lockdown for as long as possible. But elected politicians know that  poverty and  mass unemployment kill just as surely as the virus. It’s time they showed some leadership and started easing restrictions in earnest. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The amount of children you have helped and saved from being hungry throughout the day are in the hundreds of thousands, another supporter posted.If Rashford is knighted it would make him one of the youngest people ever to receive the honour - seven years younger than tennis champion Sir Andy Murray was when he was given a knighthood.He would join other Manchester United legends including managers Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson and player Sir Bobby Charlton. Rashfords odds of receiving a knighthood plummeted after his charity work during the Covid- pandemic, dropping to  .In a statement addressed to all MPs, Rashford thanked them for giving families one less thing to worry about after the u-turn.This was never about me or you, this was never about politics, this was a cry out for help from vulnerable parents all over the country and I simply provided a  for their voices to be heard, he wrote in the statement shared on social media.I stand proud today knowing that we have listened, and we have done what is right.There is still a long way to go but I am thankful to you all that we have given these families just one less thing to worry about tonight.The wellbeing of our children should ALWAYS be a priority.The PMs spokesperson said yesterday that the Government would run a Covid food fund throughout the summer.He said: “The PM welcomed Marcus Rashford’s contribution to the debate around poverty and I said he would be responding as soon as possible.Owing to the coronavirus pandemic, the PM fully understands that children and parents face an entirely unprecedented situation over the summer.To to reflect this, we will be providing a Covid summer food fund.This will provide food vouchers covering the six week holiday period.This was a specic measure to reflect the unique circumstances of the pandemic.The scheme will not continue beyond the summer and those eligible will be those who already qualy for free school meals.”Ministers have said they will continue with plans to put an additional £million of money into local authorities to help those who cant afford basic essentials.The dramatic u-turn followed England star Rashford penning a heartfelt open letter to the government - urging them to reverse their decision.He wrote: “The Government has taken a ‘whatever it takes’ approach to the economy - I’m asking you today to extend that same thinking to protecting all vulnerable children across England.“I encourage you to hear their pleas and find your humanity.”Rashford, who has raised £ million to boost food distribution with the charity FareShare, revealed how he used food banks and received free meals during his childhood in Manchester.The forward wrote: “We relied on breakfast clubs, free school meals, and the kind actions of neighbours and coaches.“Food banks and soup kitchens were not alien to us - I recall very clearly our visits to Northern Moor to collect our Christmas dinners every year.“As a black man from a low-income family in Manchester, I could have been just another statistic.Make the u-turn and make protecting the lives of some of our most vulnerable a top priority.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government’s decision not to pay for the vouchers was mean-spirited and cheap.But you do wonder about a government which decides upon a policy — and then changes it as soon as a top footballer opens his mouth.Next week, Michael Gove decides to extend trade negotiations with the EU after an intervention by Harry Kane. And lockdown is lted completely when Kyle Walker says he wants to go to another house party.Still, Rashford was right and deserves credit. And he’s right, too, that the Government could go further in helping those of us who live in poverty. The pandemic has thrown the Government off course.It was bound to. But Boris and Co must remember why they were elected last December. They got a huge mandate from our country’s very poorest regions. The areas that usually support the Labour Party.That was partly because of Brexit, of course. And partly because the then Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn , was about as effective as a recently gassed badger.But it was also because Boris promised those former Labour heartlands what they wanted to hear.A closing of the ide between rich and poor, and between London and the rest of the country.Jobs, investment in new industries and transport infrastructure.He might think we’ve all forgotten. But we haven’t. The latest poll shows Labour only five points behind the Conservatives.The honeymoon is over.Boris could begin by increasing the minimum wage for people aged  and over. It is low wages, far more than unemployment, which is keeping people mired in poverty.It wouldn’t cost the Government very much at all. It would also provide a much-needed boost to the economy.An increase in free childcare from  hours per week to  hours would also enable those struggling to make ends meet to get out of the house and work for longer.Shortly after last December’s election, Boris turned up in the North East to give his thanks.He once again promised that the region would be rejuvenated.There’s been good news on some fronts — the Nissan plant at Sunderland, for example, won out over its rival in Barcelona. It will stay open, despite the loss of  jobs.But more needs to be done to attract industry to the North and the Midlands.So far as I can see, the Government has done nothing. OK, it’s had a few problems on its hands.But when this pandemic has passed, the Government will need to intervene to help our economy — the private sector alone cannot do it.And the place to start is away from London — in the places where the new breed of Tory voter lives.Marcus Rashford’s intervention was timely and needed. This Government needs to know the poor are watching and waiting. Waiting for action, waiting for the promises of last year to be delivered.THERE is a stupidity about the woke crowd, trying to ban everything, which defies belief.An old episode of Fawlty Towers was pulled. Because it had some disturbing and potentially offensive racial material in it.But as the star of it, John Cleese, tried patiently to explain – it was SATIRE.The character of Basil Fawlty was the subject of the humour. He was mocked for his idiocies. That’s why we laughed.The episode has now been reinstated – but the moron caravan has already moved on. Now they’ve got it in for Mahatma Gandhi. Racist! The bloke who fought for India’s liberation from British colonialism.Was he a racist  Yes, without much doubt. He took a pretty jaundiced view towards Africans. But the good he did easily outweighs the bad.And believe me, there isn’t a single person born before  who didn’t possess views which today’s society would consider offensive. Regarding race, or gender, or homosexuality. Not one.Why can these people not understand that the past was dferent  And that we judge its heroes in a dferent light There was a really nasty battle between the two sides, with many dead – the first time since .China continues to bully its neighbours and oppress its own people.In this battle, I know whose side I’m on.THE Government has not done much right recently.But at least Boris and Co are binning the Department for International Development.It is to be stripped of its status and merged with the Foreign Office.With any luck, this will mean we will not be giving away any more hard-earned taxpayers’ money to countries like India, which has its own space programme so is clearly not short of a bob or two.Or China – a nasty, totalitarian state and the second richest country in the world.In the last round of spending, we actually bunged money into a programme to help Chinese people improve their diets.Nope, not kidding.I wonderit mentioned anything about it maybe not being a great idea to eat bats Various studies have suggested these donations are worthless and often counter-productive.I think, right now, we need to spend money at home, no SCIENTISTS from Japan have predicted that within  years we will be able to understand what animals are thinking. We will be communicating with them.Uh-oh. Not sure that’s good. Imagine a chat with a wasp . . .“Hi, Mr Wasp. What you doing ”“I’m crawling up your window. What’s it to you  And it’s Ms Wasp, as it happens. I’ve transitioned. So don’t misgender me. Now, p*** off before I sting you on the neck.”Worse with cats. “LOVE you  WTF, I’ve never even liked you. You’re mugs, humans. Just put the food out and give me a warm place to sleep and I’ll purr for a bit to keep you happy. Now, excuse me. I’m going to sleep on the roof of the shed for six hours.”But I might start watching it now as the cast all seem to hate each other.The soap has been torn apart by rows over the Black Lives Matter debate.Lysette Anthony has taken loads of flack and her co-star Rachel Adedeji has described her as “actual trash”.Hmm . . . somehow I suspect the show will not be anywhere near as interesting as the row.NOT everything about lockdown has been bad. Far from it.My we hasn’t been to TK Maxx for three months, for a start. There’s a mercy.And we’re not using cash. There’s little indication we will need to use cash ever again.Those people who aren’t on the breadline have saved money.And then there’s offices. Will we really go back to that awful daily commute, when the vast majority of jobs can, these days, be done at home  Just think how many homes we could createwe converted all those empty offices into flats.Offices were created because we needed a place to store paper files. Don’t really need that now, do we The Government should encourage firms to move to home-working, when – the stats suggest – employees are a lot more productive.IN France – a country almost as badly hit by Covid- as the UK – the schools will be reopening on Monday. By law, no arguments. Full curriculum.Over here, meanwhile, there are suggestions that some schools will not be opening until JANUARY and will not open properly for a year. Incredible.The Government needs to get a grip of this right now, as I argued last week.Call the bluff of the horrible trade unions and get our kids back to school.

To do something of meaning, to do something that matters.Archewell is a name that combines an ancient word for strength and action, and another that evokes the deep resources we each must draw upon.They added: We look forward to launching Archewell when the time is right.The non-profit aims to offer classes, lectures, seminars, conferences, workshops, and retreats on a iety of topics, run a mentoring scheme, or conduct and host events and exhibitions for cultural, sporting, health, mental health and entertainment purposes, as well as the potential to self-publish articles, magazines, books, music, podcasts, television shows, and computer software.According to reports this week, they have delayed their plans until at least next year, as they focus their efforts on the Black Lives Matter movement and fighting COVID-.Describing how a public launch is now off the cards, a source told the Daily : Whats absolutely clear is that they want to get it right and theres no point in rushing.They are settling into a new le, a new era.

It’s just easier than trying to do the school work.“It’s a way of escaping from everything.“I’m worried the teachers will be disappointed in me because I haven’t done enough work.“I’m worried I’ll fall behind and have to resit the year when all my friends go on.”And he is not alone. A study by University College London revealed that two million children have done barely any schoolwork at home.Since March, around  per cent of pupils have done none, or less than an hour, a day. And just  per cent put in more than four hours a day.Finn’s mum Kerrie, , a former secondary school teacher, admits she only ever sees her son at meal times.The single mum, who also has daughters Imogen, , and six-year-old Elodie, has found it hard to juggle home-schooling with working full-time as a social worker.She says: “When lockdown started I thought I’d be able to manage, especially because I used to be a teacher.“I was really motivated and ordered lots of stuff on Amazon to help. I think because the kids could see I was motivated it rubbed off on them.“But as time has gone on it’s become more dficult and challenging. I can’t give  per cent to my job and  per cent to teaching my kids. It’s just not possible.”Now Finn usually gets up around .am, has breakfast then switches on his games console — and stays up until midnight.Kerrie says: “I tried to get Finn to do schoolwork. With not enough computers for me and the kids to work, I even set written work for him.“But I couldn’t make him do it, no matter how much I encouraged him.” As we report today, more than , child health experts have signed an open letter to Boris Johnson demanding the Government publishes a clear plan to get all youngsters back to school as soon as possible or “risk scarring the le chances of a generation of young people”.The letter, organised by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, warns children are “suffering enormously” from a lack of access to exercise, vaccinations and mental health support.m have done under an hour’s work a day, experts warn PM it will ‘scar a generation’This is par­ti­cu­larly concern­ing for Clare Cashion, , when it comes to -year-old daughter Libby.Clare, a civil servant from Worcester, who is also mum to Ollie, , Lochlan, four, and two-year-old Cullann, says: “Libby has gone from being a  hardworking student to a changed character, so I do worry about her wellbeing.”Libby now stays awake until am and usually gets up at about lunchtime. Instead of doing schoolwork, she spends most of her time talking to friends on social media.She says: “At first we didn’t know what we were supposed to be doing, and because there wasn’t proper work or anyone to check your work and because you can’t just ask questions, I didn’t want to do it.“When I did do it, I didn’t get any feedback, and then my friends would tell me they hadn’t bothered, so I just thought, ‘What’s the point ’.“I’m a huge worrier and I am concerned about falling behind, but I’d rather stay up and talk to friends on my phone. That’s when everyone is online.“Mum tries to make me do more schoolwork but it doesn’t work. There just doesn’t seem much point at the moment. “I’d just like to go back to school.”In a report last month, government advisory body Sage warned lockdown had caused a “shock” to kids that will last the rest of their lives and affect work opportunities.The report also confirmed the risk of children catching coronavirus was “much lower” than adults.Yesterday, MPs on the Education Select Committee accused teaching unions of running a “disgraceful political campaign” to keep classrooms closed by “cherry picking” evidence to make parents fear schools are “death traps”.Chairman Robert Halfon asked: “Can you explain why parents and children can have access to Primark over the coming weeks and months but not to schools ”For Libby and Clare, it will be a big relief when schools can reopen. Clare says: “School has now started online lessons, so one week they’ll be live, and  Libby has taken part in some, but the following week it’s just emails and sometimes they have to cancel.“I think Libby struggles with not knowing exactly what’s expected.”Finn is just as desperate to get back in the classroom.He said: “I really want to go back to school because it’s a lot easier to learn in a classroom with a teacher explaining the work, and I miss my independence.“I’ve found it really dficult being at home this long.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An estimated one in five adults and one in six children dont get enough vitamin D - a problem that its feared could be being exacerbated by the lockdown. One study by Anglia Ruskin University found that European countries in which vitamin D deficiency is prevalent have seen elevated death tolls since the start of the pandemic. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, part of the Department of Health, has now announced a rapid evidence review looking at the trend, thereported. The results of the review are set to be published in the coming weeks. The Scientic Advisory Committee on Nutrition, which advises Public Health England and other government organisations on nutrition, will also complete a report. Heightened vulnerability caused by a lack of vitamin D could be part of the reason that both the elderly and certain ethnic minority groups have seen higher fatality rates from the virus.Melanin, the pigment that makes a persons skin darker, lowers the skins ability to produce vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure. The bodys ability to produce the vitamin also diminishes as a person gets older.  In April, Public Health England advised Brits to begin taking vitamin D supplements to help maintain bone and muscle health during the lockdown.Earlier this month, the Scottish government also recommended that anyone from an ethnic group with darker skin should begin taking the supplement. Officials are said to be discussing whether the supplement could be prescribed in hospitals to help mitigate the impact of any second wave.Professor Adrian Martineau of Queen Mary University, currently leading a study into the vulnerability to coronavirus of people with dferent lestyles, told the \" href\"https:www.the world  jun  uk-ministers-order-urgent-vitamin-d-coronavirus-review\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\" that the benefits of vitamin D could be considerable. Vitamin D could almost be thought of as a designer drug for helping the body to handle viral respiratory infections, he said.

There are also signs of growing economic inequality as the pandemic has affected the lives of some more than others. An estimated . million people say their households have been affected financially by coronavirus, a similar share compared with the start of lockdown, the report found. Overall, economic and financial expectations have fallen to levels not seen since , according to the ONS, which produced the figures to shed light on the impact of the pandemic on people and households across Britain. Expectations for the general economic situation fell particularly sharply between the period before lockdown in March and April, and then fell further in May.

The Foreign Secretary said he thinks itaposs a symbol of subjugation and subordination - and bizarrely claimed the gesture against police violence was from the Game of Thrones. He added: [I] take the knee for two people - the Queen, and the missus when I asked her to marry me. After Labour branded the comments insulting and deeply embarrassing Mr Raab issued a statement on Twitter. He said: To be clear: I have full respect for the Black Lives Matter movement, and the issues driving them. If people wish to take a knee, that’s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: The Foreign Secretary was very clear he was expressing a personal opinion. He added: I think heaposs spoken about how he respects the fact that people may wish to take a knee and he said we all need to come together. Asked for the PMaposs own view of taking a knee, the spokesman added: Heaposs set out his views on the protests and the very strong sentiment which has been expressed over the past few weeks. Heaposs spoken about it at . And weaposre in the process of setting up the race commission in order to set out a positive agenda for change. The comments by the UKaposs chief diplomat - who is Boris Johnsonaposs deputy - sparked a fresh row over the governmentaposs response to Black Lives Matter protests.  Kneeling in protest for black people was popularised as a gesture in  by former San Francisco ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. He knelt in protest against police brutality during the national anthem, prompting a furore over civil rights in the US. Kaepernick later said: I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour. “To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” But asked by TalkRadio todayhe would take a knee, Mr Raab said: I understand this sense of frustration and restlessness which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement. Iaposve got to say on this taking a knee thing, I donapost know, maybe itaposs got a broader history but seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones, feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel dferently about it so itaposs a matter of personal choice. Asked againheaposd do it he said: [I] take the knee for two people - the Queen, and the missus when I asked her to marry me. It is not clear why Mr Raab thought the gesture was from Game of Thrones - although the show does include people kneeling in subjugation to a new ruler.  Twitter users accused Mr Raab of being ignorant and said his comments were absolutely disgraceful... white privilege in Ultra HD. TV host Piers Morgan tweeted: Unbelievable.. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab thinks taking the knee is from Game of Thrones. This Government continues to shame us to the world. Shadow Justice Secretary David Lammy tweeted: This is not just insulting to the #BlackLivesMatter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab. He is supposed to be the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom.  Labour MP Diane Abbott said: “Taking the knee began in  with American athletes refusing to stand for US national anthem. “They were protesting police brutality and racism. “But Dominic Raab thinks it comes from Game of Thrones!!! Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said: The fact our Foreign Secretary, who is also now going to be in charge of our aid budget, is totally ignorant about a global movement against racism is as shocking as it is concerning. SNP MP Stephen Flynn tweeted a ‘face palm’ emoji adding: “He says he ‘understands’ but then goes on to say that he thinks take the knee comes from Game of Thrones. “How can the actual Foreign Secretary not know about Colin Kaepernick ” "},{"url":null,"title":"emmanuel macron arrives uk ahead","story":"NewsEmmanuel Macron arrives in UK ahead of holiday air bridge talks with Boris JohnsonThe French President arrived to mark the anniversary of Charles de Gaulles \"Appel\" - but the UKs coronavirus quarantine system will also be on the tableShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political EditorHarriet Line:,  JUN NewsThe French President is marking an important anniversary \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Thousands of youngsters, particularly those from disadvantaged families, face a ruined educationthey are not able tosafely in September.We urge the PM to find alternative class space, fund extra teachers, give poor kids free internet and help those who have fallen behind. Lib Dem Layla Moran said: “Schools need more resources. Mr Johnson needs to take responsibility for this shambles.” As millions of children face six months out of class, medical and educational chiefs are also urging the PM to give schools the resources they need to reopen this autumn. Union leaders, medical and education chiefs, backed by the Mirror’s campaign, are warning that the poorest and most vulnerable children will struggle to close the attainment gap. Prof Russell Viner, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said top doctors have a “very real concern” for children’s health. More than , paediatricians have also signed an unprecedented open letter to the PM, calling for a clear plan for getting children back to school. Teachers’ leaders warned yesterday that England’s schools would not be able to fully reopen after the summer holidays under current distancing rules requiring just  pupils in a class. Today, the Mirror is calling for the Government to work with parents, teachers, education unions and council leaders to get children back into school. We want ministers to to find alternative spaces, such as church halls, community centres, sports venues and libraries to give schools the space they need to maintain social distancing. Heads should be given funding to hire extra staff, including supply and trainee teachers and –it’s safe for them – recently retired teachers. The poorest children should be given free internet and equipment to narrow the ide, so no child is left behind.  And we need a massive catch-up programme to run over the over the summer, and beyond, to help those who have missed out on education at home. Prof Viner said: “Children need their schools. Every child deserves to have an uninterrupted education. But teachers do so much more than teach and schools provide so much more than education. Schools are vital to the wellbeing of children, providing a range of services from vaccinations to mental health support. Schools are also where at-risk children are looked out for and supported. Schools are also where our children run around, play and laugh and argue with each other. They need toto that sort of a healthy normality as soon as possible.”  Lib Dem’s education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said: “Making our High Streets Covid-secure is critical. But it seems the Prime Minister is more concerned about allowing betting shops to re-open than getting children safely back into school. “It shows where the Government’s priorities lie. Schools urgently need the resources for more space and staff so that more pupils cansafely. Boris Johnson needs to take responsibility for this shambles, work with teachers and experts to agree a plan and stop treating our schools like a political football.” Labour Leader Keir Starmer told the Mirror: “It was Education Secretary Gavin Williamson who said on June  we’re not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer. I have said repeatedly that I want schools to reopen as soon as possible. I’ve offered to work with the Prime Minister to address this issue.” Coronavirusandschools.org.uk is giving parents and carers educational advice from real teachers while the schools are closed. The website has been set up by the National Education Union who represent almost half a million teachers and support staff. It features video tips from teachers, QAs on exams and tests, learning at home and child wellbeing. Plus there are fun activities parents can do with their children to stimulate their brains and keep them learning.  Click here to check it out for advice, resources and useful links. Mr Starmer, who has sent his own children to school through the lockdown because his we works for the NHS, added: “This is a Government with a majority of , it has its responsibilities and it should be doing everything in its power to reopen schools as soon as possible. The PM wants all England’s children back in school from September, after six months of coronavirus disruption. But he has tried to sht the blame for the fact that many of those in the years that are eligible tohave not yet done so.  Government plans to bring in Years R,  and  are in chaos, and a third of England’s primary failed to do so by June . Proposals to bring back Years , ,  and  by the start of July had to be dropped after officials accepted there was not enough space to maintain social distancing. Distancing rules have left schools scrambling to find space and rope in support staff to lead lessons. Ministers have been urged to adopt more creative proposals, including taking a Nightingale approach – based on the temporary hospitals set up to treat Covid- patients – to schools by providing extra space in community centres and town halls.  They have also been told to make sure heads have enough funding to encourage recently retired and supply teachers back into the classroomit is safe for them to do so. Downing Street is planning to set out its “catch up” plans for the summer later this week, and further plans “within weeks” to get more children back into the classroom after the summer holidays. The PM’s official spokesman said: “The PM has set out a very clear message… school is safe and he wants parents to send their children back to school. We’ll continue to encourage parents to have their kids back in school and I’m sure those numbers will continue to rise.” But Mr Johnson suggested that Labour and the trade unions were hampering efforts to reopen. He said: “The kids that can go to school, should go to school and wouldn’t it be a fine thingwe heard from all sides of the House that schools are safe to go to, rather than the wibble-wobble that we’ve heard from the Opposition ” But four education unions being quizzed by the Commons Education committee hit back, and demanded more clarity and action from the Government.  Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, warned MPs something would have to givethe Government wanted schools to open fully in September under current rules. “If the Government retains its social distancing rules, then they can’t [opne],” she said. “So that’s why we then need to look at an education recovery plan, which is focused on more than school buildings. “[It’s] about increasing the physical footprint of the school, about increasing the numbers of teachers available to teach smaller classes, and about a national plan for blended learning.” Jon Richards, National Secretary at Unison, said “you have to have facilities set up” and there were still “serious issues” around cleaning and canteens. Julie McCulloch, of the ASCL union, said: “If it’s at all possible and considered safe then absolutely we want all children to be back in school from September. “That is by far the best solution. But we’re not able to do that at the moment within the Government’s own protective measures guidance. The maths just doesn’t work.” "},{"url":null,"title":"home office interpreter laughed tried","story":"NewsHome Office interpreter laughed as I tried to recount being raped torture survivor claimsEXCLUSIVE: Harrowing testimonies in a report by charity Freedom from Torture says people fleeing persecution are treated like criminals in asylum interviews - with the charity saying lessons have not been learned from the Windrush scandalShareByDave Burke:,  JUN NewsThe Home Office is accused of treating torture survivors in an inhumane manner during asylum interviews\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The allegation comes from charity Freedom from Torture in a report published today but are denied by the Home Office, with a spokesman saying they do not recognise them.  Interpreters are not Home Office staff but employed on a contract basis.It is one of a harrowing series of accounts highlighted in the study, which alleges victims of torture are being sent back into the clutches of their abusers because of prejudice and poor information gathering. The study, by charity Freedom from Torture, warns there is an environment of disbelief, scepticism and suspicion at the Home Office - which means vulnerable asylum seekers fleeing persecution are being failed. The action group said inhumane treatment shows lessons have not been learned from the Windrush scandal. In one heartbreaking testimony, a rape survivor described a shocking exchange during her asylum interview, saying: There was a point when I was going to talk about rape and when I started to talk about it, the interpreter snickered and when I saw that, it stopped me in my tracks… It was like it was funny. I wasnapost joking. I couldnapost understand this behaviour. Describing the aggressive questioning they had endured, another said: I was crying out loud and shaking and literally lost myself in a room… Oh, my goodness gracious. So many questions. … I said, ‘Could you please stop talking about it  I can’t do that.’ He said, ‘No. I’m sorry. We have to ask you and you have to answer’. I was like a kid. Another incident saw a sobbing asylum seeker asked to say exactly how many times they had been beaten and raped, the report states. Freedom from Torture has called for a systematic overhaul of the asylum interview process, describing the treatment many applicants receive as inhumane. Following publication of the report, named aposBeyond Belief: How the Home Office fails survivors of torture at the asylum interviewapos, the charity said: More often than not torture survivors left the asylum interview feeling dehumanised, re-traumatised, and felt hopeless at getting a fair decision on their asylum claim.  According to the report, one torture survivor recounted: The caseworker didn’t even look at me at all. Not for a second. Not at all. He was treating me like a criminal. The charity said the high number of cases where asylum applications are rejected, only to be allowed on appeal demonstrate systematic failings. Its report concluded: A system that relies on the appeal process to correct its errors is inefficient, costly and inhumane. And the charity said: Home Office caseworkers who conduct interviews have a dficult job, dealing as they do with traumatic stories and vulnerable iniduals every day. There is no doubt, however, that the culture within the Home Office has created an environment of disbelief, scepticism and suspicion that has crept into the interview room.  Despite all the statements of regret from government ministers following exposure of the Windrush scandal, we are still waiting for the systemic overhaul that has been called for by so many of those with lived experience of the immigration process. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these allegations.We have a proud history of supporting asylum seekers and our caseworkers follow the latest Home Office guidance and receive extensive training before they are permitted to conduct asylum interviews."},{"url":null,"title":"patronising tory mp ordered apologise","story":"NewsPatronising Tory MP ordered to apologise for failing to declare directorshipsA standards report found Marcus Fysh made three breaches of the code of conduct for MPs - and took a patronising tone to the officials investigating himShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsTory MP Marcus Fysh has been ordered to apologise in Parliament \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Marcus Fysh, , was investigated over failing to declare the directorships on the Register of MPsapos Interests or reveal them to a select committee. The Commons Committee on Standards today found he made three breaches of the Code of Conduct for MPs. The watchdog said he was late to registering changes to three companies in which he had shareholdings should have registered his five unpaid directorships in  and should have declared his and his brother’s unpaid directorships to the International Trade and European Scrutiny committees when he joined them. In a damning judgement, the Committee said Mr Fysh did not act in bad faith - but there were aggravating factors once a probe began. The Committee said Mr Fysh took a deprecatory and, at points, patronising tone towards the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner and raised unfounded questions about their objectivity. There were also unnecessary delays when he did not respond to requests in a timely manner - including missing four deadlines to reply. Mr Fysh accepted the conclusion about his shareholdings and apologised, but not the two conclusions about his directorships. That meant the matter was elevated from the lower-level Commissioner to MPs on the Commons Standards Committee. In total, the inquiry that began in October  took almost two years to complete.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is expected to announce a major catch-up programme for England tomorrow after kidsapos schooling was derailed by coronavirus. Boris Johnson has said the plan will be massive and stretch over the summer and beyond. Now the first - unconfirmed - details of the scheme have been reported.reports schools will be given a multi-million pound government fund to hire thousands of private agency tutors. Under a year-long scheme, they would offer one-to-one and small group lessons to pupils who have fallen behind after months out of school. Meanwhile, the Daily Mail reports the bolt-on learning will take the form of sessions at the end of the school day. That would mean while the school day wouldnapost be formally extended, many pupils would be kept at school for longer. That would come on top of the staggered arrival and finish times schools are already having to implement to maintain social distancing.  A Whitehall source told the newspaper: The best place for children to learn is in a school environment, so it makes sense to try and do catch-up work at school rather than trying to do it through home learning. There has rightly been a lot of focus on the impact on disadvantaged children but all children have missed out on their education so we need a catch-up programme that is open to everyone. A senior government source did not deny todayaposs reports, saying only that they were speculation. The PM’s official spokesman declined to confirm details, but said: “It’s far to say we’re looking at a range of measures to help children make up for the time they’ve spent out of school.” He added it will cover not just the summer period, but “September and beyond”. It comes as the Daily Mirror today launches a campaign for the government to take urgent action to get all our children back in school.  Union leaders, medical and education chiefs are warning the poorest and most vulnerable children will struggle to close the attainment gap. Prof Russell Viner, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said top doctors have a “very real concern” for children’s health. A report by UCLaposs Institute of Education found two million children have done less than an hour a day of schoolwork during lockdown, amid mounting fears for kidsapos long-term chances. More than , paediatricians have also signed an unprecedented open letter to the PM, calling for a clear plan for getting children back to school.

The home in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, looks ordinary from the outside, but inside it is packed with newspapers dating back to , stopped clocks, a half-smoked pipe, and the owneraposs shoes left by the bed years after the property was vacated. Photographer Rebecca was invited in to see the decaying cottage after its owner died and she was left in awe of the haunting scenes within the perfectly preserved home. The cottage was lived in until  by the last of three brothers, who kept all of their family history, alongside tins of food from the early th century left unopened on the kitchen shelves.A man only identied as Dessie was the last to live there, leading aposa solitary le among the relics of the pastapos before moving into a home in  and passing away two years later. Rebecca, who owns the Abandoned NI website sharing photos of the derelict houses she explores, was allowed in by the owner to get a record of the incredible space before it was knocked down to make way for a new build. She said she was left gobsmacked by what she found, with old books, magazines, papers and photographs littered around the farm workeraposs cottage and left untouched. A clock on the mantel piece is stuck showing ., a pair of glasses are left ready to pick up and a rusted OXO tin has been left open, with two pocket watches stored inside. Hundreds of handwritten letters fill the drawers, and three kettles are sat on the stove, next to a cup which appears to have been placed there just before it was abandoned. Old books and newspapers including the Mid Ulster Mail from  were left sitting in the living room which had been shut off for more than  years, alongside one newspaper which reported the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic in . Upstairs there remained rotting bedclothes, a bed pan on the floor and a flat cap left hanging on the end of a bedframe. Rebecca said she initially wasnapost surethe interior would be very interesting, but she has now created an exhibition based on the lives of Dessie and his family.  She said: I have to admit I saw the outside and wasnapost sureit was worth it. As soon as I opened the door I was blown away. I went into what I thought was a wee cottage and itaposs basically a social history museum. The cottage first appeared on maps in  and Rebecca began researching the family to help piece together the puzzle in all of the photographs. After talking to people to find out more about Dessie, she said: Among many things he was a fabulous cook, many friends still talk about his famous soda bread which he cooked over the original stove. He was a hearty farmer, milking cows to produce milk and butter.It was reportedyou stayed for dinner in the house and you finished up, you were given another dinner for seconds.No one left with an empty stomach. One of the mysteries Rebecca was able to solve was personal items belonging to an Edwin McQueen, who she was able to discover was married to Dessieaposs mum. He worked as a policeman, and a certicate from  and a framed picture of him in his unorm was found in one of the bedrooms.

Questions such as aposWhere you going on holiday apos or aposWhat you up to this weekend apos are to be discouraged during hair washing. Instead,they get the go-ahead to reopen in early July, hairdressers are being asked to observe a apossilence ruleapos. The National Hair and Beauty Federationhas advised members to keep chat to a minimum to protect both staff and customers. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   It comes as the federation is urging the Government to publish full guidance as salons will need two weeks to redesign. In a letter to Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, NHBF has expressed disappointment that “despite a real sense of progress” no official guidance is yet available. One hairdressing group, meanwhile, has already told its staff not to talk to customers whilst theyaposre having their hair washed and head massaged. Contemporary Salons, which has shops throughout the North East and North Yorkshire will make sure all staff have PPE.  Customers will also take part in a aposvirtual consultationapos so theof appointment can be assessed. Alan Simpson, Managing Director, said salons would be looking at aposmaintenance appointmentsapos to begin with before making more complicated sessions available in the coming weeks. No formal decision has been made by the Prime Minister on when salons and barber shops will be allowed to reopen. The National Hair and Beauty Federationare advising members to talk to clients side by side looking into the mirror and to limit discussions. Their advice issued to barbers and walk-in salons is: Avoid face-to-face discussions with clients. Discussions about cut, colour and treatments should be made via the mirror while standing behind the client and kept to a minimum. You can lower the risk of infectionyou stand or sit side-to-side rather than facing people. Consider offering online consultations to reduce the appointment time. “This could be done before your salon or barbershop is fully open for business. This also gives you an opportunity to talk to clients about safety measures you’re taking to protect them and your team and to establishan allergy alert test is needed.Other tips include urging customers not to bring coats or jackets into salonsthe weather is good because the virus can stay on fabrics for days.And salons have been encouraged to put out a slotted container for tips. A spokesman for NHBF said: Salons are putting their own rules in place based on common sense and trying to limit contact with clients as much as possible.

The Wild Planet Trust said it could no longer afford to reopen its Living Coasts site in Torquay, Devon, due to the huge cost of the coronavirus lockdown. It means  jobs are likely to be lost, while staff at Paignton Zoo and Newquay Zoo - which are owned by the same trust - are also at risk. The Devon site was home to a range of animals, including South American fur seals, African penguins, macaroni penguins, sea ducks, pied avocet, redshanks, black-necked stilts, ruffs, and terns. In a statement the trust said it regretted having to make the decision to close, but the attraction was no longer viable. It wrote on the Trustaposs website: Falling visitor numbers and the forced closure of all its zoos due to COVID- has meant that it has had to look at its cost base and make efficiencies. After nearly twenty years of operation the site also needed substantial maintenance that the Trust is no longer in a position to afford. It now means animals will have to be moved - but it is not yet clear how long this will take.  The site is home to a penguin beach, a tropical mangrove swamp, and underwater viewing areas. The statement said: The next stage is to find homes for the animals. Living Coasts is part of a world-wide network of zoos and aquariums and we will be looking for homes for the animals within them once movement restrictions have been lted.Most of the animals kept at Living Coasts are marine species that will need specialist facilities. Living Coast is confident that good new homes for the animals will be found, but at present it is unclear how long this process may take.

A blueprint for socially-distanced al fresco dining has been unveiled by Westminster City Council as Britainaposs coronavirus lockdown eases. It has outlined plans to close roads and replace traffic with tables and chairs in proposals inspired by Barcelona and Paris. The council says it could enable pubs and restaurants desperate to fling open their doors to get back in business in weeks by allowing them to spill out into the streets. Under the proposal, Londonaposs West End would be transformed by summer into a temporary socially-distant outdoor dining and drinking spot as the UK coronavirus lockdown eases. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here The council has asked for public feedback on its plans to reopen one of Britainaposs busiest nightle spots with special social distancing measures in place. Under its proposals, roads will be closed to traffic in some parts of popular entertainment hot-spots Soho, Covent Garden and Chinatown, to allow pubs, bars and restaurants to use more outdoor space. The council released its proposal in the week the UKaposs non-essential shops were allowed to finally reopen. Restaurants and pub bosses in the capital had feared having to stay closed until autumn while continuing to bleed rent cash, due to ongoing lockdown restrictions. The council proposed the plans as a hospitality industry in crisis lobbies the government for an answer on a potential July  timeline to reopen pubs and breweries.  Its al fresco dining plans will allow bars and restaurants expand their businesses outside for European-style socialising, without their owners having to jump through the ordinary licencing hoops. The council drew up the proposal after lobbying from Londonaposs hospitality sector. According to My London, streets with high densities of restaurants will have marked areas for placing tables and chairs to “avoid clashes”. Venues that do not already have a licence for outside dining and drinking will still need to apply for one, but new applications will be “fast tracked”, the council said. Punters will be allowed inside venues to use toilets. The council may even place portaloos outside, but warned it would charge businesses for the service. In Soho and Covent Garden,  inidual streets will have outside dining until pm from Monday to Saturdays, and until .pm on Sundays.  Areas such as St James’s, Mayfair and Marylebone will also be given “soft” measures to close them between fixed hours, using cones and removable barriers. Marshals will also be stationed to ensure safety. Council leader Rachael Robathan said: “The hospitality sector is vital to Westminster’s economy with more than , bars and restaurants. They, and our many other attractions, are the reason people fly thousands of miles to enjoy the West End. “So we are doing what we can to support our hospitality business through the vital summer months and into the autumn. The residents’ groups we have spoken to have been very supportive as they know this is a temporary measure for the benefit of all of Westminster.  “The West End in particular is a unique global draw, and I am confident we can give it and our other famous locations a continental sheen that visitors, residents and regulars alike will enjoy.” The authority council had come under fire after the proposals were unveiled this week. Reports claiming it was going to ban punters from standing with pints outdoors. But the council has rejected the claims, insisting it wasnapost banning aposvertical drinking.apos Westminster claried the measures restricting standing boozing outside pubs would only affect the brand new outdoor dining spots it was planning.  Pubs that already have permission for punters to drink alcohol while standing outside on the pavements could continue to do so. Businesses would also be able to seek new permission to allow aposverticalapos drinking,they could show they could do so safely, the council added. Its proposals come as the hospitality industry begs the government to reduce the two-metre rule to get punters back indoors.

Head teacher Michelle Pollard told Surrey Live she is disappointed for families that these measures have had to be taken, in particular at a time when some normality was ing for our children.Parents were also reassured by the school that the risk of infection was low. Other members of the household are able to continue as normal, provided that the child or staff member does not develop symptoms within the -day period. Mrs Pollard said in a statement: As head teacher, I am disappointed for our families that we have had to take these measures at a time when some normality was ing for our children.

Amid rising racial tensions in Bristol, two headstones marking the burial place of -year-old Scipio Africanus, who lived in the city in the th century, were smashed up and message was left reading: Put Colstonaposs statue back or things will really heat up. It comes after the statue of th century slave trader Edward Colston was toppled in the centre of the city earlier this month during Black Lives Matter protests, and a statue to Jamaican playwright and actor Alfred Fagon was attacked with bleach.A message scrawled in chalk near the Scipio Africanus grave  included a warning for Black Lives Matter demonstrators and the local council, the Bristol Post reports. to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.     Written on flagstones near the grave, it read: Now look at what you made me do. Stop protesting. Leave Elliottaposs grave alone. Put Colstonaposs statue back or things will really heat up. Police have launched an investigation and are reviewing CCTV from the area. The Grade II-listed, brightly painted memorial to Scipio, who died in , is situated in St Maryaposs churchyard in Henbury, Bristol. The tomb is an early example of a memorial to a man born into slavery and who ended his le as a servant in an English aristocratic household, Historic England states on its website.  It is thought the reference to Elliottaposs grave is music hall star GH Elliott, who used to perform in blackface as the aposChocolate Coloured C**napos. The gravestones of Elliott and and fellow music hall singer Alice Banford, who also wore blackface, were inscribed with their offensive stage names, and both were removed from St Margaretaposs Church in Rottingdean, East Sussex, on Monday. Their removal was authorised by the Chancellor of Chichester Diocese. It came after the Archdeacon of Brighton and Lewe, Martin Lloyd Williams, said he wanted to remove the deeply offensive gravestones. Banfordaposs gravestone, previously located next to Elliottaposs, was engraved with the words C**n singer and dancer. The performers both died in . In Bristol, the councillor who represents the ward that is home to the slaveaposs desecrated grave is now appealing for anyone who witnessed the latest vandalism to contact the police.Sharing a photo of the desecrated spot on Facebook, Cllr Mark Weston said: Sadly late last night the listed grave of aposScipio Africanusapos in St Maryaposs Churchyard, Henbury was badly damaged.This looks like a retaliation attack for the recent events involving the Colston statue. I am deeply saddened by what is happening.We have seen war memorials defaced and statues vandalised and I have to wonder where this will end. Our history is not simple, and a personaposs actions are rarely clear cut. Our nationaposs past is an intricate web of greatness, atrocity, heroism and villainy. We have good people that do bad things, bad people that occasionally strive for redemption and everything in between. This confusion becomes especially evident as we apply the lens of modern morality to the actions of centuries past.  If anyone has any information on this latest vandalism then I would urge you to contact the police. Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees has called for calm and urged people not to carry out tit for tat racially motivated attacks. He said: [Scipioaposs grave] is an iconic piece of Bristolaposs history and that has been smashed in two with a message left scrawled on the floor around that. We just donapost want to go down the route. We donapost want to go down this tit-for-tat invisible attacks on each other. Little is known about Scipio, who was servant to Charles Howard, the th Earl of Suffolk. Historians believe he was the son of an enslaved West African woman. He was given his name by the Earl or by a previous owner. It is thought he was named after the Roman general Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, known for defeating the Carthaginian military leader Hannibal in the third century. Names of Roman origin were frequently chosen for enslaved people, Historic England states. Most of the available information about Scipio is inscribed on his tomb, according to Historic Englandaposs website. The headstone, which features black cherubs, states he was born in about  and died on December  . Howard had a large house in the Henbury area. It is thought that Scipio was a well-loved member of the household. It was rare for an enslaved person to have a formal grave within a churchyard - let alone such an ornate one.  An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said: We have received a report of criminal damage to a monument at Henbury Parish Church. We believe the incident occurred between pm on Tuesday  June and am on Wednesday  June. Our investigation into what happened is at an early stage.Officers have been at the scene and have carried out house-to-house and CCTV enquiries.  Anyone with information is asked to call  and give reference number .” Demonstrators used roped to pull down the Colston statue, erected in , during protests in Bristol city centre on June . It was then rolled into Bristol Harbour near Peroaposs Bridge - named in honour of enslaved man Pero Jones who lived and died in the city - and retrieved by the council on June . The act sparked a debate over the future of statues and monuments which celebrate long-dead figures who were involved in the slave trade."},{"url":null,"title":"words no action politicians act","story":"NewsAll words and no action: when will our politicians act on animal abuses \"Im totally disillusioned by a process that seems to go nowhere\" - puppy campaignerShareCommentsByAndrew Penman:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsSheep inside a truck at Ramsgate before being loaded onto a ferry \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

They will have travelled from Scotland and once across the Channel will continue their gruelling journey through France and into Spain and possibly beyond, into North Africa, where the animals can be slaughtered in unspeakable conditions. It will be the first shipment of livestock from the port since March . Lockdown put a temporary halt to this dreadful trade, sometimes in sheep and sometimes in calves so young that they have not been weaned.Back in , Boris Johnson called the practice barbaric and agreed with campaigners saying farm animals should be slaughtered in this country and then exported – “on the hook, not on the hoof”.Itaposs a view backed by many in his party, The Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation tweeting this week: “Ban this miserable trade”. Few people, Conservative or otherwise, would disagreed. But instead of action we’ve had preication. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the Government was committed to ending the practice and is swinging into inaction by saying it will be “launching a public consultation in due course”.Worse, the Scottish Government is actively opposing a judicial review launched by Compassion in World Farming, which argues that journeys for calves of over eight hours with no food or water breaks are unlawful.“The Government has hinted strongly that it wants to end this trade but has done nothing,” said CIWF’s chief policy adviser Peter Stevenson. Thereaposs been no discernible action. “The Scottish Government says it wants to consult with stakeholders and wants the judicial review to be postponed. These calves are not being fed on the trucks or unloaded into facilities where they are being fed, so the Scottish Government should not be authorising these journeys of over eight hours. Lawyers on behalf of Defra as well as the Scottish Government have filed oppositions to our case. Itaposs an utterly hypocritical situation of a Government including the Prime Minister indicating pretty strongly to the public that theyaposd like to ban live exports, yet when a court case comes along saying that the export of calves is already illegal, they formally oppose it. “I am so disappointed and angry.”A Scottish Government spokesman would not comment on the judicial review while proceedings are ongoing but said it was “committed to consulting” on the issue. So, more talk, less action. Which sums up progress in Wales on another burning animal welfare issue, Lucy’s Law. This has already come into force in England where it is now illegal for puppies to be sold by shops and anyone  who is not the breeder, dealing a hammer blow to cruel commercial breeders who hide behind closed doors.Yet Wales, which is the epicentre of the mass commercial breeding of puppies in the UK, has still not acted.Next month it will be two years since I joined a rally at the Welsh Assembly in support of urgent change, but the optimism of that day, which saw a unanimous backing for Lucy’s Law, has been followed by disappointment and delay.Lesley Grfiths, Welsh minister for the Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, said last week that she wants new regulations to come into force “as quickly as possible”, while saying there should first be consultation with “key stakeholders” including, bizarrely, children. A Welsh Government spokesman said “work on new legislation to ban the third-party sale of puppies is under way”. Conservative member of the Welsh parliament, Andrew RT Davies, has called the delay a ­travesty, tweeting: “Pull your finger out Welsh Labour Government!”  Eileen Jones runs Friends of Animals Wales, which has long been rescuing dogs that are dumped by puppy farms when they become too sick to breed. “We are totally disillusioned by a process that seems to go nowhere,” she says. “Puppy farmers are reporting that business is booming as they meet purchasers at motorway service stations and car parks. The selling price of a puppy has rocketed and this has had a massive reduction on the numbers of ex-breeding stock being handed in. Whilst at the very beginning of the lockdown there was an increase in requests for us to take in dogs, once so many members of the public started doing online searches for puppy sales advertisements and the farmers started receiving hundreds of responses many of them have said they are hanging on to the breeding dogs because demand is so high. “If Lucy’s Law had been law in Wales it would have been much harder to sell them and offenders could have been fined. “How incredibly sad that not only have many puppy purchasers faced the heartbreak and financial repercussions of buying sick pups, the poor mothers who should have gained their freedom have been retained to churn out more litters. We are also gearing ourselves up for the expected tsunami  of unwanted older puppies when ownersto work and they have a dog that causes mayhem and is distressed at being left alone.” "},{"url":null,"title":"black man called cops help","story":"NewsBlack man called cops for help then died in custody after being put in chokeholdWARNING: DISTURBING FOOTAGE The family of Sterling Higgins, , has filed a wrongful death lawsuit after he was pinned down and allegedly choked in police custody in the US state of TennesseeShareByIsolde WaltersTalia ShadwellReporter:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video shocking-footage-cops-putting-black-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news black-man-called-cops-help-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Sterling Higgins, , had called law enforcement for help, but then wound up dead in their custody. Now footage has shown how officers put him in a chokehold and stood on him in a Tennessee jail, according to a new lawsuit. Higgins died in police custody last March after he was allegedly pinned to the ground and choked for just under eight minutes and then shackled to a chair at Obion County Jail in Union City. His family say he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, and had called police saying he thought someone was following him and wanted to kill him and steal his money. All four police officers seen in the footage deny any wrongdoing.  The footage obtained by campaigners shows fresh angles of the incident in the Tennessee jail house. Higginsapos case has come to the fore again more than a year after his death after his family filed a wrongful death lawsuit, and as Black Lives Matter protests continue around the world. The protests erupted after the death of George Floyd in the state of Minneapolis. The unarmed black man died after a police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The case led to widespread global outrage, becoming a flash-point for demonstrations seeking justice over his death and wider issues of racial discrimination around the world.  The BLM protests have spread to the UK, where a focus on Britainaposs bloody slavery and colonial past has led to statues being toppled, and clashes with far-right marches. The deaths of Floyd and Higgins are among recent high profile cases involving accusations of police brutality concerning choke-holds. According to police records, Higgins dialed  from a convenience store on March , , and told officers that somebody was following him, wanted to kill him and steal his money. But instead of being assisted, Higgins was arrested for criminal trespass and - following his death in police custody - one of his jailers was promoted.  Police had instructed Higgins, who according to his family suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, to leave the shop. But when officer Robert Orsborne ed and found him still there, he was arrested. Higgins was taken to the Obion County Jail where the disturbing CCTV camera footage was filmed. The videos, captured by two cameras, show Higgins staggering into the facility and grabbing at Mary Broglin, a female corrections officer. Broglin pushes Higgins and when he pushes her back, officer Waylon Spaulding appears to tackle him to the ground. Spaulding then appears to hold Higgins by the throat as Orsborne stands by. At one point, Orsborne appears to stand on top of Higgins’s body.  Footage from a camera at the other side of the facility shows Higgins’ legs flailing before becoming limp. Another jailer fetches restraints to bind Higgins. The video clips were submitted in a wrongful death lawsuit filed in federal district court in Tennessee by Higginsapos family. The lawsuit alleges that Higgins was pinned to the ground and held by the throat for just under eight minutes. All of the defendants have denied any wrongdoing. In a handwritten statement, Spaulding said that Higgins had tried to spit at him, so “I… put my hand under inmate Higgins’s chin in an attempt to keep him from spitting on any other officers.”  Orsborne told investigators that he put a foot on Higgins’s leg and then stood on the leg shackles to restrain him. The video appears to show officers dragging Higgins into a chair at .am and spending just under five minutes chaining him to the chair. Throughout, Higgins appears completely unresponsive. At .am, a jailer appears to check Higgins’s pulse. Orsborne also checks Higgins’s pulse and calls for medical assistance.  Four medics arrive at the jail fteen minutes later and Higgins is laid on the hallway floor as they attempt to resuscitate him. At .am, he is wheeled out of Obion County Jail on a stretcher and taken to a local hospital where he is declared dead at .am - just over an hour after he arrived at the jail. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation determined that none of the officers involved were responsible for Higgins’ death. An autopsy declared his cause of death as excited delirium due to a methamphetamine overdose. However, the autopsy also noted that Higgins had suffered multiple blunt force injuries including damage to his head, neck and torso. None of the officers in the video were placed on administrative leave.  Orsborne was reassigned to school resource officer at Union City Middle School last August. He told a local radio station that he was thrilled with the new role and looked forward to being a “mentor. He said: “It’s a chance to influence kids, a chance to be a mentor. “I’ll be an authority figure, but, hopefully, one the kids feel like they can trust and come to with whatever issues they might have.”  Spaulding was promoted in December , eight months after Higgins’s death, from jailer to deputy. The videos were released after three community activists submitted two Freedom Of Information requests when they became suspicious of the circumstances surrounding Higgins’ death. Bobby Gordon, , Amber Freeman, , and Joshua Freeman, , said that they only received the video in October after multiple delays. Joshua said: “When we heard about Higgins dying at the county jail, it immediately didn’t sit right, so we started asking questions.”  Bobby added that the medical report stating that an officer lay across Higgins’s body raised his suspicions. He said: “We immediately knew something was wrong and when we read the initial report that confirmed our feelings. “Something’s not right there - you don’t just lay across a man and he dies.” Amber believed the video shows a murder. She said: “I see a black murder. “The video doesn’t have any audio but they had to have known that Higgins was fighting for his le.

The hamlet is a maze of narrow cobblestone streets, bell towers and ornate churches with a stunning panorama of the valley below. The small family-run bakeries and cafés hint at a pace of le quite apart from the island’s frenetic capital, Palermo. Corleone’s name will no doubt be familiar to those who have seen it depicted on the silver screen. Fewer, though, will be aware of its real-le connections to the mob and its struggle against organised crime. The sleepy town is the birthplace of some of Cosa Nostra’s most ruthless bosses whose fanatical commitment to violence set Sicily on a collision course with authorities in Rome over  years ago.  It is perhaps unsurprising that Corleone’s association with violence angers many residents who have fought hard to shake off its grisly reputation.  Few are inclined to celebrate its mafia connections which go back well over a century. Townspeople deeply resent the mafioso culture and blame it for systemic corruption and unemployment which has blighted the region for decades.   Local activist Linda Vetrano, who does walking tours with an anti-mafia organisation, says some businesses try to exploit the stereotype of Godfatheraposs brand, adding that she “hates” its horric legacy. “What we try to do itaposs completely the opposite: we try to show the real face of the mafia and take away the romantic side”, she tells the Mirror.  A crackdown on Mafia activity in the s resulted in a wave of tit-for-tat assassinations orchestrated by Riina both in Sicily and on the mainland. In May , the country was united in horror after the murder of Sicilyaposs chief anti-mafia prosecutor Giovanni Falcone. He and his we were killed when kg of explosives were detonated as their motorcade passed on a highway just outside Palermo. Weeks later, Falcone’s childhood friend and fellow magistrate Paolo Borsellino, was killed in an explosion as he made a weekly visit to his mother’s home under armed guard. The pair had been responsible for numerous atrocities across the region for decades, but these two outrages against the state were the final straw. They were eventually handed down multiple le sentences for murder - but both showed little regret for their reign of terror.Riina was -years-old when he died peacefully from natural causes in   - but his lack of remorse saw him denied a church funeral by the local catholic clergy. “I can understand the suffering of Riina’s family with this loss. But he was the head of the mafia and no sign of redemption ever came from him,” said Don Luca Leone Provenzano, whose low-key appearance and behaviour earned him the nickname The Accountant, eventually took the reins after Riina’s arrest in the mid-s, eluding capture until . He too recently died behind bars after attempting to evade justice for decades.

His research revealed more than a dozen subterranean maritime facilities which the dictatorship can use to repair and refuel warships, as well as launch attacks, in safety and secrecy. The bases – one of which is less than a mile from a private Kim Jong-un residence – also offer a place to shelter from enemies, but Mr Bogle claims they have a crucial flaw.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.     “Kim Jong-un has invested huge sums of money in modernising the country’s conventional forces and related facilities,” he said. “Improvements to their naval assets have already been seen across the country. “But all underground facilities have one giant weakness: their entrances. Destroy those and whatever is inside becomes useless.” Given North Korea’s attempts to develop submarine-launched nuclear missiles, the signicance of these bases could be enormouswar broke out, Mr Bogle said.“Unlike the US or UK, which only have a few submarine-related bases – none of them underground – the fact that North Korea has so many creates added challenges for any preemptive strike,” he said. “It would require a near simultaneous attack on all of the bases to confidently knock out their submarine capability. “Otherwise some vessels may escape and go on to threaten any adversarial forces in the area. “Additionally, North Korea intends to build a submarine fleet capable of firing nuclear weapons – submarine-launched ballistic missiles . “Knowing where those submarines are housed prior to any future attack would be paramount.” In images collected by Mr Bogle, several navy bases can be seen to have waterways leading from the sea and into tunnels. While the exact scale of the tunnels is unknowable, some of them appear to have two access points, allowing us to draw a line between the exit and entrance to reveal the tunnel’s potential size. “One cannot tell by looking at commercial satellite imagery how complicated their interiors are,” said Jacob.“Do they have multiple side channels and galleries, for example  “But it is likely that at least some of the larger bases contain more than a single, narrow tunnelway within its respective mountain.” It’s also possible that another submarine base at Changjon, close to the South Korean border, could be brought back into action. It was closed during a period of co-operation between North and South, but now the two are at odds again, with Kim Jong-un blowing up a shared building in the border town of Kaesong on Tuesday.“As relations have deteriorated, that baseaposs strategic and propaganda value has grown,” said Jacob. “North Korea has destroyed the liaison office in Kaesong and committed to moving their military back into these demilitarised areas. “So there is a chance that the underground submarine base at Changjon could see reactivation sooner than expected.” Mr Bogle, who has created a comprehensive map of North Korea from satellite images, said the bases “were constructed several decades ago”.  “We know that they at least meet the level of sophistication found in other similar bases around the world during the s and s,” he said. “And imagery suggests that some entrances may have blast doors for defence as well as a system of devices to detect the presence of enemy submarines trying to infiltrate the base harbour.” North Korean submarines are outdated, Mr Bogle added, but he believes they remain a real danger to neighbouring countries. “North Korean submarines certainly are not a direct threat to the US,” he said.

That’s invaluable.”Irvine and Mackay work closely together at Dundee – but it’s not the first time they have worked together.Dee first team coach, Mackay, was brought to St Johnstone by Derek McInnes while Irvine was the Perth side’s first choice right back.In the end, Mackay went on to be come a club legend at McDiarmid, while Irvine moved on to Dundee.But there are no hard feelings from Irvine, who has loved every minute of his time at Dens Park.He said: “Dave Mackay came in from Livingston in [St Johnstone’s] first season in the SPL to add competition for places.

The football was great.

The proposed finishing materials are neutral in nature and similar to those at the adjacent Starbucks site.#It is therefore considered that the proposed development is in keeping with the character of the surrounding area.“The site would be largely screened from the east and south by the existing landscape buffer adjacent to the A. As such the proposed development would not adversely impact any neighbouring amenity.”The document concluded that councillors should approve the development and said it would negatively impact the availability of employment land in Aberdeenshire.It said: “The planning service consider that a robust justication and marketing information has been provided by the applicant and the approval of this application will not jeopardise the availability of employment land within the SGA or the wider Aberdeenshire region due to its small scale.“As such, it is considered that there are material considerations which support this application and it is therefore recommended for approval.”The original design statement for the project said the developer was keen to attract to mix of businesses to the site.A document prepared by Ryder LLP on behalf of  South Fornet Estates said they were trying to market the remainder of the business park.It said: “Our client continues to proactively market the remainder of the business park, comprising sites B, B and C for employment uses associated with office and warehouse development.“Market conditions within the north-east remain dficult, resulting from the recent downturn experienced with the oil and gas industry.“Our client is however keen to ersy the offering at Westpark to stimulate greater market interest as well as supplement the existing business and commercial uses established within the park through the provision of an additional retail cafe unit.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

It was placed perfectly and was the middle Reds# goal in a - Pittodrie thrashing of the Steelmen.Take a look:I can’t recall scoring a better one,” said Christie.“I scored a very good goal against Aberdeen for Inverness.“That had been my favourite goal, but this one trumps that.“I was very pleased with it.“The ball sat up nicely and I made a great connection.#Win a   Aberdeen kids kit and £ Smyths voucher in our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal competition\" title\"#Win a   Aberdeen kids kit and £ Smyths voucher in our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal competition# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp sport football aberdeen-fc donsnews help-us-find-the-best-strike-ever-from-a-dandy-don embed # secretRnUWwvGRx\" data-secret\"RnUWwvGRx\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"We want youngsters to have a go at imitating our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal contenders, with the club agreeing to give away a kids# home kit and kids# away kit for the two best efforts as chosen by our  of judges.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

similar rules regarding face masks and public transport have not been implemented across Scotland, Walesand Northern Ireland.But which types of face coverings are acceptable, and how do you wear them properly How do I wear a face mask properly The UK Government has advised that scarves, or homemade cotton coverings, that cover the nose and mouth are fine to wear- so, too, arebought masks that are not the same as those used by the health service.Surgical masks should be kept for use by health professionals.Officials have said that people can make a face covering at home, but added it is key to ensure it covers your nose and mouth.Government guidancestates that a cloth face covering should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably. This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly. The covering can be washed with other laundry, using your normal detergent.When wearing a face covering, take care to tuck away any loose ends.How do I stop my glasses from steaming up If you wear glasses, wearing a face mask at the same time can cause the lenses to steam up, making it dficult to see properly.But the common problem has an easy solution, thanks to advice from doctors in the medical journal Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.To prevent the issue, doctors advise washing your glasses with soapy water before putting the mask on, and rinsing them under warm water.Then, gently dry off the lenses with a clean towel or cloth before putting them back on.Washing the lenses with soapy water leaves behind a ldquothin surfactant film that reduces misting on the lenses, meaning they now shouldnrsquot steam up when a face mask is worn.Should face coverings be worn where The current government advice states that face coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces, which includes some shops and public transport.At the moment, people are not being told to wear them outdoors, while exercising, or in schools or offices.Several airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair, have introduced a requirement for passengers to wear face masks on board.However, the government believes that face masks should be reserved for people who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-priest-moving-rome-new-job","story":"A BORDERS priest has accepted a high-ranking job in Rome.Nick Welsh, , has been based in Galashiels for the past two years.But he will soon be flying out to Italy after being picked for the role of vice-rector at the Scots College, where aspiring Scottish priests receive their training.Father Nick, originally from Stirling, told the Border he had ldquomixed emotions when he heard the news.He said: ldquoIrsquom quite excited, but Irsquoll have a bit of a heavy heart when I leave ndash I was just getting used to the Borders.Since , Father Nick has been administrator of the Parish of Our Lady  St Andrew, which has churches in Galashiels, Melrose and Selkirk.He said: ldquoI was really warmly welcomed here.

What a shame, then, about the second thing I couldnrsquot help noticing: how drab and disappointing George Square remains.Granted, the grim sight of loyalist protesters wrapped in Union flags ldquoprotecting the statues and Cenotaph didnrsquot help. But even without their isive presence the cityrsquos historic square is a let-down, visually, socially and culturally, a frustrating waste of urban space that could and should be far better utilised.Where other European squares create buzz and atmosphere with year-round arts, culture, food and shopping attracting locals and visitors, George Square is dreary and uninspiring: a few trees, some benches and a clutch of dull, predictable th-century statues ndash ldquogreat men and Queen Victoria ndash that few feel any kinship with. The only part of the square that has any real purpose and meaning is the Cenotaph.The idea that George Square is in serious need of a makeover is nothing new, of course, and there have been ious  dawns and broken promises over the years, not least the outrageous fiasco of  ndash remember that  ndash which wasted huge amounts of public money and goodwill alike. But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course. But surely we can find new and more creative ways to confront, commemorate and celebrate it, taking in voices that were previously ignored ndash women, ethnic minorities, working class people, gay people, the disabled ndash reflecting the ersity of our city as it is now.Rather than an expensive international competition for designs ndash letrsquos learn from  ndash a three-month public consultation could be held, and a  of local architects, planners, artists, businesspeople and community groups convened to create perhaps three dferent plans, which would then be voted on by the people of Glasgow. Granted, such an ambitious revamp wouldnrsquot be easy to fund in the dficult years ahead, but with a crucial economic and culturalat stake, it should be prioritised. Surely a mixture of public, private and philanthropic funding could be sourced Glasgow City Council has already started the conversation that could make all this happen, by bringing forward the pedestrianisation of George Square and suspending a third of city centre parking bays to make room for walkers and cyclists.I would urge council leader Susan Aitken and her team to think bigger. A commitment to redesign George Square would offer an exciting, positive and inclusive focus for Glaswegians in the tough months ahead. The end result could be what Glasgow has been crying out for for a generation: a proud and modern civic centrepiece that is worthy of our great city, a place that excites, entertains, and educates, that makes us feel part of something bigger.

If at any point, say with the ldquoScottish Covenant in  , they had attempted to seriously meet Scottish democratic aspirations, then Mr Bone would be sleeping more happily in his bed.Now itrsquos probably too late many Scots no longer trust Unionists donrsquot believe in a Prime Minister who has repeatedly made disparaging remarks about Scots and Scotland find majority Scottish opinions commonly discounted and ignored.GR Weir, Ochiltree.NO doubt there will be many comments about David Bonersquos letter about the SNP supposedly engineering ldquoisive identity politics\". I would argue that the Establishment in England, especially in Whitehall, has been doing that since the birth of the United Kingdom.As a schoolboy in  I asked why the new queen was titled Queen Elizabeth the Second of Great Britain. The answer was that she accepted that proposal when made in Whitehall. Thirty-four years later a British team first won the European Cup. Jock Stein was only given a lowly honour because of classdistinction by Whitehall directive.How often does radio and television media refer to Manchester being in the North although these media supposedly relate to the whole of the British Isles  Even in quizzes, questions such as \"how many lions are on the Royal Standard\" or \"which organisation is responsible for lighthouses and navigation aids\" have only the answers referring to England accepted  Newspaper reviews almost never include those of The Herald or other Scottish papers.The current issue of the History Scotland magazine relates atthe dficulties in forming international rules, for both rugby and football, for the home nations. For several years the English administrators wanted the other nations to accept only those of England. Even the first Scottish rugby team to play against England was picked in England.The question of more anger in the last decade and months arises from Brexit, Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. These have virtually ignored the Scottish majority.Hate is too strong a word, butit does occur then it should be directed at the arrogance of the English establishment and Whitehall, not at our neighbouring nations as a whole. I am sure that many Scots have English friends and relations with whom we continue to socialise ndash providing that we get to air our own views.JB Drummond, Kilmarnock.THE SNPrsquos call for more funding from Westminster is baffling.Coming from the administration whose financial \"expertisersquorsquo has led to two rusting hulks on a Scottish shipyardrsquos stocks, at the cost of hundreds of millions, and, with exquisite timing for a pandemic, a white elephant airport.

It seems invidious to talk of them as a universally frail category perhaps they are better described as having reached a point when there is much less road ahead than in the rear view mirror. Yet, regardless of physical condition, by this stage spiritual sustenance and solace become more pressing and meaningful. Equally comforting is the companionship and consolation of a like-minded community.Brought up as I was in a devout Church of Scotland family, I saw the importance for older members of the routine, ritual and contact weekly services offered. Remembering some of our church-going friends, people of inspiring kindness and integrity, it is deeply upsetting to think that it is iniduals like them, to whom the church owes its very existence, who are being sidelined and devalued. The idea of banishing the elderly, of consigning them to a Zoom link or a virtual coffee morning until the virus has fled, is cruel. Therersquos no other word for it.

For months, the -plus have been living in near isolation and confinement, bombarded with terrying news and statistics, and unable to see family or friends. Imprisoned as they have been at home, for them the church represents a calm, still centre during the storm. Many will have been longing to get back into their place of worship, but will now be worried they are not entirely welcome. It doesnrsquot get much more hurtful than that.As well as being harsh, the Kirkrsquos attitude is also short-sighted. Dwindling as its resources are, it relies heavily on bequests. For some parishioners, as they approach old age it is important to know they will continue to contribute to the Church of Scotlandrsquos work, long after they have gone.

The ship will be multi-al, carbon-free and, the team believe, is set to become an important social and historical landmark for Glasgow and Scotland.Now, in the latest development of the -year campaign that has seen the boat threatened with dismantling and dashing the hopes of campaigners who had planned to see her back in her birthplace last year, FOCI have secured the backing of a major company who will help modernise the ship.The ABB Marine  Ports will lead the main development of the ship as, making use of modern technology, as they take it from disrepair to a fully-al sailing ship through the design and implementation of the engine and propulsion system ndash and bringing the dream of ing the -year-old vessel to her homeland ever closer.Tim Munn, sales manager at ABB, explains ldquoABB Marine  Ports is delighted to be working with Falls of Clyde International in order to design and supply a power and propulsion system for the Falls of Clyde vessel.ldquoABB Marine  Ports, Falls of Clyde international and partners will collaborate on innovative solutions in order to make the Falls of Clyde a showcase for what can be done with modern technology on historic vessels.Plans include the addition of battery storage, wind turbines, and hybrid power as well as the reinstatement of her signicant sail power.Hopes for the Falls of Clydersquos future voyages will be a far cry from her former le as a workhorse that saw her transporting cargo such as lumber, jute, cement, and wheat from ports in Australia, Calornia, India, New Zealand, and the UK.In , Falls of Clyde was bought by Captain William Matson, a Swedish-born American shipping executive and the founder of Matson Navigation Company, taken to Honolulu, and registered under the Hawaiian flag.After a considerable redesign, she made voyages that saw her carrying oil, sugar, cargo and passengers between Hawaii and Calornia.She soon developed a reputation as a hardy, fast, and reliable vessel.:Opinion, Alison Rowat: Too many are suffering, time to get back in business, ScotlandDesignated a US National Historic Landmark in , the Falls of Clyde is crumbling in harbour, neglect showing on her hull, deck and masts.In  The Bishop Museum, former owners of the vessel, announced plans to sink her, before FOCI stepped in.But the latest development in the tale of repatriating the Scottish ship could signal her new le could now be imminent, after many years of uncertainty.David OrsquoNeill, founder and director of the project, said: ldquoFOCI welcomes the positive approach received recently from the offshore renewables sector in Europe to play a substantial part in helping us to put out a request to global players to help design, build and install an emission free-storage and propulsion system for the former sail-powered oil tanker."},{"url":null,"title":"archaeologists-working-edinburgh-tram-project","story":"Archaeologists started excavating the area last November as part of plans to add . miles to the tram line, connecting Leith and Newhaven to the current end of the Edinburgh tram line at York Place.And, as construction started again on Monday following the lockdown, the city council revealed their findings from earlier this year.:Coronavirus: Social care workers twice as likely to die from Covid as colleagues on NHS frontlineThey said the historic artefacts unearthed around Constitution Street had been investigated by archaeologists and shed new light on the areas history.A small iron cannonball was uncovered and is believed to date back to the th century - a type used around the time of the Civil War when Leith was refortied.Archaeologists also found the heavily truncated remains of a large stone wall running east to west under the junction of Bernard Street and Constitution Street. They believe it may be part of the seawall for the th and th century town fortications and a spokeswoman said they would be investigating it further once the project is fully operational again.Ancient whale bones were also found on Constitution Street near its junction with Baltic Street. Experts believe they are a matching radius and ulnaof a large adult male sperm whale.The bones have yet to be carbon dated - due to Covid- delays - which they hope will help explain how they ended up under the pavement in Leith.Among possible theories are that they were brought back in the th or th century as a memento as part of Leithrsquos historic whaling industry or that they came from the remains of a whale beached locally and were later dumped there.They may also have been part of medieval deposits left during the reclamation of the site in the th to th centuries.The team, from Guard Archaeology Ltd, also excavated an area between Bernard Street and Tower Street and said it revealed important evidence relating to the reclamation of the area. They uncovered a large system of th century interlinked brick and stone box-drains, th century walls and a possible slipway. They said evidence of th century clay pipes also indicated that the reclamation of the foreshore - when land was extended into the Forth - could have occurred earlier than first thought.Archaeologist John Lawson said finding the whale bones was particularly fascinating and exciting.\"These bones provide a rare glimpse into and also a physical link with Leithrsquos whaling past, one of its lesser known maritime industries and one which in the th century reached as far as the Antarctic,\" he said.\"Given the circumstances of how they were found it is possible that they may date back to the medieval period, andso would be a rare and exciting archaeological discovery in Edinburgh.He said all of the finds offered an interesting glimpse into the areas history over the past  years and they would now work to conserve them.Council leader Adam McVey said the new discoveries continued to shed light on the areas fascinating and ied history.ldquoIrsquom pleased that the team will now be able to resume their work as part of the project, which is vital to conserving the arearsquos past, and look forward to finding out even more as they progress,\" he added.Deputy leader Cammy Day said the trams to Newhaven project was crucial to the long term development of the city and would deliver much needed housing, jobs and investment for the future.:Opinion, Alison Rowat: Too many are suffering, time to get back in business, Scotland\"As part of its delivery, itrsquos fitting that we also learn more about Leithrsquos past, as these remarkable findings are helping us to do,\" he said.During the first phase of the archaeological work last year, the team took down part of a wall surrounding Constitution Street graveyard, dating back to , ahead of excavation of the historic graveyard thought to be underneath Constitution Street and the South Leith Parish Church wall.They discovered what appeared to be a large charnel pit which may contain the remains of some burials recovered from the laying of th century services in Constitution Street.

Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely and provide advice,requested, on applying and removing the covering.On ferry services face coverings must also be worn by passengers and staff unless the ferry, or part of the ferry which is open to members of the public, is entirely outdoors or physical distancing of two metres can be maintained.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson stressed the importance of the new rules and that by wearing a face covering everyone is engaged in a collective responsibility to reduce the risk of transmission.He said: “Our message remains clear that public transport should be for key workers and those who need it most and can’t walk or cycle to work.#Capacity is reduced to enable physical distancing and operators are not yet running full services. However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens. These measures complement physical distancing and good hand hygiene, they do not replace them.”Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website. This advice is being updated to include full details of the applicable exemptions.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them. The furlough scheme has helped us to do that.” vw, px\"  Planning, forward thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China.Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had.“The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown.“Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base.Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes.Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank.“That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.”Shnuggle also received a £, Small Business Grant.Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy.“So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving.” vw, px\"  Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.

You should remove the caddies inside # and the items for collection should be included in your single green bin or box as we will be unable to pick up more than one at a time.Grey bincollections for household waste will continue on a fortnightly basis – again on your usual collection day.This means that the council will collect:• Glass # week commencing June .• Plastic # bottles week commencing June .• Metals and tins # week commencing July .• Paper card # week commencing July .Councillor Drever added: “We want to thank households for their cooperation and patience whilst we continue to clear the backlog of recyclables that folk have been storing during the pandemic.”Just a reminder that paper and card is being collected this week . This should be contained in a single green bin or box.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

The updated shielding guidance applies until June  and Dr McBride has said further guidance will be provided before the end of the month.Officials are facing calls to provide clarity to people who are shielding, particularly amid reports that some people are coming under pressure toto work, while concerns have also been raised by younger people who are shielding about the effects the protection measures are having on their children.DUP MLA Alex Easton, a member of the Stormont health committee, said any further letters advising people to shield must include more information for patients and employers.I would like more clarity around shielding in general, he said. My father, who is diabetic and has lost both legs as a result, didn#t receive a letter, so I think that the letters need to include a lot more information.I would like to see the letters include a booklet with a list of conditions and medication that mean patients should shield. There should also be specic information for employers because I have been contacted by people who have been told to shield and they are being expected to work.I think the majority of employers have been very understanding, but the longer this goes on, the more challenging it is going to be for those who are shielding. The next letter should include detailed information for employers about why it is so important that anyone who is shielding should take the precautions that is being sent out by the CMO.People who have been deemed as falling to the highest clinical risk group, and have therefore been told to shield, include anyone who has had an organ transplant, cancer patients, people with motor neurone disease and anyone with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.In the letters being sent out to people this week, Dr McBride explained: I know that this has been a very challenging time for you and that it will not always have been easy to comply with the advice. The Covid- virus still poses a high risksomeone who is shielding is exposed to it. However, infection levels in the community are now falling so the risk of exposure is signicantly less than it has been over the last two months.Because the risk is lower, I have now updated the guidance for Northern Ireland so that from June  those who are shielding can now spend time outside with people from their own household or one person from another household whilst ensuring that social distancing is observed. I know that you will want to know about our plans for the future of the shielding advice. Please be assured that we are actively reviewing the shielding advice and we will provide new guidance before the end of the first shielding period.Dr McBride is also asking anyone who is shielding to take part in an engagement process which will help advise government policy on shielding in the months ahead.He added: Finally, I wanted to thank you for all of your efforts during this very dficult time. The Covid- pandemic has made huge demands on many people across Northern Ireland, and I want you to know that we understand the uncertainty and upheaval that those shielding, their families and carers in particular have faced.Belfast Most ReadClarity call as medical chief issues letters to NI shieldersCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingCoronavirus: MLA Bradshaw says reason for small cluster outbreak in NI #should be made public#It#s not just Linfield who have made people shirty or hot under the collar... here are some other strips that have courted controversyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Free parking to end and bus lane enforcement resumes as one further death recorded,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mark Hamiliton, who is a member of Ash, and his dad, Neil, started the project a year ago and since then the customised bangles have been snapped up by fans. The father and son team have now raised £, for the charity, which has had to suspend many of its services for local cancer patients and their families, and has furloughed most staff due to the coronavirus pandemic.The charity has also had to postpone its fundraising events, so donations are even more vital during the current crisis. The latest batch of bracelets are from guitar and bass strings played during Ash#s recent European tour, which was cancelled half-way through. Over the last year, Mark#s dad has made hundreds of bangles as souvenirs from a host of the band#s concerts played all over the world. Mark, who said he hopes to be back on tour once the pandemic is over, said: Thanks so much to all the Ash and Snow Patrol fans who have supported our #RockBangle project for Cancer Focus NI. So far we have raised around £, and hope to sell more bracelets once our tour recommences, whenever that may be. Big gratitude also to dad, who#s worked so hard on making these bangles in his wee shed, and Happy Father#s Day to him from my lockdown home in Northumberland.Mark donated the proceeds of the bracelets to Cancer Focus NI because of his mum, Miriam, who has now thankfully survived cancer three times. Miriam has received great support from Cancer Focus NI over the years. She is also one of the founder members of the charity#s support group in Downpatrick, helping other women who#ve been diagnosed with cancer. Mark, who sells the bangles on his social media channels, explained that making the bracelets is a team effort. I weave and cut the strings to size and my dad solders the joints together, making what was an ugly joint into something that resembles a metal pearl, he explained. They look nice, but raw and rustic. I want them to retain a bit of that rock #n# roll aesthetic. Rosie Forsythe, from Cancer Focus NI, said: We can#t thank Mark and his dad enough for all their hard work and generosity. Cancer Focus NI relies on donations for over % of our income.

celebrates with Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonaldand vice president Michelle O’Neill after his general election victory Mark EdwardsTwitterEmailJune   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSinn Fein heavily outspent their political rivals in last year#s general election, new figures have revealed.The Electoral Commission has published the campaign spending s of political parties that contested the  UK Parliamentary general election in Northern Ireland.The  political parties reported spending a combined total of £, between December   until polling day on December  . Sinn Fein spent £, during this period, with the Conservatives spending the second highest amount locally with £,.The Alliance Party spent £,, SDLP £, and the DUP spent considerably less than their political rivals Sinn Fein, with only £, spent.Aontu spent £, People Before Profit Alliance spent £ and the Green Party spent just £ during this period.The DUP suffered a bruising general election, losing two MPs in Nigel Doddsand Emma Little-Pengelly . Mr Dodds lost his seat to Sinn Fein#s John Finucane while Little-Pengelly was defeated by the SDLP#s Claire Hanna. The general election saw Nationalist MPs outnumber unionists at Westminster for the first time. The DUP took eight seats, with Sinn Fein taking seven, the SDLP two and the Alliance Party one. Boris Johnson had called a snap election last year in a bid to win a majority and force his Brexit deal through parliament. The gamble paid off, with Johnson securing a comfortable majority in parliament, enabling him to get his Brexit deal passed by MPs.Pro-Remain parties in Northern Ireland formed election pacts in order to boost the chances of pro-Remain MPs being ed to Westminster. Sinn Fein did not run any candidates in South Belfast in a bid to help Ms Hanna get elected, while the SDLP reciprocated in North Belfast to aid Mr Finucane election chances. The Green Party did not stand any candidates, explaining why the party only spent £ during the election campaign.Cahir Hughes, Head of Electoral Commission Northern Ireland, said: “This is the first publication of spending information relating to last year’s general election, an important part of the transparency which is essential to our democratic process. It is vital that voters are able to see clearly and accurately how money is spent on influencing them at elections.“For future elections, we have recommended that the law be changed so that parties and campaigners have to provide voters with more detail about how they spend their money at elections. This sits alongside other recommended changes to improve transparency and to address public concerns about who has produced and paid for the political campaign material they see online.”Belfast Most ReadClarity call as medical chief issues letters to NI shieldersCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingIt#s not just Linfield who have made people shirty or hot under the collar... here are some other strips that have courted controversyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Free parking to end and bus lane enforcement resumes as one further death recordedCoronavirus: MLA Bradshaw says reason for small cluster outbreak in NI #should be made public#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Obviously many people will be nervous, butyou can spend, do - it might save a job or two. Most of Northern Ireland#s often-criticised large public sector still have employment, as do others in IT, agriculture, etc, he said.So the advice is not to be reckless, but economies only grow and jobs are saved by spending. Soyou can, do. Maybe then we can keep less people on furlough from ending up unemployed.Speaking at an online seminar of the Association of Chartered Certied Accountants, Mr Gibson said: It will be our responsibility as citizens and as businesses to show confidence in the sectors of our economy that need it most. This will require a collective effort to go out for a meal, to buy a coffee from our local cafe and to go to the cinema when they open.He told the Belfastthat the public understandably felt powerless in the face of large-scale redundancies, including , jobs lost between aeroplane seat maker Thompson Aero and aerospace giant Bombardier. But he added: We can#t go out and buy aeroplane seats or wings, but what we can do is make those little decisions to support those restaurants, shops and cafes that might close without our support.The money you hand over to that person on the other side of the till could make the dference to whether or not that person still has that job in the future.He added putting up with queues in order to support businesses was the right thing to do. Maybe you look at the coffee shop or ice-cream shop and think you can#t be bothered queuing, he said. But that decision could be a dference between that coffee shop staying open or not. It sounds dramatic, but it#s true.Belfast Most ReadClarity call as medical chief issues letters to NI shieldersCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingCoronavirus: MLA Bradshaw says reason for small cluster outbreak in NI #should be made public#It#s not just Linfield who have made people shirty or hot under the collar... here are some other strips that have courted controversyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Free parking to end and bus lane enforcement resumes as one further death recorded,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"watch childs play as mp claire hanna given surprise during meeting","story":"SDLP MP Claire Hanna was left red-faced Wednesday morning after being interrupted during a virtual Westminster Committee meeting... by someone much younger than any elected representative.During a call with members of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, Northern Ireland Office minister Robin Walker and committee chairman Simon Hoare, Ms Hanna was attempting to ask a question relating to the government#s fiscal powers when her young daughter casually appeared at the bottom of the screen.Not to be deterred, the SDLP rep managed to ask her question while wrangling with the youngster, while at the same time conceding: Apologies, I have a young visitor, to which Simon Hoare cheerfully greeted, Good morning, young Hanna!The discussion briefly paused while Ms Hanna ushered her visitor out of the room, commenting: I should keep some sweets in this room as a bribe.Robin Walker admitted his daughter too had attempted to join a few of his work calls in recent weeks, while Mr Hoare said: I had my terrier join in on a call, which was quite interesting, and that#s not a euphemism for anything .Belfast Most ReadClarity call as medical chief issues letters to NI shieldersCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingIt#s not just Linfield who have made people shirty or hot under the collar... here are some other strips that have courted controversyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Free parking to end and bus lane enforcement resumes as one further death recordedCoronavirus: MLA Bradshaw says reason for small cluster outbreak in NI #should be made public#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic ‘hit awfully hard’. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use outdoor space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise and have a few extra drinks. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic ‘hit awfully hard’. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use outdoor space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise and have a few extra drinks. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, googletag.cmd.push Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. googletag.cmd.push “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”  CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said: “The newly created footway will make it much safer for all road and footway users including school children attending the local schools, pedestrians and motorists alike. googletag.cmd.push “With the popularity of cycling ever increasing the widening of the footway to include cycle-paths are a much-welcomed addition. “The junction of the Ford Road has been greatly improved with the removal of high verges at the entrance greatly improving visibility for those entering and exiting this junction. “I wish to thank Tracy Bratton DFI Roads Service and FP Mc Cann contractors for their cooperation in having this signicant road safety project delivered. The residents of Clady and surrounding area are very appreciative of these improvements, completed to a high standard that improves safety for motorists, walkers and cyclists alike.” Work has also been completed in the nearby area of Glenone, with safety chevrons restored on the Portglenone to Bellaghy Road. googletag.cmd.push Carntogher councillor Martin Kearney welcomed the development but condemned vandalism to road signage in the area. “A number of traffic accidents here in recent times have caused considerable concern to local road users,” he said. “Previous markers had been demolished as well with vehicles often ending up in the nearby fields. I am pleased to report the Department of Infrastructure has replaced these chevrons. “However, it is disappointing to note that when the local community were abiding by the advice to lockdown others were vandalising the nearby Ballynease Rd bilingual sign which has been there for over  years. Thankfully the Council have replaced that also.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Brian Tierney, said the range of events really captured the essence of what learning is about for all ages. Looking at the wonderful and wide-ranging programme that has been put in place for this festival is extremely exciting – there really is something for everyone and I think it has been adapted really well to fit in with the current climate in taking the festival online. We can all do with learning new things, whether its a new skill or education on really important issues like disability awareness or the role medicine plays in our society. This programme celebrates everyone, from our young children to our students, and the adults out there as well – its never too late to learn! Our current situation can be overwhelming and frustrating at times, and this festival offers the perfect solution, by picking up new skills and information, and by utilising technology in a way that we may never have needed before.” More details about the festival are available on the councils website.

It was the beginning for the man Stephen Kenny has put his trust into lead the scouting and analysis of the Republic of Ireland soccer team. googletag.cmd.push Higgins obsession for the game smashed through the roof when he began to play with the local Newtowne underage teams from the age of seven. “I wasnt one of those kids that was into cartoons, super heroes and Disney films, I was just obsessed by playing football from no age,” Ruaidhri begins. “I cant ever remember not playing it and it has been my le.” It began to get more serious when Kenny Shiels, who was taking his son Dean to play for Lisburn Youths at the time, asked Ruaidhris fatherhis son would join them. It was a prominent shop window for scouts, but the regular . kick-offs demanded a six oclock rise and trek up the M. googletag.cmd.push “It was a massive commitment,” Ruaidhri said, of his parents Danny and Marys time. For two years, it was Newtowne in the summer and Lisburn in the winter and all the travelling it entailed. They backed him  percent. Ruaidhri and Paddy are their youngest sons, with a  year gap to Michael and Kevin. “It is two dferent generations, but we are unbelievably close, the four of us,” Ruaidhri stresses. “I have been in every corner of Europe with football and they have always followed, they have been massive supporters in my career. “Without that upbringing and without that support, then I probably wouldnt be in the position I am in and wouldnt have had a career in this country like I had. I am very grateful and I dont take it for granted.” Ruaidhri played Gaelic football in his youth and as a pupil of St Marys Limavady lost an Ulster final replay to Coalisland. Growing up, he rarely missed a game when Derry were challenging for Sam Maguire. Even then, at the age of eight, Ruaidhri was deeper in thought than most. “The semi-final was probably the final, I remember when Johnny McGurk hit the winning score with his left foot,” Ruaidhri recalls of the  triumph, with the detail he will be using to suss out Irelands opponents. “It was a massive passion at that time but football shaded it. My brothers, my Da and my uncles first love would be GAA.” His first soccer football game was a trip to Parkhead to see Celtic come from - down to beat Dundee United in the Scottish Cup. He has been to Old Trafford, but doesnt have a favourite team. “I wouldnt say I am a fan of anyone. I am a football fan and I would look out for Celtic orUniteds score but it wouldnt ruin my weekendthey didnt win.” As the years passed, Ruaidhris prowess in the ious underage leagues attracted the attention of soccer scouts and was forward and back with too many clubs before opting for Coventry City. *** There were offers from more prominent clubs on the table, but Coventry attracted him. A chance for first team football, a long-term contract and hospitality all influenced his decision. “I was made feel unbelievably welcome, even at that age, by Gordon Strachan, the first team manager,” Ruaidhri states. “Richard Money, the Academy Director, and George Mackiemade my family feel unbelievably welcome every time we went over and made a big fuss.” Ruaidhri has no regrets about the move and completed his last two years of school in Coventry. At the time, a growth spurt led to knee problems and he spent the first two months in plaster and he didnt kick a ball for close to six months. “It was the right decision,” Ruaidhri points out of the club insisting he join earlier than anticipated. “I was playing through the pain barrier at home and they werent happy about it. Until they fixed it, I went  months in and out of playing because of the pain I was in. They had invested in me and were well within their rights. “It toughened me up. I moved away from home at  and had to become a man before a normal teenager, that stood me in good stead. Looking back, in terms of becoming more streetwise, it gave me a sound footing.” While he was happy with his progress in his first two years, he felt there was a genuine point he caught the eye of first-team manager Gary McAllister, who liked how Ruairi played in possession and he bagged two goals on his reserve debut. “I played really well and got peoples attention around the club,” Higgins felt. It was a quick evolution in how the game changed and relegation from the Championship sent out a warning message. “It was all about second balls and getting up and down the pitch. That didnt suit my style. Once athleticism started to take over from creative players, I kinda knew I might not have a career at that level,” he added. For four and half years, Coventry had high hopes for the Limavady man, but it faded away. When his contract ended, he wasnt too keen on going down the leagues. “It is a body blow to players when they get released from clubs in England. It is your dream, it is your passion, you feel you have failed.” Just when he needed a saviour, Stephen Kenny made the first of five important phone calls to Ruaidhri Higgins. *** With his teenage years coming to an end and his Coventry career over, an   number lit up on Ruaidhri Higgins phone. Kenny had just taken up the mantle as Derry City manager in August  and was putting together a squad. “I had never spoken to him before,” Ruaidhri reveals. “There was a definite rebuilding process when I came home, I wasnt the same person for six to  months. I lost my confidence and felt I had let people down,” he said, while stressing nothing was further from the truth. “Stephen was the perfect manager for me at that time. Living at home with my parents helped massively.” Slowly but surely he got his mojo back. “I owe Stephen a lot. In my first six months I played a lot in the reserve team just to get playing football again. I was performing better and better and running games in the reserves and it gave me the confidence that I could get my career back on track.” Kennys management skills continued, when he waited for the opportune moment to bed him back into the senior squad. It wasnt a rush, but rather some games to ease him into a regular spot. The Candystripes, with Higgins as a regular, won four League Cups in a row from  to . In , they won the FAI Cup with a - extra-time thriller, Kennys last game before taking over at Scottish side Dunfermline. After losing the  title to Cork City on the last day of the season, they missed the  treble after Shelbourne won the league on score dference. “Stephen brought great success and, particularly in  and , the Brandywell was packed and there was a great buzz”, Higgins states. “We had a really good run in Europe in  and that probably cost us the treble because of the backlog of games.” Derry beat IFK Gothenburg and Gretna before going out against Paris Saint-Germain - on aggregate, after holding the French side scoreless at the Brandywell in the first leg. Higgins played in both legs against Gothenburg and rates it has his European highlight. “They had three or four Swedish internationals that played in the  World Cup. We were something like - to win in Gothenburg,” he remembers. Kenny broke down their opponents in advance of the game, showing video clips of unknown teams and how they got results against Gothenburg. “I remember after that meeting, we walked out of it and we were thinking we have a helluva chance here. “We went out and deserved to win the game. It wasnt a smash and grab, it was an unbelievable performance. The home game we deserved to win that, we won - on aggregate and it was a massive achievement for the club.” Derry lost the FAI Cup final in  and were relegated to the First Division the following season, due to financial irregularities. “We went four or five months without pay. I had just bought a house, I had a mortgage and I had bills to pay,” Higgins points out. Pat Fenlon brought him to Bohemians. During the stint Bohs won the Setanta Cup, but Higgins was cup tied and missed out and again Higgins missed on a league medal on score dference to champions Shamrock Rovers. “I probably didnt do myself justice there. I had a decent period in mid-season, I lost my form and when Derry got promoted I went back there.” Back at the Brandywell, Higgins won a fth League Cup and in the FAI Cup decider, his flick on setup Rory Patterson for the extra-time winner. “We qualied for Europe through the league and were actually in the title race until four or five games in the season.” The  season, was one of Higgins best in a Derry shirt, but when Roddy Collins came in as manager, he wasnt in the plans. “I had a good season and had a new options and it was Stephenwho brought me to Dundalk and we won the League Cup, that was my sixth. It gave us the confidence to push on and win the league,” Higgins recalls. “We were trailing Cork going into the final game of the season. We played them at home and we beat them -, that was an amazing night. I was involved in four titles that went to the last game of the season, I lost three and won that one. “There has been a lot of ups and downs but thankfully there are a lot of good memories to look back on. You get lower with the downs than higher with the ups “Throughout my playing career in the League of Ireland, I averaged a trophy a season, so I had a successful enough playing career.” After a spell at Coleraine, where he also managed the U Academy squad, he began to focus more on coaching. He remembers Willie McKeown, then Coventrys Ireland scout telling him youve a great eye for the game and encouraging him to push on and get his coaching badges. “I had no interest at that time obviously. You have this dream of becoming a star footballer, but I genuinely always had an interest in the tactical side of the game,” said Higgins. Stephen Kenny also thought he had a good eye for the game and asked him to join Dundalks coaching staff. In the first season, they lost out to Cork City in the league. “I stayed in the role as analyst, we won thedouble and Stephen left to take theUs, Vinnywas promote to manager and I was promoted to assistant manager. So, I won the league with Dundalk in three dferent roles.” *** When Kenny was promoted to the Ireland manager post, he once again punched Higgins number into his phone. It was a brilliant call to get,not altogether a shock. “We have that relationship. He values me. It was a shock in a sense that it was the international stage, a dferent level. “It is a huge honour and a privilege to be asked. I had made my mind up very quickly because it is impossible to turn that opportunity down when it comes.” He acknowledges Dundalk, who he states were amazing in giving him the . Going to another League of Ireland Cup would have took some serious thinking. “When you are going to the international stage, it is incredibility tough to even consider turning that down,” Ruaidhri highlights. Now the work starts again in earnest. When I first call, he is scouring footage of European play-off opponents Bulgaria. His weeks are taken up with meetings, both online and face to face where circumstances allow it. “ One thing you can be sure, Stephen will have plenty for you to do and he leaves nothing to chance,” Ruaidhri stresses. “We have two games in early September, thats the main focus for myself, Stephen and the staff under him.” When le gets back to normal and gamesto the fixture calendar, Ruaidhri will be clocking up the air miles. “I will be going to watch our own players in England and reporting back, as well as studying the opposition,” he adds. Nothing beats being there and seeing a game in the flesh. The TV camera will only ever follow the ball. “If you have a birds eye view from the stand, you can see everything that is going on. When the ball is at this end of the pitch, what is the teams shape like back here. “When you are watching an inidual player, you literally focus on the player. It is dferentyou are watching a team. You are analysing the whole structure of the team. It is two completely dferent things,” Higgins continues. From playing on Termoncanices school team, to now, he is now an important cog in international football and takes Stephens approach as a massive compliment. “There are a lot of bigger names than me, who he couldve went after and have loved the position. He has huge trust in me and sees the value I can bring and I take it as a massive compliment and for me, it is a huge confidence booster.” He has never been at a major tournament as a fan. Watching from a pub as Damien Duff tore Spain apart in the  World Cup clash in Suwon is a memory, a game Ireland lost on penalties. “Damien was probably the best winger in the world and thats not exaggerating,” Higgins says of the man who, along with Alan Kelly and Keith Andrews, is now in the management setup with him. Now, qualying for a major tournament would be a dream, but as part of the management is also an objective Higgins has an input to. “We have an opportunity within the next two years of getting to the Euros and getting to a World Cup. “You dream of it when you were a small boy. We will be doing everything we can, it wont be from the want of trying. We have a really good group of players to go and try to achieve something special.” Football has always been Ruaidhri Higgins le. His skill set has opened the latest door of opportunity.

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

However, all facilities will close at pm.Within the next two weeks, additional council toilet facilities will reopen at three locations in Newcastle mdash Castle Park, Central Promenade and South Promenade, with council-owned toilets at Spelga Dam also set to reopen.The council says it is reopening toilet blocks between am and pm as part of a ldquophased approach balancing service provision, resources and the health and safety of the public and local authority staff.The organisation says that reopening public toilets will increase the districtrsquos tourist offering, confirming that work is underway to open additional toilet blocks on a phased basis with the hope to have as many as possible open at the height of the summer.But a warning has been issued that the reopening plan depends upon available resources to ensure that all facilities are serviced to the standard required.ldquoIt is vital to provide facilities that are maintained to a level that mitigates the risk of cross-contamination and possible transfer of Covid- among members of the public, said a council spokesman.Council officials say the measures taken to reopen public conveniences include increased frequency of cleansing and inspection, social distancing and hand washing signage and hand sanitisers provided outside each facility.In addition, the local authority says that its plan to reopen all public conveniences across the district will be continually reviewed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Removal of statue is ‘ridiculous’  ","story":"CALLS for the removal of a statue in west London in honour of one of Killyleaghrsquos most famous sons have been branded ldquoridiculous by a local politician.The statue of Sir Hans Sloane is included on a list of monuments that should be removed over his perceived links to slavery.Activists from the Black Lives Matter movement want the statue in honour of Sir Hans removed, while a campaign has been launched to replace it with a tribute to former Cha footballers Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Eidur Gudjohnsen.It is Sloanersquos marriage to Elizabeth Rose mdash the daughter of a wealthy slave planter in Jamaica ndash bringing him a one-third share of the net profits from her fatherrsquos vast plantations, which has put him on the list of Black Lives Matters campaigners.In addition, campaigners want to rename streets named after Sir Hans in the highly fashionable Knightsbridge area such as Sloan Square because he derived part of his wealth from his slave owner father-in-law who owned plantations in Jamaica.The collections of Sir Hans Sloane helped found the first museum in the world - the British Museum - and he was personal physician to three dferent English monarchs. He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town. Killyleagh is fiercely proud of Sir Hans and his achievements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Restoration of emergency services at Downe must be top priority  ","story":"THERE is substantial disquiet within our community concerning the future of the emergency department at Downe Hospital.The time is now long overdue for the South Eastern Trust to confirm that its intention is to restore our emergency department service to its pre-Covid- level and to provide a firm indication of the date on which it believes that that will happen.Clearly, that date cannot be far into the future.Downe Hospital has played a crucial role in the emergency response to the Covid- pandemic. In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during . The programme called them ldquospecial people.My own personal memory of Alfie will always be the toast he iniably delivered at the end of an eveningrsquos conviviality, of which there were

We would need a period of reasonably wet weather before we would see a signicant change in the levels of most of our reservoirs.“There are a number of steps NI Water can take to alleviate the stress on reservoirs including a hosepipe ban.However, the key to conserving water is public action now.How we all use our water now will have a massive impact on our water levels during the summer months and on whether a hosepipe ban will be required.“For example, we know from the increase in our night usage some customers are leaving sprinklers and hoses on overnight we are appealing to them to stop.A sprinkler left on overnight is enough to meet the daily water needs of  families. We are also asking people to think before they use their pressure washer. Could the task be put off until we are out of this dry period  “However, the easiest way for everyone to save a little water and make a big dference is through normal household tasks.If each of us turned off the tap when brushing our teeth, in a month we would save enough water for the daily handwashing of  people.  “Similarly,you put a jug of water into the fridge rather than running the tap, those actions alone would save approximately  litres per day.This is enough to keep  people hydrated for a whole day! “We want everyone to enjoy their home and garden, we just need people to think about how they use their water andwhat they are doing is essential.If it is not essential we would really appeal to people not do it at the moment.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

Baxter.“Given the current economic situation, as a party we have discussed a fitting and inexpensive way to mark this signicant anniversary.“At Council’s next monthly meeting we will propose that Council officially name the new leisure centre in Craigavon at the south lake as the ‘Centenary Leisure Centre’.“No official name had ever been discussed until this week so we feel it’s very

investment to the area.”The centre had been due to open in August of this year but this has been delayed due to the coronavirus lockdown.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"
