These included nine valued at more than £250,000.The most expensive was the construction of a new conservation workshop on the site of the disused mushroom shed in the Home Park area of Windsor Castle, at a cost of £2.2 million, funded by the Royal Collection Trust.A further £1.4 million was spent on a replacement roof to Apartment 1, Kensington Palace - former home to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, now occupied by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.Work is expected to start next year on essential maintenance to the East Wing, which will see around 10,000 Royal Collection items decanted elsewhere. The Sovereign Grant for 2018-19 will be £82.2 million - a core of £49.3 million, plus an additional £32.9 million for resurfacing the palace.

The most expensive form of royal travel, mile for mile, is the royal train which costs approximately £20,000 per journey. Charles took seven journeys on it, which has sumptuous sleeping and dining cars.He also billed taxpayers £15,385 to charter a plane for a private day trip to London from Birkhall, his estate in Scotland. Aides declined to explain the reason but admitted there was no official engagement, saying royals were ‘allowed to travel from residence to residence’.The public paid £18,170 for Prince William to join the Passchendaele centenary commemoration in Belgium last July – and a further £30,414 to hire a separate private plane for Prince Charles to go too.

Prince William flies privately internally in a country, but takes commercial planes to fly abroad, costing a lot less than his father The rise in Charles’s travel bill is in part down to the fact that, as heir to the throne, he is undertaking more travel on behalf of the Queen, who has stepped down from foreign tours in view of her age.The Prince of Wales derives most of his money from the Duchy of Cornwall, an estate of mainly farmland and residential property that was set up to provide a private income for the heir to the throne and his family. His income from the Duchy rose by 4.9 per cent to £21.7million last year, while he also got £1.2million from the Sovereign Grant from the Government. The prince paid £4.8million in tax, which he does voluntarily, a rise of 2 per cent on the previous year.           Prince Andrew, Duke of York, Queen Elizabeth II, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge stand on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during Trooping The ColourYesterday officials said an incredible 10,000 precious artworks would have to be removed before the builders arrive in April.Some of the paintings, vases, tapestries and antiques will be loaned to galleries and museums around the country and the world.But others will be placed into commercial storage during the duration of the works.All 10,000 items are under the care of the Royal Collection, which has launched a massive operation to find them all temporary homes.          10,000 items are under the care of the Royal Collection, which has launched a massive operation to find them all temporary homesThe Chinese Dining Room, Yellow Drawing Room and lavish bedrooms used during state visits will all be pulled apart during the renovations - the biggest works at the palace since the aftermath of the Second World War.Leaky water pipes and dangerous old wiring behind the walls and beneath the floors all need fixing. Some 10 miles of pipes, 6,500 electrical sockets and 152 antique toilets will be replaced.The Duke of York’s private apartment will be affected by the works and he will have to move elsewhere in the palace. The Princess Royal, who also lives there, already has a second apartment at nearby St James’s Palace.Yesterday a senior courtier said it was hoped the works would not prevent the royals accessing the balcony for Trooping of the Colour next year, but admitted there was a doubt, saying: ‘It will be assessed. It needs to be safe.’ Another aide said: ‘We will be able to provide more details in the autumn, but the expectation is that it will be very much business as usual.’ He added the works were internal and there would not be any scaffolding on the outside of Buckingham Palace.

However, Canada Day is not the same as the day of Canadian independence.Although Canada as we know it first began to form through the 1867 act, it was still part of the British Empire, slowly splitting off throughout the early 20th century joining the League of Nations as an independent country in 1920.Total sovereignty was only achieved in 1982, when the UK Parliament moved the power to change Canada’s constitution to the Canadian government via the Canada Act.When is Canada Day?Canada Day marks the enactment of the Constitution Act, which was on July 1, 1867 and is thus held on that day every year.However, if July 1 falls on the Sunday, then Canada Day will instead be celebrated on July 2. That is why Canada Day 2018 will be observed on Monday, July 2. How does Canada celebrate Canada Day?According to Canada’s government site, Canada Day is an ‘opportunity to gather in our communities, from coast to coast, and to proudly celebrate all we have in common.       Canada Day celebrations are not limited to just people, with brands also getting in on the act. Skittles is partnering with the David Suzuki Foundation, a Canadian environmental group, to increase awareness about the country’s animal welfare.As part of the Canada Day celebrations the candy brand will be hosting live webcam stream of a man dressed in a beaver costume building a dam. It will give $10,000 to the foundation. The feed will start at 1.51pm EST, a nod to the 151st anniversary of the celebrations.In Ottawa, many musicians will be taking to the stage to entertain crowds on Parliament Hill and in Major’s Hill Park.Other fun events such as a live painting tournament, a miniature train ride and pop up shops will be happening around the Canadian capital.Bruce Willis Comedy Central Roast: All you need to know\u0026#8216Trump Baby\u0026#8217 balloon protesting President Trump\u0026#8217s UK visit may go on world tourDrake\u0026#8217s Scorpion album already eligible for platinum certification from the RIAAEx-RuPaul\u0027s Drag Race star Gia Gunn on gender confirming surgery World Cup 2018 - Sweden vs Switzerland: All you need to knowGemma Collins\u0027s private jet claims debunked by fans on TwitterIndependence Day: All you need to knowEngland\u0027s next World Cup game: When is it, which TV channel is it on and where will it be played?Big Brother 20 Spoilers: Who gets nominated on Week 1?Are Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas engaged?

He’s Westminster’s very own Celia Johnson. Strike up Brief Encounter’s Rachmaninov tune.Mr Skinner continued to yack at Bercow, even when offered the chance of putting the point he had wished to make. He complained the moment had passed – he had been interested in contributing to the previous exchanges.It was all down to the fact that he was not one of the Speaker’s little gang of pretty ones.Any Conservative displaying such open dissent to the Speaker would be given the most almighty carpeting by Bercow.We would have had purple-gilled apoplexy. We would have had ‘I can deal with this, thangyew’ and ‘I do not need to be told how to conduct myself, let him be in no doubt about that’ and ‘if the Hon Gentleman is somehow under the apprehension that he can cheek the Chair, I must tell him that he is sorely ill-advised’ and so forth.He would have made a tremendous to-do about it.But Mr Skinner is not treated that way. Why? Because Bercow is scared of him. It is partly a classregional thing – middle-class Southerner Bercow is timid in the face of Mr Skinner’s more Northern and working-class ways – but it is also because Bercow, like any bully, is a coward who shies away from people who fight back.          John Bercow \u0027like any bully, is a coward who shies away from people who fight back\u0027And so he settled for dealing with Mr Skinner’s testiness by saying, ‘I hope his mood improves’ – and, a short while later, letting him put an indignant but rambling question to new trade minister George Hollingbery.Mr Hollingbery announced that he hadn’t got a clue what Mr Skinner’s question was about. End of scene.Mr Skinner may never have much liked Bercow. Stalwart socialists such as he find Bercow’s drift to the Centre-Left unpersuasive and opportunistic. But he has a point, hasn’t he? This Speaker does have very obvious favourites.A short while later, for instance, he called Dame Barry Sheerman (Lab, Huddersfield), an interminable figure who is as wet as a labrador’s nose but is forever being invited to give Parliament the benefit of his opinions. The moment ‘Sheerman’ was uttered by Bercow, Mr Skinner turned and said to an Ulsterman sitting behind him: ‘That’s one of his favourites!’Who else is in the Bercow club? Let us see. ‘Mister Kenneth Claaaaaaarke,’ as Bercow pronounces it, is a prominent member. Others: Labour’s Chris Bryant (Rhondda), though he has started to take the mickey a sycophantic Cardiff man called Doughty Carshalton’s Tom Brake, one of the few Lib Dems to receive his encouragement unscintillating Scots Nats Joanna Cherry (Edinburgh SW) and Peter Grant (Glenrothes) Tory harrumpher Sir Edward Leigh (Gainsborough) and Julian Lewis (Con, New Forest E), who was Bercow’s best man and whom he invariably hails as ‘the good doctor’ (he has a PhD).A proper Speaker would not indulge favourites. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/28/07/4D7DE5D300000578-0-The_inquest_into_the_death_of_former_Love_Island_star_Sophie_Gra-a-33_1530168289350.jpg","title":"Danny Dyer calls David Cameron t t Brexit chat Corbyn Good Evening Britain","story":"Host Piers Morgan (second left) described the panel (Danny Dyer left, Jeremy Corbyn second right and Pamela Anderson far right) as the \u0027most weird and eclectic mix of people ever amassed on television as he chaired the debate with co-host Susanna Reid (centre)Heartbroken family of Love Island star Sophie Gradon stay...\u0027Has Nigel gone to the hairdresser and asked for a Donald...Share this article    Viewers took to Twitter to hail the TV hardman an unlikely political hero          Danny Dyer\u0027s straight talking on Brexit struck a chord with viewers who said he talked more sense than politicians           The EastEnders star spoke for many across Britain when he said that people have no idea what is going on with Brexit           Viewers hailed the actor, whose daughter Dani is starring in Love Island, as their hero          Many Britain have grown fed up as over two years after they voted for Brexit is remains unclear what the future deal will look like           Alex Lowe was among the many viewers who took to Twitter to praise Danny Dyer for slamming David Cameron Dyer became an unlikely political hero after he tore into the former Tory leader as he appeared on the TV show to talk about football, Love island and politics.He said: \u0027Let\u0027s go back to this whole Brexit thing, when you\u0027re judging them because they don\u0027t know what Brexit is.\u0027Who know\u0027s about Brexit?

Among them is Elizabeth the Queen Mother (1900-202), seen above in the 1920s. She was born the Honourable Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon on August 4, 1900. She spent her early childhood at St Paul\u0027s Waldenbury in Hertfordshire. When her father inherited his Earldom in 1904, she became Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon          Elizabeth the Queen Mother, in 1920. On April 26, 1923, she married HRH The Duke of York (Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George), The King and Queen\u0027s second son, in Westminster Abbey. They had two children - Princess Elizabeth (the current Queen) and Princess Margaret          This striking colourised shot from 1911 shows George V (1865-1936), the Queen\u0027s grandfather. The second son of Edward VII - and grandson of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert - he reigned from 1910 to 1936. He was born into the the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. In 1893, he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, and went on to have five sons, including Albert, who would be crowned George VI. The royal family became known as the House of Windsor in 1917 when King George V dropped the German surname Saxe-Coburg-Gotha amid anti-German feeling during the First World War          Princess Margaret (1930-2002) - seen above in 1950 - was the younger daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and sister to The Queen. She was born on August 21, 1930. The Princess played an active role in the Royal Family\u0027s public work, supporting The Queen. During her lifetime, she was patron or president of more than 80 organisations, including ballet companies and children\u0027s charities. She married Antony Armstrong-Jones (who later became Earl of Snowdon) in 1960 their marriage was dissolved in 1978. Two of her children with him survive her: Lord Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto          Seen here is the Queen\u0027s grandmother - Queen Mary of Teck (1867-1953), who was the consort of King George V. Born and raised in England, she was the only daughter of Prinz von Teck, a member of the royal house of Württemberg, a historical German territory. Mary was the mother of kings Edward VIII (later Duke of Windsor he abdicated to marry American socialite Wallis Simpson) and George VI          HRH Princess Mary (1897-1965) is seen here, on piano in 1915.  The only daughter of King George V and Queen Mary, she was born at York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate. She was the third of the six children of her parents, who were the Duke and Duchess of York at the time of her birth          HRH Prince Henry (1900-1974), son of King George V, is seen here in 1924. The third son of George V and Queen Mary, he was created Duke of Gloucester in 1928. In 1921, he joined the 10th Royal Hussars. During the Second World War, he served as Chief Liaison Officer between the British and French armies in Europe and (from 1941) as second in command of the 20th Armoured Brigade. He married Princess Alice in 1935 and went on to have two sons, Princes William and Richard          The Queen and Prince Philip with baby Anne in 1950. Princess Elizabeth and Philip first met when they attended the wedding of his cousin, Princess Marina of Greece to The Duke of Kent, who was an uncle of Elizabeth, in 1934. Their engagement was announced on July 9, 1947 and the couple were married in Westminster Abbey on November 20 the same year. Prince Charles, now The Prince of Wales, heir apparent to the throne, was born in 1948, and his sister, Princess Anne, now The Princess Royal, two years later. Their third child, Prince Andrew, arrived in 1960 and the fourth, Prince Edward, in 1964The original black and white photographs were painstakingly colourised by housewife Nicola Branson, 47, from Wellingborough, Norhtamptonshire. \u0027I decided to look at the Royals for colouring as a private project originally that I was going to share on my Instagram account.

My dad, a few months before he died, said to me, What\u0027s the point of having all these photos when now you can keep them on your phone or PC?.\u0027My response was that they are all memories - and memories can live forever. Through today\u0027s technology, old photos can be restored and colour added - those people can have pride of place in a photo frame.\u0027The royal family became known as the House of Windsor in 1917 when the Queen’s grandfather King George V dropped the German surname Saxe-Coburg-Gotha amid anti-German feeling during the First World War.     Mary of Teck, pictured in 1889. At the time, she was known as Princess Victoria Mary. In the run-up to the birth of William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s second child, Charlotte, in 2015, there was intense speculation among bookmakers that she was also going to be called Mary          HRH King Edward VII (1841-1910), above in 1902. The future Edward VII was born on November 9, 1841, at Buckingham Palace. He was the first-born son and second child of Queen Victoria and her consort, Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. During his mother\u0027s reign, he undertook public duties but was excluded by his mother from acting as her deputy until 1898. His high society lifestyle as Prince of Wales caused her considerable misgiving. Edward was 59 when he became king, having been heir apparent for longer than anyone else previously in British history. In 1863, he married Alexandra of Denmark. They had six children, including George V          Princess Mary (1897-1965) and son George Henry, in 1923. Mary was born during the reign of her great-grandmother, Queen Victoria          Princess Margaret Rose with the Queen Mother. Margaret was born on August 21, 1930. The Princess was educated at home with her sister Princess Elizabeth (now The Queen). She learned to ride, enjoyed swimming and became a keen gardener. By the age of four, she had piano lessons and would go on to become an accomplished pianistMs Branson, who used Adobe Photoshop to restore and instil colour into the photos, explained how she became interested in the quirky hobby. \u0027I started restoring and colourising old photos by my interest in genealogy,\u0027 she said.\u0027When my dad died, I started looking at the old photos that had been passed down from my grandparents. \u0027I was intrigued by how they would look in colour after being hidden away in a suitcase. After all, life was never in black and white.\u0027It helps to have an exceptional eye for detail, as the detail required to bring them back to life all makes the effect. \u0027Many layers of different colours and tones are added to the black and white photo.\u0027Over the time I have restored and coloured photos, I love the joy it brings to other people, seeing their faces light up with amazement when they see their ancestor in colour.\u0027          HRH Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, above in 1950. After a successful naval career during which he saw active service in the Second World War, Philip began to focus on his work in support of The Queen following her Accession in 1952. In 2009, he became the longest-serving British consort (companion to the Sovereign), a distinction previously held by Queen Charlotte, George III’s consort. His Royal Highness also has many interests which he pursues separately to his work with Her Majesty, including conservation, engineering, and The Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s Award which he founded in 1956.

I can\u0027t remember the second goal but I can remember the first,\u0027 Mr Broadis said.The second and final group game was an encounter with the hosts, ending 2-0 to England and seeing them top the group ahead of second placed Switzerland.Six days later, England faced Uruguay in a quarter-final game that Mr Broadis resents in more way than one.\u0027Uruguay in the quarterfinals were hard because if they didn\u0027t win the ball they took the man. I don\u0027t think they\u0027ve changed in any way,\u0027 he said.After a gruelling encounter, England lost out 4-2 to the 1950 world champions.Recalling the build up to the 1954 World Cup and his Sunderland days, Mr Broadis said: \u0027I was at Sunderland and with the World Cup in those days club directors weren\u0027t interested in winning it.\u0027They were only interested in boosting the transfer price of their players.\u0027          He said: \u0027People are hyper critical.

Mr Broadis and his late wife also had a son called Michael.He said: \u0027It was dodgy when I went to the World Cup because my wife was pregnant but I was determined fully.\u0027When you\u0027re a footballer, playing for your country is the top and playing at a World Cup adds a bit of spice.\u0027Born Ivan Arthur Broadis on December 18, 1922 on the Isle of Dogs, London, Mr Broadis has led an incredibly rich and varied life, both on and off the field.He became known as \u0027Ivor\u0027 after an administrative error while playing as an amateur for Tottenham Hotspur during the war. However, it was to be for northern outfit Carlisle United that Mr Broadis kicked off his senior career, before spells with Sunderland, Manchester City and Newcastle United.During the war he became Flight Lieutenant Broadis after joining the RAF as a navigator and completing his training in upstate New York, where he lived with family.He completed 500 flying hours on Lancasters and Wellingtons and he was in Italy when news broke that the war was over.Mr Broadis returned British troops to these shores and remembers the emotion of flying back over the white cliffs of Dover.He was posted to Crosby-on-Eden, near Carlisle, where he met his future wife, Joan.Mr Broadis was asked by the Carlisle chairman if he wanted to manage the team at only 23, to which he agreed and is still the youngest player-manager in Football League history.However, the stint didn\u0027t last long and in 1949 Broadis became the only manager in Football League history to sell himself, joining Sunderland for £18,000.Mr Broadis was succeeded at Carlisle by the legendary Bill Shankly, an inidual he became close friends with and highly admired, alongside another well-known Scottish name.          In 1954 England faced Uruguay in a quarter-final game that Mr Broadis resents in more way than one. He said: \u0027Uruguay in the quarterfinals were hard because if they didn\u0027t win the ball they took the man. I don\u0027t think they\u0027ve changed in any way\u0027He eventually returned to play for the Cumbrians for four seasons and finished his career off in 1960 after a season with Scottish side Queen of the South, whom he is also the oldest surviving player.After his playing days, Mr Broadis continued his love affair with football, moving into journalism and working as a reporter for 45 years.When he was at Manchester City he started off his written work by contributing articles for the Manchester Evening News.Commenting on whether it was a difficult transition swapping the ball for the ballpoint, he said: \u0027I didn\u0027t find it a problem at all. I think it\u0027s essential to write exactly what you think.\u0027Having played alongside and against some of the greatest names in the game, including Sir Stanley Matthews, Ferenc Puskás, and a young Sir Alex Ferguson, Mr Broadis\u0027s favourite was another Hungarian great.\u0027Ferenc Puskás stole all the highlights but I thought the Sándor Kocsis was the best - he was some striker,\u0027 he said.\u0027I spoke to him after the game where we lost 7-1 and Kocsis said he\u0027d seen his wife only twice in two years.\u0027I have so many great memories and wouldn\u0027t change them for the world.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/26/14/4DA64BD200000578-0-image-m-36_1530019512931.jpg","title":"Former Dacorum mayor took life struggling menopause","story":"    Gillian Chapman, 55, took her own life after menopausal symptoms left her with constant nausea, migraines, and severe depression and anxiety, an inquest heardA widowed former Mayor took her own life after menopausal symptoms left her with constant nausea, migraines, and severe depression and anxiety, an inquest heard.Former Mayor of Dacorum Gillian Chapman, from Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire, was found by her daughter Shelley on February 20 after becoming more and more physically and mentally unwell.The coroner\u0027s court heard that Mrs Chapman kept a detailed diary from the day she realised she was going through \u0027the change\u0027 five years ago.These entries started in neat handwriting and descended into a scrawl in the days before her death.The combination of her symptoms led a doctor to prescribe her medication to lessen the affects of her depression - a drug the 55-year-old widow then became fearful of becoming dependent upon, the coroner heard.  Geoffrey Sullivan, the Senior Coroner for Hertfordshire,  told how Mrs Chapman had grown continually unwell  over the years following her menopause.She was suffering from constant nausea, migraines, tingling in her arms and legs as well as severe depression and anxiety.Shameless flytippers dump 400 TONNES of garden waste, window...Peers call for Chancellor Philip Hammond to bring forward...Share this articleThe coroner also detailed how the former mayor and councillor had become paranoid that she would become dependent on the medicine she was being provided by her GP to treat her menopausal symptoms. She also underwent a number of surgeries and procedure in an attempt to lessen its effects.

What we found was a diary containing a daily list tracking all of her symptoms, as it came closer to the day of her death, the writing evidently became more erratic.\u0027An examination of her phone also showed a number of searches regarding the question how much Mirtazapine will kill you, a drug used to treat depression.\u0027Shortly before her suicide Mrs Chapman had made a call to her sister, who reported nothing strange about the call at the time. However, it was very shortly after this conversation that she took her own life.Recording a conclusion of suicide and reading from the medical report Mr Sullivan said: \u0027Evidently she had begun to struggle under the weight of her many worsening physical and mental issues and, as a result, she saw fit to take her own life in a moment of impulsiveness.\u0027Mrs Chapman, had been involved in the borough council since 2007 having moved to Bovingdon, Hertforshire, with her husband Barrie in 1994 when he retired from a medical career in the Army. He died in 1997.She was the representative of Bovingdon, Flaunden and Chipperfield on Dacorum Borough Council before becoming civic head of the community. She was the Mayor from 2011 to 2012.For confidential support call the Samaritans in the UK on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here for details.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/29/12/4DC1109C00000578-5900699-image-m-66_1530273518158.jpg","title":"Homebase explores store closures putting jobs doubt","story":"Aussie-owned DIY chain Homebase is sounding out advisers for a potential Company Voluntary Agreement.The restructuring would come on top of a store closure programme that the retailer has been carrying out since February.A total of 17 Homebase stores have been shut, with another 23 earmarked for possible closure.

He’s Westminster’s very own Celia Johnson. Strike up Brief Encounter’s Rachmaninov tune.Mr Skinner continued to yack at Bercow, even when offered the chance of putting the point he had wished to make. He complained the moment had passed – he had been interested in contributing to the previous exchanges.It was all down to the fact that he was not one of the Speaker’s little gang of pretty ones.Any Conservative displaying such open dissent to the Speaker would be given the most almighty carpeting by Bercow.We would have had purple-gilled apoplexy. We would have had ‘I can deal with this, thangyew’ and ‘I do not need to be told how to conduct myself, let him be in no doubt about that’ and ‘if the Hon Gentleman is somehow under the apprehension that he can cheek the Chair, I must tell him that he is sorely ill-advised’ and so forth.He would have made a tremendous to-do about it.But Mr Skinner is not treated that way. Why? Because Bercow is scared of him. It is partly a classregional thing – middle-class Southerner Bercow is timid in the face of Mr Skinner’s more Northern and working-class ways – but it is also because Bercow, like any bully, is a coward who shies away from people who fight back.          John Bercow \u0027like any bully, is a coward who shies away from people who fight back\u0027And so he settled for dealing with Mr Skinner’s testiness by saying, ‘I hope his mood improves’ – and, a short while later, letting him put an indignant but rambling question to new trade minister George Hollingbery.Mr Hollingbery announced that he hadn’t got a clue what Mr Skinner’s question was about. End of scene.Mr Skinner may never have much liked Bercow. Stalwart socialists such as he find Bercow’s drift to the Centre-Left unpersuasive and opportunistic. But he has a point, hasn’t he? This Speaker does have very obvious favourites.A short while later, for instance, he called Dame Barry Sheerman (Lab, Huddersfield), an interminable figure who is as wet as a labrador’s nose but is forever being invited to give Parliament the benefit of his opinions. The moment ‘Sheerman’ was uttered by Bercow, Mr Skinner turned and said to an Ulsterman sitting behind him: ‘That’s one of his favourites!’Who else is in the Bercow club? Let us see. ‘Mister Kenneth Claaaaaaarke,’ as Bercow pronounces it, is a prominent member. Others: Labour’s Chris Bryant (Rhondda), though he has started to take the mickey a sycophantic Cardiff man called Doughty Carshalton’s Tom Brake, one of the few Lib Dems to receive his encouragement unscintillating Scots Nats Joanna Cherry (Edinburgh SW) and Peter Grant (Glenrothes) Tory harrumpher Sir Edward Leigh (Gainsborough) and Julian Lewis (Con, New Forest E), who was Bercow’s best man and whom he invariably hails as ‘the good doctor’ (he has a PhD).A proper Speaker would not indulge favourites. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/28/07/4D7DE5D300000578-0-The_inquest_into_the_death_of_former_Love_Island_star_Sophie_Gra-a-33_1530168289350.jpg","title":"Danny Dyer calls David Cameron t t Brexit chat Corbyn Good Evening Britain","story":"Host Piers Morgan (second left) described the panel (Danny Dyer left, Jeremy Corbyn second right and Pamela Anderson far right) as the \u0027most weird and eclectic mix of people ever amassed on television as he chaired the debate with co-host Susanna Reid (centre)Heartbroken family of Love Island star Sophie Gradon stay...\u0027Has Nigel gone to the hairdresser and asked for a Donald...Share this article    Viewers took to Twitter to hail the TV hardman an unlikely political hero          Danny Dyer\u0027s straight talking on Brexit struck a chord with viewers who said he talked more sense than politicians           The EastEnders star spoke for many across Britain when he said that people have no idea what is going on with Brexit           Viewers hailed the actor, whose daughter Dani is starring in Love Island, as their hero          Many Britain have grown fed up as over two years after they voted for Brexit is remains unclear what the future deal will look like           Alex Lowe was among the many viewers who took to Twitter to praise Danny Dyer for slamming David Cameron Dyer became an unlikely political hero after he tore into the former Tory leader as he appeared on the TV show to talk about football, Love island and politics.He said: \u0027Let\u0027s go back to this whole Brexit thing, when you\u0027re judging them because they don\u0027t know what Brexit is.\u0027Who know\u0027s about Brexit?

It is a film about men under fire, of course. But it is also a film about heroism, fear and sacrifice.Set during the Zulu War of 1879, it is a patriotic film, but not a jingoistic one. When the Zulus sing one last song to honour the courage of the British defenders, or when Lt Chard gazes wearily over the piles of African dead, there is rarely a dry eye in the house.          Even today, 54 years after its release, Zulu has lost none of its power. It is a film about men under fire, of course. But it is also a film about heroism, fear and sacrificeSo when the Silver Screen Cinema in Folkestone announced a special screening of Zulu to raise money for the Armed Forces charity SSAFA, they could hardly have made a better choice. Or so you might have thought.But some people see things differently. Almost unbelievably, this week it emerged that more than two dozen signed an open letter to the town’s mayor, urging him to cancel the screening.Their explanation is, in its way, a masterpiece of ignorance. ‘We believe,’ they write, ‘that the choice of the film Zulu, with its inaccurate portrayal of historical events and its distortions and racist overtones could have a negative effect on relationships within the changing and richly erse communities here in Folkestone.’ Where do you start with all this? Is Zulu markedly less accurate than other films (not least Hollywood’s recent versions of history, such as Saving Private Ryan, which ignored British and Russian involvement in World War II)?Not at all.Is it demonstrably racist? Again, obviously not. The film takes care to show the Zulus as noble adversaries.          Little House on the Prairie, pictured, is facing a boycott because of the author of the original books for \u0027anti-Native and anti-Black sentiments\u0027Indeed, the current Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi served as an adviser to the filmmakers and actually plays his own great-grandfather, King Cetshwayo.Could a charity screening of Zulu really have a ‘negative effect’ on race relations on the Kentish coast? Is it plausible that, having seen it, people will start throwing spears at each other, or barricade themselves in their homes and open fire on passing foreigners?Of course not.If this story were just a bizarre anomaly, it would be easy to laugh it off. Unfortunately, though, it is part of a trend.For there was another story about censorship this week, this time from America. Yielding to pressure from more self-proclaimed activists, the U.S. Association for Library Service to Children has removed Laura Ingalls Wilder’s name from its award for children’s literature.As many readers will know, Wilder was the author of the Little House On The Prairie series, published in the Thirties and Forties, which told the story of a pioneer family in the 19th-century American West.Turned into a hugely popular TV series in the Seventies and Eighties, the books are the embodiment of old-fashioned, innocent children’s entertainment, which makes them irresistible to little girls, even today.So why on earth take Wilder’s name off the award? You can probably guess. Wilder’s books, her critics claim, are full of ‘anti-Native and anti-Black sentiments’. The characters say things like: ‘The only good Indian is a dead Indian.’ Worse, they even call black people ‘darkies’.Today, we rightly regard such terms as utterly unacceptable, but the fact is that in the 19th century, when the stories are set, people really did say such things — and worse.Never mind that Wilder was a product of her time, as are we all. For when the activists shouted ‘Racist!’, not even the childlike innocence of her stories was enough to save her.I am not alone, I know, in feeling nothing but contempt for the disingenuousness, mean-spiritedness, sanctimony and intolerance of these people. I’m not alone, either, in feeling utterly infuriated by the cowardice of the authorities, who are incapable of realising that appeasement only encourages them to find a fresh target.  Films such as Saving Private Ryan ignored the British and Russian efforts of WWIIWhat I find really depressing, though, is that this is becoming such a familiar story. The activists make a fuss. The rest of us scoff, sigh or shrug them off as maniacs.But the authorities, terrified of being branded racist, give ground. And so, almost without anybody noticing, we take one more step towards a culture defined by the suffocating narrow-mindedness of the lunatic fringe. If that sounds too sensationalist, then consider this. Only a few months ago, a friend at Oxford told me that she no longer teaches Joseph Conrad’s novella The Nigger Of The ‘Narcissus’, because the title alone means she risks being branded a racist.Never mind that Conrad is a novelist of genius and that Narcissus is a book of note. And never mind that the whole point of reading fiction is to take us outside our bubbles, to challenge our preconceptions, to surprise and provoke us.Again, of course, it would be outrageous to use such terms about black people now, but surely students are capable of understanding the difference between moral values in the past and moral values today?The irony is the ultra-liberal censors, these new fascists of our age, preach about ersity. But they are obsessed by only one thing: race, or, more accurately, accusing others of being racist. They’re certainly not interested in ersity of thought, which might challenge their petty ideological prejudices.So Zulu is out. Little House On The Prairie is out, too. What next?An obvious target is anything written by a ‘dead white man’, to use the liberal fascists’ own jargon. William Shakespeare is out, obviously, because of the anti-Semitic figure of Shylock, the moneylender in The Merchant Of Venice, and the alleged racism of his portrayal of Othello (the ‘thick-lips’, as one character calls him). Who else? Dickens has to go, partly because of the anti-Semitic caricature of Fagin in Oliver Twist, but also because his women are all drippy, passive fantasy figures.Rudyard Kipling is definitely out, because his books show the British Empire in India in a good light.How long before the censors come for Agatha Christie, whose early books also stereo-typed Jewish people and who was also guilty of using the ‘N’ word in the title of one?And amid the current hysteria about sexual harassment, will any cinema ever be allowed to show an old 007 film?Where will it end? Well, it will never end. And because these censors have no sense of humility, they cannot conceive that people in the future will doubtless find us guilty of prejudices invisible to us today.By then, though, what will be left of Western culture? For if Zulu isn’t safe, if Laura Ingalls Wilder is not safe, if even the slightest hint of political incorrectness is enough to disqualify you, then nothing and nobody is safe.The truth is that these people are the enemies, not just of tradition or even of tolerance, but of the imagination itself.They talk endlessly about celebrating difference. But what they want to do is to suppress difference, control the imagination and rewrite history. And that, of course, is why they must be fought. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/29/06/4DBF7FBE00000578-5899703-image-a-18_1530251978082.jpg","title":"Moscow columnist accuses young Russian women acting like wh foreign World Cup fans","story":"    Platon Besedin wrote in Moskovsky Komsomolets: \u0027Social networks are overloaded with videos where young and not quite young Russian women are behaving like overused prostitutes with low social responsibility\u0027.

Among them is Elizabeth the Queen Mother (1900-202), seen above in the 1920s. She was born the Honourable Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon on August 4, 1900. She spent her early childhood at St Paul\u0027s Waldenbury in Hertfordshire. When her father inherited his Earldom in 1904, she became Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon          Elizabeth the Queen Mother, in 1920. On April 26, 1923, she married HRH The Duke of York (Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George), The King and Queen\u0027s second son, in Westminster Abbey. They had two children - Princess Elizabeth (the current Queen) and Princess Margaret          This striking colourised shot from 1911 shows George V (1865-1936), the Queen\u0027s grandfather. The second son of Edward VII - and grandson of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert - he reigned from 1910 to 1936. He was born into the the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. In 1893, he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, and went on to have five sons, including Albert, who would be crowned George VI. The royal family became known as the House of Windsor in 1917 when King George V dropped the German surname Saxe-Coburg-Gotha amid anti-German feeling during the First World War          Princess Margaret (1930-2002) - seen above in 1950 - was the younger daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and sister to The Queen. She was born on August 21, 1930. The Princess played an active role in the Royal Family\u0027s public work, supporting The Queen. During her lifetime, she was patron or president of more than 80 organisations, including ballet companies and children\u0027s charities. She married Antony Armstrong-Jones (who later became Earl of Snowdon) in 1960 their marriage was dissolved in 1978. Two of her children with him survive her: Lord Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto          Seen here is the Queen\u0027s grandmother - Queen Mary of Teck (1867-1953), who was the consort of King George V. Born and raised in England, she was the only daughter of Prinz von Teck, a member of the royal house of Württemberg, a historical German territory. Mary was the mother of kings Edward VIII (later Duke of Windsor he abdicated to marry American socialite Wallis Simpson) and George VI          HRH Princess Mary (1897-1965) is seen here, on piano in 1915.  The only daughter of King George V and Queen Mary, she was born at York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate. She was the third of the six children of her parents, who were the Duke and Duchess of York at the time of her birth          HRH Prince Henry (1900-1974), son of King George V, is seen here in 1924. The third son of George V and Queen Mary, he was created Duke of Gloucester in 1928. In 1921, he joined the 10th Royal Hussars. During the Second World War, he served as Chief Liaison Officer between the British and French armies in Europe and (from 1941) as second in command of the 20th Armoured Brigade. He married Princess Alice in 1935 and went on to have two sons, Princes William and Richard          The Queen and Prince Philip with baby Anne in 1950. Princess Elizabeth and Philip first met when they attended the wedding of his cousin, Princess Marina of Greece to The Duke of Kent, who was an uncle of Elizabeth, in 1934. Their engagement was announced on July 9, 1947 and the couple were married in Westminster Abbey on November 20 the same year. Prince Charles, now The Prince of Wales, heir apparent to the throne, was born in 1948, and his sister, Princess Anne, now The Princess Royal, two years later. Their third child, Prince Andrew, arrived in 1960 and the fourth, Prince Edward, in 1964The original black and white photographs were painstakingly colourised by housewife Nicola Branson, 47, from Wellingborough, Norhtamptonshire. \u0027I decided to look at the Royals for colouring as a private project originally that I was going to share on my Instagram account. But a few close friends who have seen me working on these photos suggested they were amazed how they looked more like a colour photo rather than a coloured photo,\u0027 she said.Celebrated royal photographer who took portraits of the...Prince of profligacy: Charles runs up £1MILLION bill jetting...Prince Harry leads surge in men growing beards as Britons...Share this article\u0027The Royals through their generations have all been very photogenic and my personal favourite is the Queen Mother. My dad, a few months before he died, said to me, What\u0027s the point of having all these photos when now you can keep them on your phone or PC?.\u0027My response was that they are all memories - and memories can live forever. Through today\u0027s technology, old photos can be restored and colour added - those people can have pride of place in a photo frame.\u0027The royal family became known as the House of Windsor in 1917 when the Queen’s grandfather King George V dropped the German surname Saxe-Coburg-Gotha amid anti-German feeling during the First World War.     Mary of Teck, pictured in 1889. At the time, she was known as Princess Victoria Mary. In the run-up to the birth of William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s second child, Charlotte, in 2015, there was intense speculation among bookmakers that she was also going to be called Mary          HRH King Edward VII (1841-1910), above in 1902. The future Edward VII was born on November 9, 1841, at Buckingham Palace. He was the first-born son and second child of Queen Victoria and her consort, Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. During his mother\u0027s reign, he undertook public duties but was excluded by his mother from acting as her deputy until 1898. His high society lifestyle as Prince of Wales caused her considerable misgiving. Edward was 59 when he became king, having been heir apparent for longer than anyone else previously in British history. In 1863, he married Alexandra of Denmark. They had six children, including George V          Princess Mary (1897-1965) and son George Henry, in 1923. Mary was born during the reign of her great-grandmother, Queen Victoria          Princess Margaret Rose with the Queen Mother. Margaret was born on August 21, 1930. The Princess was educated at home with her sister Princess Elizabeth (now The Queen). She learned to ride, enjoyed swimming and became a keen gardener. By the age of four, she had piano lessons and would go on to become an accomplished pianistMs Branson, who used Adobe Photoshop to restore and instil colour into the photos, explained how she became interested in the quirky hobby. \u0027I started restoring and colourising old photos by my interest in genealogy,\u0027 she said.\u0027When my dad died, I started looking at the old photos that had been passed down from my grandparents. \u0027I was intrigued by how they would look in colour after being hidden away in a suitcase. After all, life was never in black and white.\u0027It helps to have an exceptional eye for detail, as the detail required to bring them back to life all makes the effect. \u0027Many layers of different colours and tones are added to the black and white photo.\u0027Over the time I have restored and coloured photos, I love the joy it brings to other people, seeing their faces light up with amazement when they see their ancestor in colour.\u0027          HRH Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, above in 1950. After a successful naval career during which he saw active service in the Second World War, Philip began to focus on his work in support of The Queen following her Accession in 1952. In 2009, he became the longest-serving British consort (companion to the Sovereign), a distinction previously held by Queen Charlotte, George III’s consort. His Royal Highness also has many interests which he pursues separately to his work with Her Majesty, including conservation, engineering, and The Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s Award which he founded in 1956.

Rising from a series of limestone terraces above a scrubby valley of olive trees, this metallic box is the new $21m (£15.95m) home for the AM Qattan Foundation, an arts centre that its founders hope will stand as a “beacon of culture” in the occupied West Bank.“It is more than just an arts centre,” says Omar Al-Qattan, the Beirut-born, British-educated chairman of the foundation. “We hope it might be a modest microcosm of urban public life, something that Palestinian cities lack.”It is no small ambition, but then the Qattan Foundation has always dreamed big. Founded in 1993 by Omar’s father, Abdel Mohsin Al-Qattan, a Palestinian refugee who made a fortune in the Gulf construction industry, it now employs more than 100 people in the West Bank and Gaza, running educational outreach programmes and public activities with a focus on science, drama and the arts. Its efforts have always been dispersed across numerous sites, and Al-Qattan’s dying wish was to see everything brought together in one place, with a gallery, library, theatre, artists’ residencies and studios for dance and art, along with one of the first public plazas in the city.Look at a map of Ramallah and you will see several intersections deceptively marked as “squares”, which turn out to be traffic-choked roundabouts. Visitors to the new complex will enjoy the rare treat of standing on a car-free limestone plaza, where fountains will soon spurt, with a cafe and views of the rolling valley beyond, all shielded from the street by a long, perforated stone wall. The building’s multilevel terraces teemed with excited families at the public opening on 28 June, when more than 1,500 people showed up to explore the facilities.It is the work of Seville-based Donaire Arquitectos, who were chosen following an invited competition of small, young practices. They have brought a refined Andalusian sensibility to the arid site. “We are Spanish, so we had to bring a plaza and a bar,” jokes Juan Pedro Donaire, who relocated his team here for the last three years to supervise the work closely. “It has been years of fighting to achieve anything close to the standards we wanted. There are defects, but it is the best we could do while building under (Israeli) occupation.”They struggled with the lack of a skilled workforce – he says the best builders work across the border, where Israeli firms pay double or triple local wages – and endured endless delays, with imported materials held up by Israeli customs. The library shelves were mysteriously detained for three months, while a container of light fixtures a sheet of bulletproof glass needed for the gallery space to be able accept precious loans have yet to arrive.“We are used to the daily harassment,” says Al-Qattan, who received permission last year to visit his foundation’s Gaza children’s centre, after waiting for a decade, “but this is an absurd abuse of power.”Considering the constraints, the architects have pulled off an impressive feat and achieved a rare level of precision. There are some bodged details, but the result is far superior to most buildings in ramshackle towns of the West Bank.Greeting the street with a long, stone wall, it has the air of a corporate compound from the outside, and there is a defensive, citadel quality to its imposing presence on the hill. Once inside, you arrive in an oasis of calm. A shallow ramp leads you down past sunken gardens to the main gallery space (the largest in the city at 410 sq m) and down again to a small theatre, lined with Weetabix-like acoustic panels, and spaces for dance and painting, all of which open out on to a terrace looking over the valley. The perforated metal cube of the library and foundation offices emerges from this limestone plinth of cultural functions, standing as a glass box clothed with a pleated skin of louvres, giving a silvery corduroy finish. Glinting in the sun, it is alien enough to stand out, while doing so with modesty. As Donaire puts it: “We cannot be Zaha Hadid here. We had to be vernacular, but at the same time offer a surprise and bring something of international quality.”The shimmering continues inside, where a wall of aluminium, perforated with a traditional textile pattern, lines the oak-floored atrium. It is an airy space, flooded with light from circular openings in the roof, in a nod to Finnish architect Alvar Aalto’s Viipuri library. The two-floor library, teaching spaces and offices above offer spectacular views, while fresh air flows across the floors, helping to earn the building silver award Palestinian Higher Green Building Council – the second such project to be certified, following the Palestinian Museum last year. It couldn’t get a higher award, the architects say, because the required services simply aren’t in place. Great piles of construction waste spill down the hillside, awaiting collection.The fraught context is highlighted in the building’s opening exhibition, Subcontracted Nations. Once again struggling with what could be imported, the show nonetheless brings together an impressive range of politically charged work, from Bisan Abu-Eisheh’s speculative designs for Palestinian banknotes, to Alexandra Sophia Handal’s study of how expropriated Palestinian houses in West Jerusalem are repackaged for the Israeli market as “Arab style”. It is self-critical, too: anyone who has dealt with Middle Eastern bureaucracy will sympathise with the message behind Notarised by Majdi Hadid, a gigantic rubber stamp bearing the emblem of the Palestinian National Authority that greets visitors at the entrance.It is an ominous presence, and a reminder of the precarious situation. When you are waiting by the trash heap for a taxi, it is easy to question the viability of this gleaming new facility in a suburb not served by public transport. Al-Qattan says the foundation is in talks with the municipality about introducing a shared taxi route, or its own shuttle service, and he is optimistic it will soon feel more connected, given the rate of Ramallah’s growth.“But it is part of a much wider problem,” he says. “The events of 1948, when Palestinians were expelled from Jaffa, Jerusalem, Haifa, Acre, Tiberias, had a profound impact on the society’s relationship to the built environment. Because of the squeeze of the occupation, places like Ramallah were subject to this crazy wave of totally artificial immigration. There’s a kind of resentment and anger reflected in how they build and organise themselves. There is a temporariness to everything, informed by growing up in refugee camps.”He says the next big challenge is to think in a new way about Palestinian urban life and rebuild it properly, something that this new complex hopes to point towards. “We want this to be a place where strangers can meet, where ideas can be exchanged, where you can just come and be anonymous. A public space in every sense of the word.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82e625ef6a74726e19305b8f8d907325e3f4aa56/0_0_2480_3824/master/2480.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ee418620b94e355b11f40a42bb36ef51 1760w","title":"reality check that dress yanny and laurel and our fantasy land politics","story":"With smartphone cameras and digital message trails, ‘what actually happened’ is more available to us than it has ever been. So why is public life saturated in both illusion and delusion? When Melania Trump recently visited the detention centres at America’s southern border while wearing a jacket printed with the words “I really don’t care do u?”, the responses of Washington pundits were sharply ided. For one side, the jacket was a message for the other, there was no message. As the MSNBC journalist Chuck Todd joked: “Perhaps this is like Laurel and Yanny and gold dress and blue dress … each opinion is right yet somehow also completely wrong.” Those two globally popular memes produced a lighthearted, absurd sectarianism that reflects the polarised nature of our times.It took about three years for us to find a worthy successor to “that dress”’, whose true colours split the planet. Was it blue and black or white and gold? The illusory garment provided what is often called now a “teachable moment”. One implication for those in the wrong – the dress is actually blue and black – was obvious: we can’t trust the stubborn certainty of our perceptions. It also offered clear proof that others’ experience of reality can be at odds with our own. That dress was like a miniature morality play about the vulnerability of our beliefs and the subjective inner lives of others, all captured in a meme.Since then there have been some failed pretenders, such as an unmemorable pair of flip-flops with a controversial colour scheme. A picture of a woman’s legs briefly did the rounds: were they slathered in some kind of glossy oil or cunningly daubed in white paint to imitate the shine of light hitting a reflective surface? In the world of internet memes, we were cultivating an appetite for two-faced phenomena, and last month our appetites were sated by a disembodied voice that repeated a single word. Like the astounding blue-and-black dress, which appeared to so many, myself included, as irrefutably white and gold, this single word was broadly heard in one of two mutually exclusive ways, as either “Yanny” or “Laurel”.With each of these memes, some people could, with luck or effort, perceive them both ways. During the first few repetitions of the word I heard “Yanny”, clear as a bell, in a high nasal voice with a North American accent. Then, poor Yanny was overwhelmed by a deep sombre voice calling out “Laurel … Laurel … Laurel”. The person I was who heard Yanny feels gone forever.Both the picture of the dress and LaurelYanny are stimuli that inhabit a “perceptual boundary” – they are able to trigger two distinct sensory experiences. But our consciousness doesn’t like the ambiguity of borders, and so when confronted with these boundary stimuli our brains tend to generate an unambiguous perception.Scientists study these memes to assess what your choice says about you. I felt a ridiculous, warming pride to learn that those who saw the dress as white and gold had “more active” brains, despite this activity being the cause of a delusion. The sun went in, however, when it emerged that people who hear Yanny are more sensitive to higher frequencies, a talent of the young that diminishes with age.The idea of a “Laurel” versus a “Yanny” person activates our tribal instincts, mocking the mechanics of prejudice. After just a few weeks of this meme going viral, you can already buy merchandise to celebrate the ision – Team Laurel T-shirts and mugs with slogans such as “If you hear Yanny, we can’t be friends”. It can be easy to let uncharitable thoughts form about those in the opposite camp, whose experience undermines our certainties. Their position on the other side of the perpetual boundary challenges our sense that we are fit to navigate the world. In this way, these lighthearted phenomena have a brutality at the core of them. Part of their perverse appeal is the claustrophobic realisation of just how far we are locked inside our perceptual apparatuses.Our responses to these two memes echoes a more general feeling that our collective sense of reality is becoming destabilised in a way particular to these times. The prevailing rhetoric of our age is one of illusion and deception. Public discourse is now populated with paranoid terms such as “crisis actors” and “false flags”. In a mainstream voicing of once-marginal conspiracy theory, American conservative commentator Ann Coulter suggested that the scenes of distraught children separated from their parents at the Mexico border were staged. In Britain, the language surrounding Brexit has narrowed, so that each side regularly characterises the opposition’s view as delusional. Remainers and leavers accuse each other of “fantasising” about possible outcomes to the withdrawal, while a few weeks ago an unnamed senior EU official declared that the UK was “chasing a fantasy” in its negotiating position. Fantasy is now used as a catch-all term to describe all manner of posturing and rhetoric that in the past would have inspired a more varied vocabulary. Political naivety, expediency, bluffing, visions of a possible future, ideals, objections, propositions – they are all regularly made to huddle together in fantasy land.In A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens famously describes the years leading up to the French Revolution in two-sided terms. Those times were the best and the worst, he tells us, elaborating on their polarised quality: simultaneous wisdom and foolishness, a season of lightness and darkness. “It was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,” he writes. Today’s particular brand of incredulity – the idea that the way reality is being mediated is not a true representation of it – isn’t the opposite of belief, but rather generates its own kinds of dangerous certainty. Our political and ethical positions are becoming entrenched by the pervasive sense that public life is saturated with both illusion and delusion. We are regularly asked to view other people’s certainty as being the result of misapprehension.It is an odd time for such mega-scepticism. Why, when technology can help us record and broadcast reality, do we find ourselves in an era of such intense and deranged disbelief? Screen grabs of successful payments, text messages with promises, photographs of a clean bedroom on exiting an Airbnb rental: these can all offer “the receipts”, or digital proof, of what really happened.Most of us can now instantly become camera operators, using our phones to capture the man being pulled from his airplane seat and dragged down the aisle, or the racist tirade in the supermarket. Every day, bike helmets equipped with cameras log the truth of road accidents. In this way, reality is much more available to us than it has ever been. The dog-walking service Tailster promises that its “trusted” walkers will supply a dossier of digital evidence – GPS mapping, video recordings of the romp around the park – to assure you that the walk has actually taken place.But just as we are surrounding ourselves in this kind of visual certainty, the integrity of the photographic image itself is being undermined. In the last six months, the menace of “deepfake” technology has summoned up yet another species of impostor. Deepfake software uses machine learning to make convincing simulations of real people saying and doing things that they may never have said or done. A predictably swift and gross application has been to superimpose the faces of Hollywood actors on to the bodies of pornographic film actors. It is also possible to produce fake video and audio of politicians betraying themselves. One chilling possibility is that these programs could become so sophisticated that recorded material may no longer be admissible evidence in legal disputes. In late May, the New York state assembly made the first legislative attempt to protect people from deepfakes. The bill states that the “use of a digital replica of an inidual shall constitute a violation if done without the consent of the inidual”.As we advance further into this world of simultaneous corroboration and deception, a major ethical challenge will be to remember that the differing experiences of other people aren’t simply yet another form of assault on our own realities. We must avoid the easy dismissal of the opposite view as being somehow unreal, a trick of the light.The opening line of Ali Smith’s 2016 novel Autumn parodies A Tale of Two Cities, but strips out Dickens’s equivocation. “It was the worst of times, it was the worst of times,” Smith writes of our present era. The story begins with an old man who dreams of being washed up on a shore he thinks he is as naked as the day he was born. Smith’s narrator remarks how it “seems the self you get left with on the shore, in the end, is the self that you were when you went”, the moment of death. It may be true that we tend to be trapped inside our own experiences, guided by the inidual designs of our senses and the turnings of our histories. By nature we might not like to exist at boundaries and borders, or to dwell in ambiguity. But at least we can imagine ourselves on the other side of our certainties – where other voices speak silent words inside the boom of our own bold thoughts •• Laurence Scott’s Picnic Comma Lightning: In Search of a New Reality is published 12 July by Heinemann."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722a5edd8736cfc61aa6e96549cc9a0d8f9d5e24/54_302_7189_4314/master/7189.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8810b2059183f161689ee56f57169b","title":"oxford buses turn to uber style apps in on demand experiment","story":"Passengers can summon a minibus to and from any street corner in the eastern half of the cityMeet the new bus: not quite the same as the old bus. With echoes of the Latin American colectivo or Israeli sherut but in super-smart vehicles networked by Uber-style apps, on-demand services are popping up in cities around Britain – with the big transport companies unshackling their buses in the hope of driving cars off the roads.The biggest on-demand experiment yet launched this week in Oxford, where passengers can use an app to summon a minibus to and from any street corner in the eastern half of the city.At £2.50, the fare is a fraction of a taxi and only slightly more than the normal bus but the PickMeUp service is not limited by routes – although it will stop to pick up more passengers going the same way. With an almost identical scheme, ArrivaClick, launching in Liverpool later this summer, could on-demand bus services lure car owners onboard, cutting congestion and pollution?David Brown, the chief executive of Go-Ahead transport group, which owns the PickMeUp operator, Oxford Bus Company, is cautiously optimistic. Speaking at Oxford’s science park, on the fringe of the city, he says: “This is classic territory where it’s tricky for a traditional bus service to deliver. But with the new technology you can identify where people are and provide for them in a way you couldn’t before.”Brown says: “If you don’t own a car, how do you get there? If it’s your first job you’re pretty stuffed. And if people can’t get to work and jobs that leads to another raft of social issues.”However, PickMeUp is looking to attract the well-heeled professional, too: the six low-emission Mercedes-Benz minibuses have free wifi, USB charging points and comfortable seating for 17, and wheelchair space. There is no public subsidy but Go-Ahead has garnered some support from employers in the business parks around Oxford’s periphery to encourage staff aboard, to reduce their own problems with car parking and congestion. Testing the service, the  was notified by the app on schedule, at St Aldates in the city centre, that its vehicle would be on the corner with Speedwell Street, 200m away, in two minutes. No other passengers were aboard but some people had already become regulars, according to the driver, Ryan Palmer. Having switched from driving double deckers, he says: “I love it – it’s much more sociable. You get a hello on the normal buses but here you could really get to know the passengers.” Later, a bus arrived on cue at the science park, driven by Dawn, who enthuses: “I’ve been to places I never knew existed – and down some very narrow streets.”According to drivers and the firm, the service is proving popular with its 750 early adopters: for many, significantly quicker than other public transport and a lot cheaper than a taxi, with a similar level of convenience. Fares are planned to become dynamic – and potentially lower – when more people are on aboard but the current £2.50 fare will double for anyone seeking a bespoke ride along routes served by normal buses. “We don’t want to cannibalise our own service,” Brown says.The green shoots of on-demand buses come at a bleak time for many other services. Public subsidy has been squeezed, directly and indirectly, through years of government austerity: central grants to operators have been slashed, while financially stricken councils have stopped supporting routes deemed commercially unviable. Oxfordshire county council scrapped all bus subsidies in 2016, leading to the immediate disappearance of dozens of routes. Those villages are unlikely to ever provide enough demand for services such as PickMeUp to work, the company concedes. Phil Southall, the managing director of Oxford Bus Company, says: “It’s not going to solve rural bus problems overnight. But if people want to talk to us …”Data collated by requests to the app – built by the New York ride-sharing service, Via – can show where demand could potentially allow new, fixed routes to be created. Stagecoach, which gave a trial to a low-tech, landline version of on-demand buses along a linear route in Fife as far back as 2003, suggested that new technology could make them work in rural areas but would need public subsidy. It recently experimented with cab-to-bus tickets in Kent, an option First Group is developing with an app for “last-mile” shared taxi rides between homes and bus stops along a main route in Bristol. Other experiments, on linear routes, include CityMapper and Ford’s Chariot in London, and targeted, peak-hour ride-sharing schemes such as Slide in Bristol. Go-Ahead’s venture has the biggest scale and flexibility to date: almost 2,000 “virtual stops” in its app, operating from 6am to 11pm, to cover work shifts of employers such as TripAdvisor located in the science park. On-demand bus trials to date have not been unqualified successes: a scheme in Sydney, Australia, has been attacked as a scandalous waste of money after so far costing an average of A$100 (£56) per trip. However, Go-Ahead has pledged to run the service for at least a year to see if the firm’s £850,000 investment works. Brown says: “There is high travel demand and this links people for employment and social needs. If it doesn’t work here it won’t work anywhere. Then the car has won.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/454fd648524d97a12aa73d302cd96d410cf437bc/1_0_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=503ac523343049412712cbedcf6736be","title":"quiz how well do you know business jargon","story":"Want to get soaked in a thought shower?

The Quebecois love doing things all together, en famille – and in that spirit there is Moving Day: 1 July, when the majority of residential leases both begin and end. To call Moving Day mayhem is to prettify the truth of trucks double-parked three deep on narrow two-way streets, amateurs humping fridges up the city’s legendarily winding outdoor staircases (partly because nobody can get a professional mover – they’re all quadruple-booked), and creative Quebeckers devising all sorts of methods for relocating their stuff. On Moving Day, you will see bicycles pulling gigantic, self-made wagons, and compact cars with so much furniture bungee-corded to the roofs that homemade bumpers made of pool noodles must be employed.Prasun Lala, a technology researcher at McGill University and the École de Technologie Supérieure, argues that Montreal’s well-stocked rental market is to blame for the puzzling persistence of Moving Day.“A landlord is always looking for a year lease,” Lala says. “So if everyone is always moving at the same time, landlords have a better market and the chances of having months where an apartment is empty are less. If you find a place on an off month – say, January – most Montreal landlords will make you sign a lease that takes you to July, and then sign another one, beginning on 1 July.”Like so many aspects of Quebecois culture, including well-loved songs, recipes and turns of phrase long forgotten in France, Moving Day has its roots in the province’s colonial past. In 17th- and 18th-century Quebec, there was a fixed date – 1 May – for many legal agreements. It took until the 1970s for the Quebec government to abolish this law for housing leases, and then it moved all existing leases to 1 July because too many kids were being pulled out of school to help their parents move. Since 1973, then, Moving Day has not been law, but rather tradition – a problematic idea that refuses to peter out.It is compounded by the fact that many Montrealers move frequently – even yearly. “If you compare Montreal to a city like New York, where decent living space is such a commodity that a couple might stay together for the sake of the apartment they share, in Montreal, you have the opposite syndrome,” says Lala. “People are breaking up over and over again, because they found something more enticing down the block.”Kristian Gravenor, a local journalist, historian and author of Montreal: 375 Tales of Eating, Drinking, Living and Loving, says Moving Day has a political dimension as well: “It’s impossible not to realise that 1 July is also Canada Day.” In the rest of Canada, 1 July is popularly known as Canada’s birthday: a federal statutory holiday, formerly named Dominion Day, replete with fireworks, parades, street parties and a scary percentage of Canadians wearing red maple leaf-branded baseball caps with built-in beer can holders and umbilical drinking straws.  “Especially,” he adds, “when you also consider that Quebec has really intensely enshrined its own national holiday – La Fête Nationale, 24 June – only about a week before Canada Day.” But even with all Moving Day’s inconveniences, it’s easy to find Quebeckers who say they wouldn’t change a thing about it. “There is a very popular concept in Quebec,” says Gravenor, “described by this word s’entraider, something like neighbours helping neighbours out. People here take pride in it.”  Lala says he has helped friends on Moving Day at least a dozen times, “because they’ve all helped me more than a dozen times”. He agrees that Moving Day is a community-building activity, like barn raising. “Its feeling is of everyone being in something together.” He tells a story about trying to parallel-park his moving truck on Moving Day a few years ago. “The street was crazy with people and trucks, and I badly rear-ended my new neighbour’s car. Within an hour, her boyfriend was parking the truck for me. It makes me think of how, in Montreal, in the winter, if you see someone’s car stuck in the snow, you just go and help push them out. There’s no thinking, you just do it. This was the same. It was like, ‘It’s Moving Day. Disasters are to be expected.’”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0a3a815c81c250ba0525c5a9060e41fc7d4cbc6/0_103_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de2fa72691d628eb415793321b18cddc","title":"a treat for the eye candy coloured churches of south india in pictures","story":"Between 2011 and 2016, Sabine Haubitz and Stefanie Zoche photographed churches and cinemas whose architecture is a unconventional blend of western influences and local construction styles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deab72ffb79747d2e4dffc1d2e309db6a1fb350a/0_22_1719_1031/master/1719.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f509c677322bcf29567bfefe858aa7a","title":"marriage abolished civil partnerships inequality","story":"Marriage is an outmoded institution built on patriarchal inequality that has no place in modern societyIt is right and proper that Rebecca Steinfeld and her partner Charles Keidan have finally won the right to choose a civil partnership over marriage, the court having previously ruled that this option was open only to same-sex couples. Who’d have thought it? Heterosexuals wanting something that we’ve got being envious of it, even. That is a rare thing to happen, and we should savour it.But what I really love about this case is how it was fought on the basis that the institution of marriage is outmoded, patriarchal, and built on inequality. As a lesbian and a feminist who has long argued for the abolition of marriage, I appreciate their sentiments. I had worried that the case was being fought on an “It’s not fair, we want what they have” basis, which would have been insulting. But I have to admit, I do not want what they have had for centuries: marriage.“But you already have it,” I hear you cry, “Lesbians and gay men fought to have the same rights to marry as heterosexuals!” Not me. I, along with some other feminists, have long campaigned to abolish the institution, rather than to extend it further.But this has made me somewhat unpopular among some of the lesbian and gay community. It is as though I am arguing against equality, rather than marriage itself.Same-sex couples were only invited to the marriage malarkey because it was a failing institution, as orce rates rise among heterosexuals. Marketing marriage to same-sex couples was also a way of ensuring that we are tamed out of our semi-feral existence of “living over the brush” and having too much fun and freedom. Lesbians and gay men used to be virulently opposed to marriage, unlike today. In 1971, Jill Tweedie wrote in this newspaper: “Gay Lib does not plead for the right of homosexuals to marry. Gay Lib questions marriage.”Perhaps the battle fought by Steinfeld and Keidan could spark off a wider campaign to get rid of marriage once and for all? It could certainly do with a revival. When Diana Spencer was preparing to marry Prince Charles, in 1981, I proudly wore my “Don’t do it, Di” badge. I was involved in this vibrant movement, as were a number of progressive heterosexuals.Civil partnerships were created in 2004 as a means of allowing same sex couples to enter into a union that guarantees them similar legal rights to those who are married.There are differences between the two forms of union, partially symbolic and partially matters of substance. For a marriage, the ceremony is solemnised by the couple saying a prescribed form of words in a civil partnership, the couple can simply sign a document.Marriages can be conducted through either a civil or religious ceremony, at a registry office, church or wherever a venue is licensed. Civil partnerships are secular events, although partners can choose to hold a religious ceremony on the day.Civil partners cannot declare, for legal purposes, that they are married. Civil partnership certificates include the names of both parents of the parties whereas marriage certificates in England and Wales include only the names of a couple\u0027s fathers – for the time being.In terms of annulment the rules are virtually identical, although the clause that permits a marriage to be dissolved if one partner is \u0027suffering from a venereal disease in a communicable form\u0027 does not apply to civil partnerships.Likewise, adultery can be grounds for a married couple to orce though it cannot be relied upon to end a civil partnership.Those in civil partnerships and those who are married enjoy the same tax breaks and benefits – such as the marriage allowance and bereavement payments. Surviving civil partners are treated the same as widows or widowers in terms of rights to state pension.\u0026nbspWhile those who are married and in civil partnerships enjoy extensive legal rights, those who are merely cohabiting – 3.3 million couples at the last estimate – have no legal protections or property rights if one of them dies.I’ve been asked a number of times whether I support civil partnerships for all, such as best friends, or siblings. This may be a popular idea for property owners wishing to avoid paying inheritance tax when one of them dies. Surely this is not the answer? We have to think about another arrangement so that people who are not wealthy and have shared living arrangements with their sibling or their best friend do not lose their homes when one of them dies. I have never understood why being in a state-sanctioned couple means you get a tax break – isn’t it more expensive to live alone? The entire system has to be overhauled, so that we are not privileging couples and discriminating against those that do not wish the state to be involved in any way in their relationship, romantic or otherwise.One key fact about marriage remains, whatever the reforms and modernisations. Marriage is far better for men than it is for women. It reinforces the notion of women as property. It is no wonder men are happier, have better mental and physical health, and are better off financially within marriage than women. As feminist writer Bea Campbell argues in her book, The End of Equality, married women still do the bulk of the housework, and men do almost as little childcare as they did 30 years ago.The institution has formed the backdrop to women’s oppression for centuries, and it continues to do so. Forced marriage, child brides and polygamy all show how human rights violations of women and girls all too often come hand in hand with marriage. It was not until 1991 that rape in marriage was made a criminal offence in England and Wales. Today, it is still perfectly legal for a man to rape his wife in more than 40 countries worldwide.The achievements of feminism meant that women were able to opt out of marriage without being seen as spinsters or freaks, but in more recent years its popularity crept back up, with some women even arguing that it was a “feminist” act . Same-sex marriage did little to alter the institution, but has definitely increased its popularity further. I often feel more judged for not being married or having children than I do for being a lesbian.Progressive heterosexuals would benefit by joining the feminist campaign to abolish marriage. As has been oft said, marriage involves three rings: engagement ring, wedding ring, suffering. The end of marriage is the only way to ensure true equality for all.• Julie Bindel is a freelance journalist and political activist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b1d7236df69348aee6b1ee5e1b171e678ec4fe6/0_234_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e5ac0e79b2ba06e2dd3e6efb75d7284","title":"students durham university blame council selfish","story":"Students are selfish, annoying and isolated. That’s what the county council in Durham, where I study, proclaimed at a meeting this week. I can’t help conceding that they’re right.Durham is home to about 60,000 people, and the university campus to about 18,000. Nearly one-third of that latter group attended private schools before starting at the university. It’s not hard to see how an air of entitlement and privilege has become part and parcel of the “Durham student” stereotype – I must say, I am no exception.Every other Sunday, I spend a couple of hours at Durham cathedral greeting visitors as a “welcome steward”. My supervisor there, John, like many Durham locals, is from a proud mining family. By coincidence, I was with him when the news of the planned social broke. He needed a moment before he could take it in. Eventually he told me: “It’s disgusting”. He kept saying it: “disgusting”. Disgusting that students “think they can just go on the drink and make a mockery” of the town in which they supposedly live.Naturally, the university has decided in light of this conundrum that the best thing for the local region is to bring in more students. Four thousand of them by 2027 is the aim. When the council called students selfish, annoying and isolated, they weren’t wrong. But they were missing the point. Behind the scenes, there is a board of university executives who too often treat locals and students alike as an afterthought to their relentless plans for expansion.In addition to flooding Durham with thousands more students, the university’s 10-year development plan involves making dozens of construction sites across the historic cathedral city. Its language of “investing in the region” has been little more than smoke and mirrors: quirky independent stores close, big chains step in. As a consequence, all three of the major parties in the May parish council elections ran on anti-expansion platforms. The plans, however, show no sign of stopping. Our students’ union president, Megan Croll, confesses to me that it’s become her “single task” to convince the university to consult local and student bodies fully before taking decisions.So far, the steps the university has taken are enough to kindle hope, but they’re too little, too late. A “code of conduct” for students is good. A “community liaison officer” is even better, and community consultation events are exactly what’s needed. The university, however, must treat these policies not as boxes ticked, but as opportunities to listen and learn from what locals say. Only then can communities in Durham begin to find balance.Be angry at gown swallowing town if you like, but know the force that’s driving it. Durham University must be held to account.• Joe Banfield is a second year liberal arts student at Durham University and editor-in-chief of the Tab Durham"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c39f36eb50de2d034a51c2bef5142bf530f41681/0_0_7138_4284/master/7138.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9126e372c34200bd3b74d8e6a8ced6a","title":"unbelievable uk homes rent airbnb","story":"Eco pods, beach retreats and treehouses – just a few of the many unique properties for a home from home on your next UK break"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/728cd7ca31a3bc7fd8e14902e03bdcc9ea5a97c8/0_191_5733_3440/master/5733.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ac0a7231d056e8d6cdea0b611974a82","title":"boomerang children can be good for family relationships study","story":"LSE finds parents want to help offspring returning home after university, despite tensionsBoomerang children who return to live with their parents after university can be good for families, leading to closer, more supportive relationships and increased contact between the generations, a study has found.The findings contradict research published earlier this year showing that returning adult children trigger a significant decline in their parents’ quality of life and wellbeing.While no one is claiming that moving back into the family home after the freedom of university is free of tensions, the new study by the London School of Economics is more nuanced and finds there are “numerous advantages” for parents and children.The young adults taking part in the study were “more positive than might have been expected” about moving back home – the stigma is reduced as so many of their peers are in the same position, and they acknowledged the benefits of their parents’ financial and emotional support. Daughters were happier than sons, often slipping back easily into teenage patterns of behaviour, the study found.Parents on the whole were more ambivalent, expressing concern about the likely duration of the arrangement and how to manage it. But they acknowledged that things were different for graduates today, who leave university with huge debts and fewer opportunities.The families featured in the study were middle-class and tended to view the achievement of adult independence for their children as a “family project”. Parents accepted that their children required support as university students and then as graduates returning home, as they tried to find jobs paying enough to enable them to move out and get on the housing ladder.But a key area of concern for the report’s authors is that while middle-class children may benefit from the so-called boomerang trend, graduates from poorer backgrounds will not have access to the same financial support and will therefore be at greater disadvantage as they try to make their way in the world.The parents in the study were aware of the implications for the “post-children” phase of their lives, but they recognised that their children needed a level of parental support that was not necessary when they themselves were entering adulthood. Their overwhelming response was: “I’m still your parent. I want to help.”“However,” the study says, “day-to-day tensions about the prospects of achieving different dimensions of independence, which in a few extreme cases came close to conflict, characterised the experience of a majority of parents and a little over half the graduates”.Areas of disagreement included chores, money and social life. While parents were keen to help, they also wanted different relationships from those they had with their own parents, and continuing to support their adult children allowed them to remain close.One father said of his daughter: “I don’t want the same distance to exist between her and me as existed between my parents and myself.” The study, Helicopter Parenting and Boomerang Children: How Parents Support and Relate to Their Student and Co-Resident Graduate Children, by Anne West and Jane Lewis, was based on interviews with 54 people – parents and graduate children who had lived with their parents for between three months and seven and a half years after returning from university.West said: “Parents are really doing a phenomenal amount for their children in terms of the different sorts of support they provide. It’s clear that parents are much closer to their children than was the case previously.“All parents felt that they had an obligation to provide a roof or safety net for their children … Even when co-residence was reasonably positive, there were tensions for a large majority of graduates and parents.”While much of the focus of recent debate in this area has been about intergenerational inequality between baby-boomer parents and their less fortunate children, the study authors were also keen to highlight the dangers of intragenerational inequality.“Our evidence suggests that a key iding line in the future is likely to be between those in the younger generation who are with and without familial economic resources,” the study concludes.In contrast to this qualitative study, the earlier research into the boomerang generation, also conducted by the LSE, was based on analysis of longitudinal data from the over-50s in 17 European countries, excluding the UK, between 2007 and 2015.Researchers found that couples enjoying a new lease of life after their children had flown the nest, with improved marital relationships and fresh hobbies, may regard their offspring’s return as “a violation” of an exciting stage in their lives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19566909b2b8ef97b7973cf5dd90e733ec333150/0_0_2188_1567/master/2188.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc990504783bb4ac62febec64bda3de8 660w","title":"what wore this week cropped trousers jess cartner morley","story":"Would you rather look like Audrey Hepburn – or Oliver Twist?I have a confession. I haven’t always been completely honest.I fess up to almost everything: which fashions I think we should borrow from and which I think we should ignore what I have learned from my own outfits that worked and what I have learned from those that didn’t. The bit that I have sometimes fudged is that when I have these conversations in my head, they focus more on the degree to which clothes are or are not flattering than ends up on the page. I filter it out from what I say out loud.Now, there are good reasons for this. Whether or not they are flattering is the least interesting, most reductive way to talk about clothes. Spending the whole time craning over your shoulder to critique your back view in the mirror is the quickest way to suck the joy out of fashion. Also, the internal logic that tells me I “can’t” wear a short skirt doesn’t mean that someone else can’t wear one. Setting stupid rules in my head for myself is stupid enough – but setting stupid rules in my head for other people is a stupid step too far.So, anyway, today I sat down to write about cropped trousers and I thought, well, obviously it’s about getting the right combination of trouser width and heel height so that your ankles look OK. Then I thought, I can’t write that! Ankles hinge your feet to your legs, enabling you to walk. Any ankle that does that is a top-notch ankle. Which is true. But it is also true that most of us would rather look like Audrey Hepburn than like Oliver Twist while baring our ankles in short trousers.There is always an easy way to get an elegant line, which is by wearing very high heels with everything, but I don’t think a cropped-trouser day is usually a four-inch-heel day, so I try not to cheat. A cropped-trouser day is probably a relaxed day when you want to mooch about on foot. So without hoicking yourself on mega-heels, the best cropped-trouser strategy is to pair slim trousers with relatively dainty flats (a slender loafer is your modern version of a ballerina pump here) or to team wide trousers, like the ones I’m wearing here, with a modest block heel. (A chunky two-inch heel is infinitely more comfortable than a skinny one of the same height.) A bold, wide-legged trouser with a meek shoe looks unfinished, as if you have been caught in beta commute-footwear and have your proper shoes in your bag a slim capri pant with chunky shoes is a bit 90s girl band. Not that there’s anything wrong with 90s girl band as a look. I’d just rather go with Audrey, if I’m being honest. Styling: Melanie Wilkinson.

Regressive tactics advance at greater speed than creative ones and the obsession with statistics contributes to that.At this World Cup, more than ever before, we want to know everything\u0026nbspwith mathematical precision, even though football is beautiful when two and two don’t make four. Or when South Korea beat Germany, say.We want calculations to be proven correct before the game has even started. Big data and mathematical projections are making their way on to the field of play to tell us things I don’t want to know. We love football for its imprecision, its moments of genius and its mistakes, when the ball bounces badly and the left-back plays terribly because he’s had a fight with his girlfriend before the game. And there’s no equation that can explain that.Of course the data helps but in the world of play, like in art, we have to put a limit on it because these are realms of freedom. The big problem is that with every step we take towards “scientific certainties”, players lose a little more freedom. Freedom for what? To think. There’s a reason they’re the protagonists.It’s worth clarifying, so that you know who’s talking to you here, that I love football more than I love a team, that I admire any given player more than the greatest manager, that the ball fascinates me as much as the “science” of the game. In fact, I think football is the opposite of technology precisely because of its exaggeratedly human condition: contradictory, primitive, emotional.\u0026nbspSo you’ll understand that I see VAR as an aberration, for example. If we want justice, let’s fight for it – but in real life, not on a football pitch. Football is a child of its time, of a moment, and that identity as a primitive game exempts\u0026nbspit from the need to be all modern and cutting edge. Yes, I know: it’s a losing battle.Anyway, let’s continue. For some time now, a silent battle has been fought between those who know about football because they played it and that taught them endless things – lots of ex-players don’t even know all that they know – and those who, while they know less, explain it better because university gave them knowledge and the tools of persuasion.When football club directors are in a bind all they want is someone to lie to them offering a version of events that is optimistic and irrefutable, based on “scientific” evidence. (Speech marks are vitally important every time the word science is used applied to football.) The battle is being won by the educated. But a word of warning: we are underestimating, and risk losing, the huge amount of wisdom that exists on the side of those who don’t even know all that they know.Johan Cruyff understood that well and always mistrusted intruders. I’m not talking about coaches who never played – there are too many brilliant cases for that – but the army of people getting close to the game with sophisticated ideas that appear to have the solution to every problem. Some are obsessed with the mind, others the body, still more with tactics. They forget that players are people who play. It’s very useful to integrate every element, but the main one continues to reside somewhere in their instinct.An example: there are “revolutionary” advances (more speech marks) like using drones to film and analyse training sessions, allowing you to see what is happening from above. Daft and pointless, whichever way you look at it. But, careful, here’s the thing: the coach that doesn’t have a drone gets labelled old-fashioned even by the players themselves and that’s terrible if they want to stay in a job.We know a lot. Like the fact that a player ran 12.345 kilometres. It’s an admirable figure, in athletic terms. But, did he run to help? To get in the way? To give the ball to a team-mate? Or to an opponent? To bring order? Chaos? As he ran, did he think? We need the context. If not, let’s leave the numbers for something else.And where do the players stand in this evolution of the game? With every step, they become just another piece in the machinery. That requites discipline, responsibility, solidarity, sacrifice – all virtues found in a good citizen. As we continue on this path, intensity defeats the ability to pause, to slow down passing defeats dribbling predictability defeats trickery ... and on it goes. The coach wants control and that’s easier to achieve without the ball than with it, working on defensive movements rather than offensive ones, the ball stopped rather than in motion. As Antoine Griezmann said after the sad draw between France and Denmark: this is just the way it is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e86c94961fb0990fddf2e1397b2a0eee1c32c87/0_246_4656_2794/master/4656.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c802ad43ff82a1e52b725b4210c158e0","title":"ten things we learned from the final round of world cup group games","story":"Croatia have impressed the most, the fairplay rule isn’t fair and Africa hits a modern low at the tournamentGareth Southgate’s team is now in the “easier” half of the draw and everyone with an England shirt on can plot a route to the last four or, if you’re feeling really optimistic and totally blind to the country’s record on the big stage, the final itself. ‘Well played lads’ screamed the headline on the front page of The Sun, after an understrength England side lost 1-0 against Belgium to avoid a quarter-final with Brazil. This is the same nation that has won two knockout matches at major tournaments – against Denmark and Ecuador – since Stuart Pearce tucked away that penalty against Spain at Euro 1996. Colombia, for the record, were quarter-finalists four years ago and they’ve won six of their last eight World Cup games. Be careful what you wish for. Stuart JamesCroatia were viewed as dark horses in some quarters, fancied to go deep into knockout rounds, although it is debatable whether such a tag was appropriate for a squad that contained players such as Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic, Ivan Perisic and Mario Mandzukic. Either way, they have been the star turn thus far. When the draw was made, Croatia’s was the group of death. Nigeria had arrived with a reputation for youthful dynamism Argentina’s spoke for itself while nobody could underestimate Iceland. Croatia made short work of all three, particularly Argentina in a statement performance. They did not even need to beat Iceland but they did so anyway, with a starting XI that showed nine changes to illustrate the depth of Zlatko Dalic’s squad. Modric has been outstanding while all around him there has been slickness, savvy and ruthlessness. The players believe they can top the achievement of their country’s Class of 98, which reached the semi-final. David HytnerSo Japan are the first country to qualify for the last 16 via Fifa’s fairplay rule. There’s a certain irony to that, given that Japan played out the final eight minutes plus added time of their game against Poland trying, in the words of their coach, to “stay put”. They had no interest in passing forward, attacking, tackling or - the unthinkable – scoring an equaliser to take control of their own destiny. Instead, Akira Nishino, the Japan coach, openly admitted that he decided to totally rely on events 400 miles away in Samara and, with that in mind, sent on a sub to preach the importance of killing the Poland game by essentially not playing a football match any more. It should be noted that Poland were not blameless in those miserable closing stages, yet they did at least have the excuse of being 1-0 up. Japan, on the other hand, threw in the towel when they were losing against a team that had already been eliminated, and left Colombia to do the job for them. Doesn’t sound much like fairplay.

Milinkovic-Savic ticks all three, combining some fine point skills in attacking areas with an insatiable energy. And of course being 6ft 3in doesn’t hurt. Mladen Krstajic had instructed his team to play with a freedom and without fear in a must-win game against Brazil and at times Milinkovic-Savic and Nemanja Matic were effective in shutting down Brazil’s dinkier midfield. For Brazil this was the lesson for later. For those with an eye on his potential transfer Milinkovic-Savic looks a fine player in this company. He goes home without a goal or an assist. But he is only 23 and would stiffen Mourinho’s options in the way Mourinho most likes to be stiffened: more power, more height and a willingness to run relentlessly. Barney RonayCan you pick a winner with even the slightest degree of confidence? The draw for the knockout rounds may have taken on a top-heavy appearance, with several of the traditional elite certain to see each other off well before the semi-finals, but this World Cup did not need that kind of help to be unpredictable. There has not been one standout team and nor are there any remaining in the round of 16 on whom one would confer absolutely no hope. Brazil look as if they are slowly clicking into gear while Croatia and Belgium have enjoyed impressively sleek, comfortable progress through the groups everyone has a fairly long set of pluses and minuses against their names, though, and it makes for a fortnight in which further surprises are virtually certain. Perhaps this is what happens nowadays when teams are flung together at relatively short notice, bereft of the infinitesimal levels of detail to which Champions League contenders’ strategies are compared. But the Champions League is, for all its quality, entirely predictable at the sharp end nobody can say the same here and it feels like a refreshing boost for the sport as a whole. Nick AmesWhile size isn’t everything, Mexico’s coach Juan Carlos Osorio had a long think about the kind of impact it had as his team tried – and struggled – to play to their own style against an opponent with very different strengths. The height differential between Sweden and Mexico was striking before kick off as the two captain’s shook hands – Sweden’s Andreas Granqvist towered, almost 10 inches taller than Mexico’s Hector Herrera. Across the teams, Sweden’s starting XI was an average of roughly three inches higher than the Mexicans. Osorio complimented Sweden on how they played to their advantage, going direct, even if it was obvious it wasn’t his vision of football. “I deeply respect that way of playing,” he said. “It’s quite amazing to realise you can play in the same manner every game and compete and beat teams that play in a different way like we did. You compete with what you have. But as far as playing talented football? I don’t think so.” He was then asked whether he would sacrifice his principles for results – is losing playing beautifully more appealing than winning playing functionally? Osorio exhaled. “Fantastic question!” he exclaimed. He came to the conclusion it was OK to lose playing badly in this specific condition because they qualified. But without qualification he wouldn’t feel the same way. His job, he felt, was to try to find some middle ground, to play with flair but also be more defensively switched on. The footballing culture clashes bring into sharp focus the search for balance. Winning at all costs versus aesthetics is food for thought going into the knockouts. Amy LawrenceThe gold standard for World Cup collusion was the 1982 Disgrace of Gijon, but at least West Germany scored against Austria before both teams stopped playing to mutual benefit. France and Denmark on Tuesday clearly had no interest in scoring at all during a soulless 0-0 draw that could deserve its own moniker. The misery of Moscow? The lemons at Luzhniki? Gaming the knockout rounds is common, but rarely does it look so cynical. The level of play was so low that it was unclear whether both teams hoped for a draw or were intentionally trying to lose to avoid facing Argentina next round. Not that it would make much difference. Croatia could easily k either of these teams, and if there is any cosmic justice, both France and Denmark will be expelled from this tournament with great force in the round of 16. “We sacrificed everything to get the point and take us to the next level,” Denmark coach Åge Hareide said after the match. Including dignity and any hope of becoming a fan favourite at this World Cup with otherwise excellent football. Andrew RothFive teams, five first-round exits. It is the first time Africa has not been represented in the last 16 since 1982 and an equally unbecoming statistic is that this year three of those sides were out of the running before matchday three. Only Egypt failed to put up any kind of fight Morocco and Nigeria both played well enough in spells to feel frustrated while Tunisia were competitive and a decent Senegal side was, in going out on fairplay points, plain unlucky. The theories and explanations will nonetheless abound and it is worth remembering that every country, federation and set of players has its own culture and context that make sweeping conclusions very unwise. But it is still a worrying development, especially given that the mean level at which these countries’ players operate for their clubs is now so high. Perhaps this is one of the issues: is player production, often led by European interests through academies across the continent, being industrialised to the extent that some countries are producing too many of the same kind of footballer? That is only a taster of a complicated debate but one undeniable fact is this: it would be a better World Cup if the Confederation of African Football (Caf) could be represented in the knockout stage. Nick AmesPanama were 6-0 down when Felipe Baloy scored against England, but that did not stop thousands of them going wild in Nizhny Novgorod or millions of them doing the same 7,000 miles away – and nor should it have done, so you can stop your sneering. On Panamanian television, the commentator’s voice cracked and he began to cry. “My country has scored!” he shouted. Yes, they were beaten then yes, they were beaten again on Thursday and, no, they haven’t won a game. They have also let in 11 goals. So what? They were there, and that is quite something. The Panamanian league was founded in 1988. Of their squad, only five play in Europe: at Dinamo Bucharest and Dunakska Skeda plus one in the B team of Deportivo de la Coruña and two in the B team at Gent. This was no surprise. The coach had said that there were four possible results – win, draw, lose and get hammered – but he knew there were really only two, and they all did. But they competed and there were no recriminations. That moment made it all worthwhile. Baloy, who scored a goal that was everyone’s, and the player many of them would have chosen for this moment, was embraced by family and friends his embrace with teammate Blas Pérez was particularly symbolic. “It’s been a long career, with lots of falls and lots of sadness,” he had said before the tournament. At 37 years and 120 days, he is the oldest debutant scorer at the World Cup. More to the point, he will forever be Panama’s debutant scorer. The country hopes to have another chance – being at the World Cup is vital for their development, a first step rather than a last – but he, along with the five others who are retiring now, will not. This was it. Together they represent a generation that did something extraordinary. Sid LoweGareth Southgate was loathe to admit it, but what was most evident from England’s defeat to Belgium was a lack in true squad depth. The younger players, like Trent Alexander-Arnold or Ruben Loftus-Cheek, may have benefited from the run out in a match which determined leadership of rather than qualification from the group, but none of the new guard really did enough to displace a regular first-choice. Eric Dier looked ponderous in central midfield compared to Jordan Henderson, a player who suddenly felt progressive. Marcus Rashford, a scorer of spectacular goals but not a regular pilferer, and Jamie Vardy combined are a downgrade on Harry Kane. Loftus-Cheek, at present, is not as dynamic as Jesse Lingard or Dele Alli, while Alexander-Arnold, excellent as he was on competitive debut, lacks Kieran Trippier’s delivery at set-pieces. It was a good night for the absentees, and the hope is they will have benefited from the rest. Southgate will cling to the belief all those tried in Kaliningrad will be able to make an impact off the bench, like the cameos from Rashford and Loftus-Cheek against Tunisia, but this was a reminder those who began the tournament in the team are probably the best England possess.

But they hope he will be the face of their climb back to the topWayne Rooney made his first visit to Washington DC earlier this month. Had he picked up a newspaper he’d have been faced with images of sporting celebration in the city. The Washington Capitals’ victorious run to the Stanley Cup final captivated his new hometown, not always the most obvious of sporting hotbeds.ESPN analyst Michael Wilbon once called Washington a “minor league sports town,” but over 100,000 fans attended the Caps’ victory parade on 12 June. DC United, the team Rooney has signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with, haven’t registered in this way for a long time, if ever.Once a Major League Soccer superpower, winning four MLS Cups between 1996 and 2004, DC United have fallen on tough times of late. At present, they sit slumped at the foot of the Eastern Conference (although they have a few games in hand over other teams). Looking at their record over the past few seasons, particularly last year when they finished joint-bottom in the overall standings, this is an accurate reflection of their place in MLS at the moment. They are the worst team in MLS.But Rooney is a symbolic signing. DC United could soon have new owners, with Los Angeles Lakers minority owner Patrick Soon-Shiong reportedly close to a deal that values the club at $500m, and on 14 July the club will move into their new $180m Audi Field home. If the old, crumbling RFK Stadium can be considered emblematic of the deterioration of DC United over the past two decades, then their gleaming new home presents the image of their future. Rooney would be another statement of ambition.DC United, even in their glory days, have never been a club distinguished by big name players. Ryan Nelsen, Jeff Agoos and Dwayne De Rosario are club legends, but the signing of Rooney marks a new age. Not since Johan Cruyff signed for the Washington Diplomats back in the NASL era has the capital welcomed such a star. And yet the general response to Rooney’s arrival at DC United has been one of apathy. The former Manchester United forward will be the most high-profile Englishman to play in MLS since David Beckham, but in the eyes of most Americans Rooney is no Beckham. He won’t make the cover of People magazine. His family life probably won’t be discussed on TMZ. The signing of Rooney is not a cultural event in the same way Beckham’s was.What’s more, MLS is in a very different place to where it was when Beckham pitched up. Back then, the mainstream appeal of the former England captain was key in growing the public image of the American game. Now, fans are energised by exciting, winning soccer rather than fading European jersey-shifters. Atlanta United, with their host of young South Americans, provide the most obvious case study.That isn’t to say Rooney won’t be a success. This is a team that could use a player of Rooney’s quality to raise standards across the board, to at least give the impression of pedigree. Whether Rooney will play in midfield or in attack is yet to be determined. DC United are already well set for creativity in the attacking midfield role, with Luciano Acosta their brightest talent, while Rooney’s lack of pace makes him a sluggish option up front. However, given that only four players have scored more than once this season for DC United, he might well be needed in attack.The usual questioning that comes with any move like this will punctuate Rooney’s switch across the Atlantic. There’s still a suspicion from many that despite MLS’s growth in recent years many ageing European stars still see the league primarily for its pay packet and lifestyle (although DC isn’t exactly LA when it comes to weather and glamour). Commit to the cause, though, and Rooney will settle any doubt over his signing. He should look to follow the precedent set by Robbie Keane, who threw himself into MLS and became an LA Galaxy legend, and not that of Steven Gerrard, who split his time between California and the UK as he lasted just 18 months at the same club, retiring as a Stateside flop.MLS is a tough league no matter who you are. While away games in the Premier League largely entail a short journey by bus or train, games on the road in MLS see teams travel across a continent, often on commercial flights. DC United’s pockets aren’t deep and so Rooney will likely have to go through a TSA pat-down, shuffle down the aisle and wait at the baggage carousel just like everyone else on his way to games. This is perhaps where the difference between MLS and the Premier League will hit. Mario Balotelli, Javier Hernández, Carlos Tevez and even Andrés Iniesta were reportedly all considered at one point or another by DC United before they finally settled on Rooney. The transfer is a sign of ambition, the first hint of a DC United renaissance in years. If this original MLS superpower is to return to the top of the North American game, it’ll be traced back to Rooney’s arrival.For years, DC United have been held back by a stadium that hadn’t even been built yet. But finally they will move into Audi Field this summer and in Rooney the club sees a face to stick on a billboard, a name to shift tickets and fill seats. Between these two factors, DC United hopes to recapture the public. Rooney may not change a league, like Beckham did, but he could change a club.

By coming second and getting the Colombia tie, England now find themselves on ITV, whilst Belgium v Japan is BBC. Looking at England’s world cup performance stats for matches on ITV v those on BBC, it’s pretty clear that the Monday game would have been by far the most preferable outcome. Never mind Colombia’s technical excellence and attacking threat, the ITV curse is all that will be needed to finish us off! It’s my understanding that ITV have first pick on round of 16 matches and so England were always going to be on with them. BBC gets the QF choice should there be one.As for this curse, I must profess to ignorance so I wrote back to Geoff for some more detail:Since 1982, England have only won 1 from somewhere in the region of 1112 (can’t quite recall the exact figure) of the group stage matches shown by ITV. On the BBC their group stage record is 10 from about 1213. I’m pretty sure the ITV knockout phase record isn’t much better either (though since England’s knockout record is so poor that it might unbalance the data from later rounds anyway). Certainly the last time we had a decent looking team playing attractive football, ITV scuppered it in the ‘98 Argentina game. Deschamp speaks and it sounds like he’s on the defensive:“I’m not looking for excuses for the critics following the group stage matches. There were 14 players in our squad who had never played at a World Cup when we faced Australia, some newcomers started against Denmark, too. They lacked experience. We’re back to square one in the knockout stage... Some teams that performed great in the group stage were crashed out after the first round of the knockout stage. We remember that“I’m happy to train the French national team for more than six years. We’ve made it to the Euro finals, we’ve had many great matches... I care about tomorrow’s game most.”Where there’s a Wilson, there’s a way I don’t know about you, but for me the opening paragraph of Jonathan Wilson’s Germany South Korea match report was a tournament standout.This, then, is how the world ends, not with a bang but with a whimper. There are certain events so apocalyptic that it feels they cannot just happen. They should be signalled beneath thunderous skies as owls catch falcons and horses turn and eat themselves. At the very least there should be a sense of fury, of thwarted effort, of energies exhausted. And yet Germany went out of the World Cup in the first round for the first time in 80 years on a pleasantly sunny afternoon with barely a flicker of resistance. There was no Sturm. There was no Drang. Here’s J-Wil’s latest, a column on Javier Mascherano and how he has dragged them into the knockout stages, despite playing badly himselfSo near and yet so VAR As part of a bigger chat-a-long with the media, FIFA have also fronted up on VAR, with chairman of refereeing Pierluigi Collina, taking the lead.The world’s first celebrity referee had some interesting things to say, including this qualification on whether players should be getting booked for making the ‘TV screen’ gesture with their fingers as they demand some sweet sweet VARTariq Panja of the New York Times reports:Rafa Honigstein, ex of this parish, elaboratesDidier Deschamps’ France are first up in the round of 16. The French boss has been speaking to the media and I’ll try and find some quotes. He’s had his job guaranteed by the President of the French FA whatever happens, so we can look forward to a liberated attacking display tomorrow?In French team news, Benjamin Mendy is out against Argentina with a muscle problem.On the subject of Teams of the Group Stage (TOGS), Steve Hoare writes:“Why is everyone picking Kante? Just ‘cos well, it’s Kante therefore he’s an obligatory pick? I think he’s looked as average as the rest of the France team so far. Can’t we have Herrera in the enforcer role? I didn’t see the Sweden game but that aside he’s been pretty good.”Steve asks a good question, follows it up with an accusation of bias (it’s obligatory in 2k18) then makes a good suggestion. For me Kante, against both Oz and especially Peru, was the difference between France eking out a narrow win and dropping points. In a lop-sided team he was required to provide defensive balance all by himself and it’s a tribute to his abilities (not least of which is the reading of play) that he has been able to do it. Herrera was outstanding against Germany, but less so against Sweden where Mexico were minutes from going out. BREAKING (someone’s face with an accidental elbow): Marouane Fellaini signs a new two year deal with Manchester UnitedThought he was by far the biggest attacking threat for Belgium B last night ...A combative team of the group stage here, with a front two that would frighten you, from Joao Pereira in Portugal:Paul is back to take you through the afternoon, you’ll be pleased to know. Happy football-free day!My highlights of yesterday’s games were Davinson Sanchez’s perfect challenge on Sadio Mane and Shinji Okazaki’s attempt to run off a niggle last about 30 seconds of the second-half. Two wonderful moments. Was Sanchez’s tackle the best of the tournament so far?In an attempt to compete with Diego Maradona, England maverick Paul Gascoigne has got himself in trouble for saying naughty words on BCC Radio 5 Live. After Gazza quipped that he could beat Chris Chrissy Waddle at goal, Waddle told Gascoigne to “start talking proper now”, to which the Italia ’90 blubberer said: “I’m a Geordie, how the f*** can I speak ... ooh sorry, how can I speak properly?”Captain competition time … For legal reasons: there are no prizes.Despite the loss last night, these England fans are, unsurprisingly, pretty optimistic …No football today and to make matter worse I am missing all the games tomorrow as some of my selfish friends are getting married. I am also reliably informed that Michael Portillo will be in attendance, which is galling.Lucas has emailed in his team“Yes I’m doing this at work I know …” (Messi only for the goal he scored against Nigeria)Do not worry about work, Lucas, this is far more important. More lovely stuff from World Cup winner Jorge Valdano on football and it being anti-scienceITV’s staff are using the day off to play five-a-side. Having seen some footage of this, it has resulted in a final between Mark Clattenburg’s team and one captained by Ryan Giggs. Despite the Welshman converting a penalty in the shootout, his side could not get the better of Clatts et al. Will this result in another tattoo for the big man?In another fixture, Gary Neville bagged a penalty but Iain Dowie saw his effort from the spot saved, resulting in a loss for his side. Poor Iain.Good news! We tasked out writers with coming up with things they have learned from the final set of group games. . . Paul tasked me with coming up with my tam of the tournament so far - here is my effort …As Paul heads off to find the freshest falafel in London, I (Will Unwin) will be taking over for the luncheon period. Something to do at lunchAs suggested to me by my close personal friend Jihong Lee, Professor of Economics at Seoul National University, here is my team of the group stage. What is yours? Post in the comments or email me. It’s a 4-3-3 by the wayI see that the England “debate” is still going strong – in the comments, my inbox and on Twitter. My tuppence worth: England didn’t play to lose that game last night, but they made the result an order of second importance to resting players. Most coaches having won their first two group games would opt to do the same. Our opponents did the same. The reason for doing it was in order to give us the best chance of winning our first knockout game. I don’t think anyone in the England camp has said anything about this tie other than that it would be a real challenge, whoever we played. England, as Gareth Southgate keeps saying, have not won a knockout round game in 12 years. There is no doubt that Colombia will post a real challenge for England, and that we are not favourites to win. Creating a narrative that, if we do lose, it would be because we chucked away momentum is great because it could never be disproved. It’s also pretty arrogant. And yet it seems like the argument against resting is that it was arrogant!Right, on to more fun things …Out in Russia all is going swimmingly: it’s been a good tournament, with upsets and late goals a-plenty there’s been no violence whatsoever fans have been having a great time (especially Latin American ones) VAR has yet to blow up spectacularly. No wonder Gianni and Vladimir are always smiling!So hurrah for FIFA. They gave a media briefing this morning and a couple of interesting things have come out of it. First of all there has been a doping update which, according to the BBC’s Richard Conway, included the following details:Secondly, Fifa’s “director of competitions” Colin Smith stonewalled any complaints about the use of “fair play” criteria to rank teams when they are level on points, goals and head-to-head records after Senegal went out in favour of Japan yesterday.The Africans became the first team in World Cup history to exit the tournament because of their inferior disciplinary record in Group H. Senegal have not complained, however, and Smith said:We want to avoid the drawing of lots as we believe teams should go forward based on what happens on the pitch. This is the first time we’ve used it at a World Cup, so obviously we’ll review it but as things stand we don’t see any need to change it.” REST DAY activity. Try this quiz, filling the missing blanks in classic World Cup teams:First off the FA have confirmed that Fabian Delph has left the camp to attend the birth of his third child. I’m assuming that means he’ll be back before Tuesday.Secondly, Martin Gamage emails about the keeping situation:I don’t have a particular issue with England fielding a changed team last night. As Adrian (9:50) says, Southgate is damned either way. Where I do have an issue is with not changing the goalkeeper either (although I note that Martinez didn’t either). But then Courtois’ position in the team is more sure than Jordan Pickford’s. I really don’t think Pickford was impressive last night. He had two or three fumbles and arguably should have saved Januzaj’s shot. Surely it would have made sense to give Butland and Pope a half each. I know Southgate likes Pickford because of his distribution and getting involved in playing out from the back but I would rather have a keeper who saves the shots and doesn’t parry the ball straight back into his box. Anything else I’d regard as a bonus.”An argument for Pickford’s removal? Certainly some strong words. For my money the Everton keeper has been named the number one and that’s why he played, Get him more minutes, more time getting used to the system. As for his performance, there has been some criticism of Pickford for the way he attempted to save Adnan Januzaj’s strike that led to the only goal of the game. It has been suggested he was both in the wrong starting position and attempted the save with the wrong hand (his left while the ball was going right).Keeper turned pundit David Preece had some thoughts on this on Twitter last night:Meanwhile, in the comments, Insperationless writes:Suddenly and quite unexpectedly Tripper looks to be one of, if not, England\u0027s most vital player. Our new found proficiency at set pieces evaporated last night. It appears rather than a new wonderfully organised and drilled approach to set pieces England simply found a player who is good at delivering corners and free kicks.This is an opinion I have a lot of time for. While it’s an English habit to become obsessed about players who were hitherto an afterthought is an English habit (think Owen Hargreaves in 2006), Kieran Trippier’s positioning and delivery were mint in the opening two games. Trent Alexander-Arnold has received positive coverage on his competitive debut last night and quite rightly. But there was a discernible difference in the quality of the set plays last night, in my opinion, and Trippier will surely return against Colombia. Here’s the Goat in training today, having a scratch (or maybe practicing Ronaldo’s goal celebration)Jacob Whitehead has some thoughts on what to do with this REST DAY. One of those is to scroll through ‘football Instagram’, something I could not advise against more strongly. Feedback is already flooding in. I’ve got a message from Aaron Sheehan about the League of Ireland (not today, not today) and something from Neema Eliya which just reads “W wwwfa” (thanks mate)Krishna Moorthy has both emailed and messaged me on Twitter (breaking the recipe rule already) to ask:“If and that is one big IF Portugal and Argentina meet in QF the greatest question doing the rounds 10 or 7 can be put to rest But is it ever an even contest: it is equivalent to an exquisite fencer meeting Thanos?”First of all Krishna, I like the imagery. Ronaldo as Thanos I can definitely see. Messi as a fencer? Not so sure. The man can do more damage with his feet than a blade with a cork on the end (they put corks on the end, right?). It’s a duel everyone would like to see but, as you observe, Argentina have to beat France and Portugal Uruguay for this to have a chance of happening.The first two last 16 games take place tomorrow and I have to say I find them difficult to call. The early kickoff, France and Argentina, is tricky simply because France have yet to turn up. Argentina, meanwhile, might have turned a corner with a more committed performance against Nigeria and that late winner from Marcus Rojo. On balance, I’m leaning towards France but I think anything could happen. In the latter tie – Uruguay v Portugal – I’m backing the South Americans. They have three big men – Cavani, Suarez and Godin – compared to Portugal’s one (I have downgraded Pepe) and all are in form.So basically I’m saying the duel is not gonna happen. And if it did, Ronaldo would win.Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. Unless you’re in Senegal in which case you probably still have the curtains closed and are refusing to get out of bed with no clue what the time is. I sympathise with all Senegalese today, and Nigerians too to be fair. No African side in the last 16 is a loss and both sides showed enough to be deserving of a knock-out chance.So here we are then: REST DAY. I’ll be reposting old  content and stealing good ideas from the internet for the duration today and it would be great to hear from you too. Post below the line in the comments, obviously, or email me on paul.macinnes@the. Don’t use my Twitter, that’s just for exchanging recipe tips.And with that, I’ll hand you over to Paul MacInnes. Thanks for your comments and attention. Bye.Mexico’s bunny-hopping legend Cuahtemoc Blanco is now embroiled in the country’s murky politics. David Gendelman takes up the story here:A couple more emails from you the public: on the bookies’ prices, from Jordan Devine: “As much as I dislike Ronaldo, Pepe et al, I’m baffled that they’re 25-1 for the outright win. This is the same team that won a major tournament two years ago. With a proven goalscoring talisman (who may or may not have sold his soul to the devil). I wonder if someone might explain to me how England are 7-1 in comparison?” A reflection of where the money’s going isn’t it? And The Market is never wrong. Ever.And on the England over-reaction problem, from Adrian:“Surely Gareth Southgate is dammed if he does and dammed if he doesn’t. Think about what could happencould’ve happened. Play strong team, still get beat by Belgium - England are rubbish. Play strong team, win group, beat Japan, lose to Brazil - Should have finished second.Play weak team, lose, lose to Colombia - England are rubbish.In other words, unless we reach the semi finals, people will moan. Just like every other world cup I can remember.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00dca3cb3d4e989b2495b2556f4666aa4f8b7153/1028_1010_898_539/master/898.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de28fe84bd8489ede17e5417db5809e6","title":"world cup flop xi group stage","story":"The World Cup is the biggest show on Earth but not all of the greatest players have shown up yetBy Martin Laurence for WhoScored, part of the Sport NetworkThe World Cup group stages are over, three quarters of the games have been played and half of the teams are on their way home. Plenty of big names are leaving the tournament having failed to live up to expectations and a few more have been given a second chance to impress after their underwhelming displays. We look at XI who will not look back fondly on the first 48 games of the tournament.The Manchester United goalkeeper hasn’t replicated his club form for his country since usurping Iker Casillas as Spain No1 and he had a terrible start to the World Cup. While his error against Portugal – and the fact he didn’t make a single save in a game where Spain conceded three goals – ultimately meant little, with La Roja topping Group B, but David de Gea does not look himself and reports suggest he may be dropped for the last-16 game against Russia. Rating: 5.59Jérôme Boateng came into the tournament with serious fitness concerns and he was not helped by his midfielders, but he was truly awful against Sweden. The red card for a second bookable offence was saved him from making more mistakes in a lacklustre performance – and saved him from experiencing a fateful defeat to South Korea. Rating: 6.40Unlike Koulibaly, Sergio Ramos’ distribution from the back was typically strong during the group stage, but he looked suspect defensively in a Spain team that conceded five goals. One of those goals came after the Real Madrid captain had a moment of miscommunication with Andrés Iniesta against Morocco, with the defender at fault as Khalid Boutaïb opened the scoring. He will need to improve if he is to pick up the World Cup in the same summer that he lifted the Champions League trophy. Rating: 6.57In the absence of a fully fit Mohamed Salah, Egypt needed to be resolute defensively and hope the other standout players in the squad would give them a chance of progressing. Mohamed Elneny needed to step up but the Arsenal player was often overrun in midfield. While he kept the ball well enough, the 25-year-old didn’t break up attacks, completing just two tackles in three games as the Pharaohs crashed out without no points. Rating: 6.09After a frustrating debut season at Barcelona, Ousmane Dembélé’s path into the France team seemed to open up when Dimitri Payet picked up an injury before the tournament. Sadly, the 21-year-old has been an ineffective replacement for Payet, one of the stars of Euro 2016. Dembélé had more of an impact from the bench in 15 minutes against Peru than in either of his two starts. He has shown little of his ability to beat defenders and provide for his fellow forwards, completing just two dribbles and two key passes in 164 minutes. Rating: 6.47Given his incredible record in qualifying – he was the top scorer in Europe with 16 goals – Robert Lewandowski has been toothless during the group stages of the last two major international tournaments. He did not score until the quarter-finals of Euro 2016, a feat he will not be able to repeat this time around. The Bayern Munich striker mustered nine shots in Russia without scoring, hitting the target with just three of them. Rating: 6.43The one real concern for Germany before the tournament was their lack of a real goalscorer to lead the line. Those fears were realised in Russia. Many backed Timo Werner to fill the golden boots of Miroslav Klose but he will have to wait another four years, having carried little threat in the box at this tournament off the back of what was a modest season at club level. Without a goal from seven shots, he looked stronger when moved out wide against Sweden, but still underwhelmed as Germany were the big casualty of the group stage.

Yet gaps in the criminal justice system, ruthlessly exploited by sex traffickers, make escape almost impossibleby  Annie Kelly and  Mei-Ling McNamaraKate had spent three years behind bars at Lowell Correctional Institution, Florida’s largest women’s prison, when the letters from Richard Rawls started to arrive.Men had written to Kate in prison before, but this time was different. Although she had never met him, Rawls made her feel special. He wrote that he’d seen her mugshot online and couldn’t stop thinking about her. Somehow aware that she was getting out soon, he offered her money, a home and unconditional love when she was released.The letters promised Kate a future she never imagined possible – a way out of the cycle of prostitution and incarceration that had defined her life after a childhood of chaos and abuse. Soon, Rawls stopped signing his letters “Rick” instead, he urged her: “Come on home to your daddy.”“When you’re in prison, all you think about is getting out,” Kate says. “The hours go by and it really hurts to know that nobody thinks about you in there.“So when you get a letter it’s like a gift from God. He told me everything that I wanted to hear. He said I wasn’t going to be a prostitute any more, that I could go home with him and live at his house, and that he would be the love that I was searching for.”When Kate walked out of prison, Rawls, a career criminal and convicted felon with more than 47 charges for sexual battery, child abuse, drug possession and assault, was there to pick her up. Just as he had promised.“When I got into the car, he’d brought me two sweater dresses, a bottle of Heineken and a lot of crack,” she says. “I went right back to smoking crack my first day out of prison.”When she got back to Rawls’ house, Kate knew immediately she was in trouble. Instead of the comfortable home she had been promised, the house was filthy and chaotic. Cockroaches crawled up the walls. The windows were sealed shut. And hungry, chained pit bull dogs whined and barked outside. Inside the house, Kate found half a dozen other former Lowell inmates.“It was just crazy in there, really a living hell,” she says. “At first he gave me all the drugs I wanted, but he made sure that I watched him beat the other girls and I wasn’t allowed to leave his room. Then, after two weeks, it switched up and he started telling me that I owed him for all the drugs he’d given me, and now I had to go make him money.”Four months later, a heavily armed Swat team blew in the windows of the house and arrested Rawls, who was later convicted and jailed for human trafficking.An 18-month police investigation concluded that, over the course of five years, Rawls had trafficked Kate and at least 18 other women out of jails and prisons across Florida.At the time of his arrest, he was making thousands of dollars a month from prostituting the multiple women he was keeping at the house. Controlling them with narcotics, prescription pills and brutal beatings, he touted them on street corners and escort websites.Rawls remains the only person convicted of trafficking women out of criminal justice institutions in the US. Yet his case is by no means exceptional.A Observer investigation has found that jailhouses and prison cells across the US are routinely used as recruiting grounds by pimps and sex buyers. Exploiting gaps in the criminal justice system, predators are targeting some of the country’s most vulnerable and isolated women, trapping many in an endless loop of criminalisation and exploitation.State to state, the recruitment methods being used to target victims are broadly the same.The first stage involves finding potential victims. US public record legislation means that, in many states, anyone charged with a criminal offence will have their personal data posted on government websites. The information can include mugshots, home addresses and details of criminal records. In some states, details of arrests and charges are also printed in local newspapers. This means predators can cherrypick potential targets, find where women are being held, and on what charges, and – in some cases – learn when they are likely to be released. Information posted online can also include information on bail bonds set for women awaiting court dates. Becki, a trafficking survivor from Cincinnati, Ohio, said that in 10 years coming in and out of the criminal justice system, she routinely witnessed pimps and sex buyers using corrupt bail bondsmen to access women in jailhouses.Inside prisons and jails, the use of prison and jail commissary accounts – which allow inmates to receive money from outside to spend on food, toiletries and other essentials – is a key vehicle for recruitment. In many facilities, anybody can send money to an inmate.This means that many women are, in effect, financially supported through incarceration by men on the outside, who then demand repayment when they are released.Traffickers are also using inmate bank accounts to pay in-house recruiters to scout out potential targets. “When I was in prison I’d speak to my pimp every week and tell him about what new girls had come in and then he’d send me money,” said Chloe, a former inmate at a state prison in Ohio. “I’d tell the girl he wanted whatever they needed to hear to make sure she got in that car with him when she left. It was like ordering food off a menu.”In a remote and dusty prison complex in Venus, Texas, Anthony Harris, a former pimp who who was convicted of compelling prostitution in 2015, laughs when he is asked if he’s heard about pimps recruiting women from prisons and jails.When women are released, pimps wait outside to collect them “like a line of cabs”, says Harris.Over the course of the investigation, the  was granted access inside the Western Massachusetts Regional Women’s Correctional Center. It is one of the few institutions that acknowledges it has an issue with the trafficking of inmates.Nicole Bell, a trafficking survivor and founder of Lift, a local anti-trafficking organisation, runs workshops inside the jail to prevent inmates being groomed and recruited by pimps and sex buyers. She was repeatedly incarcerated at the jail when she was in the grip of addiction and prostitution on the streets of Worcester. “Trafficking for many of these women started with a relationship that turned exploitative, or a past that has led them to drug use – but because they’re involved in prostitution and addiction and have a criminal record, they’re treated like a throwaway population,” Bell says.In the US, trafficking is defined by exploitation, with victims controlled through fraud, force or coercion.“These woman have been hurt and exploited by people their whole lives, but society doesn’t care what happens to them,” says Bell. Inside the jail, female inmates showed letters from men they didn’t know. In an effort to befriend them, the senders offered to send them cash and provide them with money, drugs and housing after their release. This grooming process often goes on for months. “It gets so lonely in here,” says Jill, 24, her tiny frame swamped by a baggy regulation orange jumpsuit. This is her 22nd time in the jailhouse. “I have a boyfriend on the outside but he lets me prostitute, so does he really love me? And he lies to me all the time. When you get the letters from these men, sometimes you want to believe what they’re telling you is real.”She shrugs her shoulders. “When you’re in jail, you’re all alone. Sometimes, without them we’d have nobody,” she says. “My family won’t help me.”Many of the women here know the men writing to them are pimps or sex buyers, but say that without their support they’d have nowhere to go when released.“I know girls who survive in here because of the men,” says Katrina, another inmate. “Imagine you’re in here for a year and they’re supporting you. What do you think they want when we get out? Imagine you say you don’t want to go back to disrespecting your body. That’s just not going to fly. Nothing’s for free, I’ve learned that.”While many women in America’s booming $9.5bn (£7.2bn) sex trade work independently, pimp-controlled prostitution is now widely acknowledged as one of the most brutal and pervasive forms of human trafficking in the US.Of the 20 trafficking survivors who contributed to the investigation, the majority alleged they had been arrested multiple times for crimes committed while they were under the control of a trafficker.“Vulnerable women who are being controlled and exploited continue to be arrested every day,” says Rebecca Bender, a national anti-trafficking advocate. She says a recent move in many states away from arresting women for prostitution has been falsely held up as a solution to the criminalisation of trafficking victims.“There is little awareness that many women in a trafficking situation are also forced into many different illegal activities, which make them a target for re-arrest by the police,” she says.The impact of having a criminal record often makes it impossible for women leaving incarceration to find employment and safe housing, or to regain custody of their children.“I try to help them when they get out but we don’t have a safe house, so when they’re released the traffickers are the ones who can help meet their basic needs,” says Bell. “It’s a matter of survival.”Solutions, say advocates like Bell and Bender, have to start inside the facilities themselves, where there is an urgent need for staff training and more interventions to support women.Since the Rawls case, the Department of Corrections in Florida has implemented anti-trafficking training and awareness measures designed to educate staff and inmates about human trafficking.In a statement to the , the Florida Department of Corrections said it had fully cooperated with the Rawls enquiry and added: “The department is committed to preventing human trafficking and working with our partners in law enforcement to ensure any inidual involved is criminally prosecuted. We take all allegations of this devastating crime very seriously, and have implemented aggressive measures to protect our most vulnerable populations from this enterprise.”For many, however, support either in prison or outside is simply not available. “These are some of the most vulnerable, high-risk iniduals in our society,” says Bell. “At the moment, most are just trapped in a continuous loop of abuse and exploitation.”• Living in Freedom Together supports survivors of sexual exploitation in Massachusetts"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d46bad35ea877086accb1f068d2a0d35d627b3a/0_1288_5729_3437/master/5729.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=078a3a8483c2be2a18aa8a2e52284140","title":"cocktail of the week the hanky panky","story":"A sweet martini, with a twist50ml Italian vermouth (I use Punt E Mes, but Antica\u0026nbspFormula\u0026nbspalso works well)\u0026nbsp50ml dry gin (I use Tanqueray)3 dashes Fernet Branca1 twist orange peel, to garnishInvented by Ada Coleman at the Savoy hotel in 1903, where she was the first female bartender, the hanky panky is a\u0026nbsptwist on a\u0026nbspsweet martini, in that the traditional dry vermouth is replaced with sweet.

We\u0026nbspgot an alert around 8.25pm and rushed to the fire engine, where the printout from the dispatcher said there was a nine-year-old boy locked in a safe. Information sometimes gets lost over the phone, so I was doubtful. I was thinking, “It’s just going to be a cupboard that looks like a safe.” But I had to be prepared for everything.I asked myself: if it were a safe, would it be airtight? I was aware it might already be too late by the time we arrived. I had to plan for a tragic outcome. On the other hand, if we were in time, how long would it take us to open the safe? I knew it would be an incredibly difficult task. It’s what safes are designed for – not to be opened.It took less than five minutes to reach the property, a family home in south-west Berlin. I\u0026nbspwas still hoping this was nothing, but when I saw a woman crying on the street, I knew the situation was serious. She was the boy’s mother and she led us into the basement, where his father was waiting by the safe. He told us the boy was alive and we started talking to him he was very calm. We asked how it had happened: during a game of hide and seek with his five-year-old brother, he had thought the safe would be a good place to hide.The boy’s parents had inherited the house from his mother’s father. The unlocked safe had been there when they moved in and was in an area they didn’t use much. The boy’s little brother had shut the safe, then, when he couldn’t open it again, had gone upstairs and told his mum. She had followed him to the basement and called us immediately. The\u0026nbsponly person who knew the combination was the boy’s late grandfather.From the outset, the biggest priority was getting oxygen to the boy. All the experts we were calling told us the safe was airtight and he was going to die. We put a light to the door of the safe and moved it, and he told us where he could see it, so we knew there was a paper-thin gap. We got oxygen from the paramedics and put a small tube against the gap. The boy said that he could feel a thin stream of air.Next, we had to work out the combination: blindly opening the safe by force might have hurt or suffocated the boy. I asked his parents if anyone had opened the safe before and they said no. So we had to guess a six-digit code. We moved the safe away from the wall behind it we found some papers and a manual, which had several codes written on it. We started typing them in – but we had to wait 10 minutes between each attempt before we could try again.While we were doing this, the boy’s mother remembered that her brother had once opened the safe, so\u0026nbspwhen the codes we had didn’t work, she called him. He gave us six birth dates and anniversaries to try.By this time we had worked out a\u0026nbspway to reduce the 10-minute pause between punching in codes to just one minute, so quickly we tried them all. No luck.We were fully prepared at this point to open the safe by force, starting with a drill. We\u0026nbsptaught the boy to put his hands over his ears while we drilled, and to take them off only when we shook the safe then we cut a\u0026nbsphole in the back. It was dangerous, but I\u0026nbspwas confident that we could get him out.Then, just as we started to make the first cut, my colleague punched in the correct code. We’d asked the mother again to write down any significant dates and it turned out to be her brother’s birthday. We were amazed.We had been trying for three hours and now all of a sudden this little boy was standing in front of me, rubbing his eyes. He had been so calm the whole time, following our commands and talking to us, and his parents were so happy that he was out. He had a cuddle with his tearful mother, a checkup from the doctor, and then went for a\u0026nbspshower – he was sweaty and his clothes were wet from breathing in that tiny space for so long.Driving home, I was so proud of what we had\u0026nbspachieved. I remember thinking: “This might be the greatest thing you’ll ever do in your job.” It\u0026nbspwas incredible teamwork.Hopefully the boy will be more careful next time he plays hide and seek – but at least we know the combination to the safe now.• As told to Sophie HaydockDo you have an experience to share?

In a joint statement, the two sides said: “The BBC and Carrie Gracie have reached an agreement to resolve their differences.”The BBC admitted Gracie had been told she would be paid in line with the north America editor, Jon Sopel, whose salary is in the £200,000-£250,000 range, but after she accepted the role her pay turned out to be £135,000. Jeremy Bowen, the BBC’s Middle East editor, is paid between £150,000 and £199,999.Gracie has said she would donate all the back pay the BBC has awarded her to the Fawcett Society, a charity that campaigns for gender equality, to set up a fund for women who need legal advice on equal pay claims and to support its strategic legal work.“For me, this was always about the principle, rather than the money,” she said. “I’m delighted to donate all the backdated pay from the BBC to help women striving for equality at work. I am glad to be able to resolve this with the director general – it shows we can make progress. I’m also pleased that my work as China editor has now been properly recognised by the BBC and relieved that this difficult period is over.”The dispute with Gracie has been highly damaging for the BBC, as it attempts to address pay inequality and transparency issues with dozens of high-profile stars, including Victoria Derbyshire, Mariella Frostrup, Naga Munchetty and Samira Ahmed, who are campaigning for action. “The BBC is committed to the principle of equal pay in accordance with our values,” the corporation said. “The BBC acknowledges the specific circumstances relating to Carrie’s appointment, apologises for underpaying Carrie, and has now put this right.”The director general, Tony Hall, said: “I am pleased that we’ve been able to move past our differences and work through things together we can now look to the future.”Hall said Gracie would contribute to a BBC project, led by Donalda MacKinnon, to “make the BBC a great place for women to work”.As part of her fight for equal pay, Gracie wrote an open letter to licence fee payers criticising the broadcaster for the gender pay gap and its efforts to eradicate it. After Gracie’s resignation in January, some of the BBC’s best-paid male presenters – including John Humphrys, Jeremy Vine, Huw Edwards, Nick Robinson and Sopel – agreed to take salary cuts.The BBC said Gracie would now, at her own request, take up to six months of unpaid leave to write and speak about China and gender equality. “Neither she nor the BBC wish to comment on this further,” it added.Gracie has worked at the corporation for 30 years. She is widely regarded as one of the BBC’s most talented journalists.The gender pay row at the BBC erupted last summer when it published a list of its top-earning on-air stars, which revealed that just a third were women and the top seven were all men. This led to more than 40 of its highest-profile female presenters, including Clare Balding, Fiona Bruce and Emily Maitlis, publishing a letter to Hall."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bef65727691701f6f81afce2dcd9678842438491/276_286_2143_1286/master/2143.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75fd60631987d42ae4b361b94d9b979f","title":"all abbas uk singles ranked","story":"To mark the release of new film Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, we rate the Swedish pop band’s greatest hitsLast place for the band’s last single, taken from recording sessions for a ninth album that never came to fruition. And maybe that’s for the best: the dissonance between the robotic verses and a bizarrely jaunty chorus about being at one’s wit’s end over a stalker is too jarring to work. LSThroughout their career, Abba would offer occasional proof that they were a far from an infallible singles band. This was one such piece of evidence. Benny and Björn combined their loves of German schlager music and the American bandleader Billy Vaughn in a single that Melody Maker concluded was “so bad it hurts”. MH“Without a song or a dance what are we?” A poignant rhetorical question to which the answer is, of course, nothing. Still, there are better songs with which to prove it than this cloying number, to which one almost certainly cannot dance. LSA favourite for terrace chants – “He was awesome in the air tonight, his hair looked nice, Fernando!” as Liverpool fans once sang – the original Abba song is, somewhat improbably for a 70s chart topper, about two war veterans recalling the Mexican revolution of 1910. Regardless, it became one of their biggest-selling singles. TJA tale of trying to help a friend through heartbreak, Chiquitita offers up the perfect lyrical fit for Abba’s inimitable Nordic melancholy. Inspired by the Peruvian folk song El Cóndor Pasa, it was deemed so strong by the band that it replaced the excellent If It Wasn’t for the Nights as lead single pick from their disco album Voulez-Vous. TJA piece of glam-pop indebted to Wizzard’s 1973 hit See My Baby Jive (itself in thrall to classic Phil Spector) that transcends its influences at a stroke. From the pile-driving rhythm through those piano crashes to its brilliant opening line, Waterloo’s irresistibility is sealed within 15 seconds – and it remains the best-ever Eurovision winner. JHA simple, gospel-tinged song that borders on the saccharine yet still contains some subtle Abba mastery thrown in – note that hanging pause after “I believe ...” I Have a Dream features a children’s choir, making it the only Abba single to feature vocalists outside the band. It reached No 2 in the UK charts, though Westlife’s rubbish cover went one better. TJThe history book on the shelf could have read quite differently: rock wobbler Ring Ring was put forward for Eurovision consideration 12 months before the band made a more successful attempt with Waterloo. Worth noting that Ring Ring was penned in an era when a tinkling phone signalled potential romance, rather than a speculative PPI claim call. PRMamma Mia is a showcase for Abba’s musical inventiveness, from the way the opening xylophone playfully shifts from on-beat to off-beat to the cruising Beach Boys harmonies towards the end. Then, of course, there’s the way Björn and Benny drop everything for the chorus, bar Frida, Agnetha, that xylophone and a tiny, tinkly piano, creating one of the quintessential Abba moments. ANA rarity in Abba’s catalogue in every sense: Björn takes the lead on vocals, rock rules over disco and then there’s the unusually troubling lyrics, about a man who definitely knows better contemplating his attraction to a girl who’s “only a child”. The raucous chorus has weathered better than the message. LSPreviously titled Dancing in the Moonlight, the title of a 1972 hit by King Harvest, Abba’s 1978 UK No 5 pays delirious homage to nightlife, sexual attraction and the era’s disco boom. Oddly, the band have never been overly enamoured with it: our critics disagree. DSAs Abba entered their twilight years they got fascinatingly weirder. You Owe Me One, the B-side to 1982’s Under Attack, was a case in point: a snaking Middle-Eastern riff that sounded more Selda Bağcan than Summer Night City, Frida and Agnetha pitch-shifted upwards into Disney-fied adolescence and a breakup lyric that rode into white wine o’clock with a cackle. PEDivorces are grisly and bad, but One of Us, recorded after both Abba’s couples had separated, is next level: a despondent tale of loneliness and empty beds with Agnetha’s protagonist “wishing she had never left at all” in a song written by her ex-husband. Which puts arguing over a lawnmower in perspective. PRMoney, Money, Money suffers from being no one’s favourite Abba single. But the pizzicato intro is brilliant and the sinister guitar line underneath the chorus is terrific. The sentiment – find a rich man to shack up with – might be timeless, but it does feel a bit icky: the patriarchy is not being smashed. MHAbba on both autopilot and at the peak of their powers. As so often, the lyrics treat seduction as a transaction (the cynicism in much of the Abba catalogue is rarely remarked on). The faintly Arabic guitar refrain adds a touch of exoticism, the Earth, Wind and Fire-style horns in the chorus are fabulous. It’s just not quite perfect. MHDecades before Dua Lipa issued three rules for dealing with the troublesome ex you’re not quite over, Abba issued just one: “Don’t look too deep into those angel eyes.” Passed over for Abba Gold inclusion, this has the potential to be the surprise hit of Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again. Make of that what you will. PRWith its Stevie Wonder-influenced funk intro and slinky, soulful chorus, this 1977 No 1 is written from the viewpoint of a young, vulnerable person struggling with unfamiliar feelings, unsure if they are mutual or misplaced: “If I trust in you, would you let me down?” DSThe unusual a cappella intro of Abba’s seventh British No 1 originated in a rhythmic mantra that Björn hummed to himself while running. The lyrics are a classic tale of as-yet-unrequited longing: “If you’re all alone when the pretty birds have flown  Honey I’m still free, take a chance on me.” DSAbba’s final UK No 1 was a marvel: a spun-sugar melody with vocal harmonies so tightly arranged and recorded they sound barely human. You might think it’s a nursery rhyme but for the dread and horror in the lyrics, in which only the presence of a lover can distract Anni-Frid from her horror at the charade of being a pop star (one has to assume the song was written with Agnetha, who found fame extremely hard, in mind). A perfect single. MHThe peak of Abba’s disco adventures and an instant gay anthem, complete with a beguiling tension: in the throes of orce from Björn, Agnetha sings a hymn to desire and sexual freedom with lyrics by her former husband. That aside, the central riff and pulsating arrangement are deliriously great – as confirmed when Madonna nicked them both for 2005’s Hung Up. JHAnyone who ever called jealousy an ugly emotion clearly hadn’t spent enough time listening to the rapturous Lay All Your Love on Me, whose clipped, defensive verses about perceiving every woman as a potential threat give way to pure, unfiltered id: a demand for attention that sounds both luxurious and genuinely threatening. LSWriting about orce is one thing asking your ex-wife to sing it quite another. Björn would always declare The Winner Takes It All to be a work of fiction – although the song’s original working title, The Story of My Life, suggests otherwise. Whatever, the combination of uplifting pop balladry (those descending piano lines!) and despairing lyrics has been much imitated but never bettered. TJNot just Abba’s most joyous song, but arguably pop music’s itself. Dancing Queen is a hymn to youthful dancefloor euphoria that launches listeners straight into the middle of the chorus and doesn’t let up from there. It’s so perfect, in fact, that it made Frida cry on first hearing it, “out of pure happiness that I would get to sing that song”. TJWritten well before Abba’s own breakups, this 1977 No 1 is sung in the mournful words of a couple who have nothing left for one another. The gossamer chorus and pinch of kitsch gave Steve Coogan a readymade theme tune and catchphrase (“A-ha!”) for his comic character, Alan Partridge. DSA sparse, sprawling, electronic spookpop masterpiece. Fans have speculated for decades over the identity of the titular “you”, whose arrival marks a change in Agnetha’s mundane life – theories range from a new lover, to a stalker, to even suicide – but the song is about finality in more ways than one: it was the last one Abba ever recorded. Until now … PRThere’s Abba gold, and then there’s Abba platinum. The ultimate pop band’s ultimate pop song went on to inspire hits for the Sex Pistols, Girls Aloud and countless songwriters in between – including Abba, with Björn later identifying this 1975 single as fundamental in forging their musical identity. And it’s all here: the pathos and drama of intense romantic despair delivered via a peerless melody and a minor-to-major chorus explosion, a collision of sonic euphoria and lyrical gloom so potent and disorientatingly bleak that Portishead’s downbeat 2015 cover arguably cheered the song up a bit.

A company called Structured Asset Sales, which owns part of the copyright of Gaye’s song, is suing Sheeran for $100m (£76.4m), alleging that his 2014 single copies “the melody, rhythms, harmonies, drums, bass line, backing chorus, tempo, syncopation and looping” of Gaye’s 1973 hit.Structured Asset Sales was founded by the investment banker David Pullman, who in the late 1990s invited musicians to sell off their future income in exchange for money upfront. David Bowie, James Brown and the Isley Brothers were among his clients. Pullman claims to have done a deal with the son of Gaye’s late co-writer, Ed Townsend Jr, and says he owns a part of the song and therefore a stake in the litigation, reports the Hollywood Reporter. A judge rejected its initial motion for intervention on 11 June. Structured Asset Sales then filed a fresh lawsuit repeating the claim of copyright infringement.Defendants listed in the new claim include SonyATV Music Publishing, Atlantic Records and co-writer Amy Wadge.  has contacted Atlantic for comment.The suit follows another against Thinking Out Loud filed in August 2016 by the family of Townsend Jr, claiming “the melodic, harmonic and rhythmic: compositions of Thinking are substantially andor strikingly similar to the drum composition of Let’s”. The BBC reported that it was unclear whether that case had been resolved. Sheeran has segued Thinking Out Loud into Let’s Get It On in concert.Thinking Out Loud, which reached No 1 in November 2014, is not the only Sheeran work that has faced legal action over alleged similarities to other songs. In January this year two songwriters, Sean Carey and Beau Golden, filed a lawsuit accusing the singer of stealing the melody from their song When I Found You, sung by Australian artist Jasmin Rae, and using it for The Rest of Our Life, which Sheeran wrote for the country artists Faith Hill and Tim McGraw. Sheeran responded with court documents denying any similarity between the two songs. In June 2016 two more musicians, Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard, claimed Sheeran’s 2014 single Photograph had the same musical composition as their song Amazing, performed and released by the X Factor winner Matt Cardle in 2012. Sheeran settled the claim, and the terms of the deal were not disclosed. Harrington and Leonard were represented by the lawyer Richard Busch, who successfully sued Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams for copyright infringement over their single Blurred Lines in 2015, winning a $7.4m (£5.1m) settlement.The Blurred Lines case has led to many artists crediting minor resemblances in their songs in order to avoid potential lawsuits. In March 2017, two weeks after Sheeran released his third album, ÷, he added three new songwriting credits to his No 1 single Shape Of You, crediting the writing and production team behind TLC’s 1999 single No Scrubs.Taylor Swift acknowledged Right Said Fred as co-writers on her 2017 comeback single Look What You Made Me Do, which was said to resemble the British duo’s 1991 single I’m Too Sexy. In 2016, Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig described the granular process of inspiration that led to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs receiving a credit on Beyoncé’s Hold Up, a song he initially wrote with producer Diplo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dad18d4bb6c3a23df5444662a3db96af1603054/0_0_3500_2266/master/3500.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026s=32cfbbb645c8d5a6af557c3c70f7d15c","title":"wigan leeds super league match report","story":"• Wigan 46-8 Leeds• Uninspired Leeds in danger of another relegation battleBrian McDermott admitted he was concerned after Leeds endured yet another defeat. Never before had the reigning champions lost seven successive league games in the modern era, and it did not take long herefor it to become apparent the Rhinos were about to create an unwanted record.This defeat leaves them hovering above the competition’s bottom four, who will split from the rest in a month’s time to fight against relegation with the Championship’s best in the Qualifiers. In 2016 Leeds’s presence in that mini-league was shocking. To be there two years from the past three would be unthinkable.But it is perhaps the nature of this defeat to second-placed Wigan which will be most concerning. Leeds had improved of late but by half-time they were 22-4 behind after being comprehensively outplayed, and matters only got worse.Such was the nature of their performance it prompted the usually positive McDermott to tell it like it was. “I could give you some cliches and they would be true – but if you’re asking me if I’m concerned then yes, for sure,” he said.Though Leeds took the lead through Brett Ferres’s early try, by half-time two tries for Liam Marshall and another for Josh Woods – the teenage half-back who was magnificent for the home side – had established a commanding advantage which Wigan did not surrender.The Rhinos’ performance only worsened after the interval. The moment Liam Farrell strode through a huge gap in Leeds’ defence to touch down underlined the gulf between the two sides, before the Rhinos topped that by throwing two wild passes in midfield in the final moments which were picked off by Wigan players and eventually finished by Marshall and Tom Davies.There were moments of promise for Leeds, Joel Moon’s late try among them. But the champions are running out of excuses as well as time. On this form Leeds may need the sides below them to keep losing should they wish to avoid the Qualifiers this summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88d01cef71449e0b7acb41c6c4d1734e9f12f384/60_558_6974_4186/master/6974.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2ba5e1189d541c0e98e9bcbc7c236e6","title":"talking horses itv racing show at newcastle a boost for the sport horse racing tips","story":"If the programme, cleverly slotted in for the first rest day during the World Cup, is successful then expect more of the same in the schedulesOver 400,000 viewers tuned in for the first evening racing on terrestrial television for over 20 years last month when ITV broadcast the Brigadier Gerard meeting from Sandown, the first broadcast of a night card since the 1990s.If Friday night’s programme from Newcastle - cleverly slotted in for the first rest day during the World Cup - is similarly successful then expect more of the same in the schedules. ITV Racing editor Richard Willoughby has already signalled the channel’s interest in covering more night racing and the ITV4 programme at 6pm has benefited from plenty of cross-promotion with the football.Oli Bell, who is leading ITV Racing’s team at Newcastle, said: “I’m really looking forward to heading to Newcastle and leading the coverage for ITV’s first Friday night meeting. I’ve been racing a few times to Newcastle and it’s a good atmosphere with lots of the locals coming out and having a great time. It’s a really fun, lively and energetic city and this weekend of racing, building up to the prestigious Northumberland Plate on Saturday, is something they are rightly very proud of.”There are four races being televised, including a Group Three fillies’ ten-furlong event and the always competitive Gosforth Park Cup. The Group race has been enhanced from the Listed version that was run last year and all together this is an excellent evening’s sport to put before the nation.There are few evening meetings of quality throughout the year and while it’s early days, racing could definitely benefit from future collaborations with ITV on night cards of similar quality. It will be fascinating to get the viewing figures after Friday’s programme.As far as the centrepiece race of the night is concerned, Roger Varian has targeted Atletico (7.30) at the Gosforth Park Cup and he should go very well provided his low draw is not too much of an inconvenience.Newmarket trainer Luca Cumani has experienced a frustrating season but must have high hopes that Gorgeous Noora (7.55) can win the fillies’ six-furlong handicap at his local track. The form of her York third last time out has worked out well and as with most of the Italian’s runners should benefit from that run.Tips by Tony Paley"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a2da46877986069e00900cdcb5b22468a2d3a6a/0_13_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49ef5a1e5020b073f37b861e5cf2ccb1","title":"50 shows to see at the edinburgh fringe 2018","story":"Superstar standups, daring dance, Brexit cabaret and a Bon Jovi musical … Dive into our guide to some of the shows at the world’s biggest arts festivalby  Brian Logan and  Chris WiegandAs ever on the fringe, a handful of big hitters return to reconnect to their standup roots. The pick of this year’s crop – which includes Marcus Brigstocke, Nina Conti, David O’Doherty and Reg Hunter – must be Rhod Gilbert, who made his name (and narrowly missed out on a Perrier award) with his volcanically exasperated fringe shows in the mid-noughties. Now he’s back, for just a short run, performing his first live comedy in six years.The programme at Dance Base features work from 11 countries and includes the Grassmarket venue’s first full-scale ballet, Giselle by Ballet Ireland. But the eye-catcher on this year’s lineup is Sunshine Boy, Andy Howitt’s tribute to the extravagantly lipsticked Leigh Bowery – performance artist, designer, sitter for Lucian Freud, Clothes Show star and legend of London’s club world, whose signature act involved giving birth to his partner on stage.Her 2016 debut made waves, her 2017 follow-up, Sassy Best Friend, was wonderful. This time out, the high-energy, highly-strung standup Rose Matafeo tackles horniness, of all things, and – in a year when Flight of the Conchords’ return has towered over live comedy – is part of a Kiwi invasion that includes “Lorde’s favourite comedian” Paul Williams, newcomer Alice Snedden and an all-new show from the big-hitting mime act Tape Face.His 2012 show BigMouth was an arresting collision of speeches from the Greeks to George W Bush – told with a splash of Sondheim and Nirvana – that explored how words can lead to war. Now, in a new performance, Valentijn Dhaenens returns once more to deadly rhetoric and to what makes politicians tick.The title sounds like something you’d be promised amid the flyering blizzard on the Royal Mile. But the signs look good for this monologue, co-produced by Manchester’s Royal Exchange and performed by Julie Hesmondhalgh. It was written in secret for her by her husband, Ian Kershaw, and promises, she says, to offer “a bit of love and hope”.Two credits guaranteed to give your comedy career a head start are “Gaulier-trained” and “directed by Cal McCrystal”. The Boosh and Spymonkey guru helped ex-clown student and former Plague of Idiots frontman Damien Warren-Smith create this spoof theatre masterclass, which won awards at both the Adelaide and Brighton festivals. Expect Shakespeare, butoh and Pinter takedowns, and – you have been warned – hands-on audience participation.There has been no shortage of comedy treatments of the whole Brexit farrago, but this one might cut the self-styled “bad boys of Brexit” deepest, as Messrs Johnson, Farage and co get a queer-cabaret makeover. At its work-in-progress stage, the barfly of Thanet was played by the fabulous Le Gateau Chocolat – a casting dream! – while the show’s Edinburgh preview will feature powerhouse singer and comedian Jayde Adams as the foreign secretary. Richard Thomas (Jerry Springer – the Opera) writes the tunes.Styled as a disarmingly jaunty joint lecture, Michael Pinchbeck’s multimedia show revisits John Berger and photographer Jean Mohr’s account of the life of an English country GP. Grounded in Berger’s thinking about art and perspective, it asks what drives a doctor who rises at night and slips an overcoat over his pyjamas to cross fields and answer his patient’s call – and, as the NHS marks 70 years, what drives today’s overloaded medics.An Oscar-winning actor, a director and a playwright are at loggerheads while preparing a production in this world premiere by David Ireland. The warning that it is “not for the faint of heart” will be acknowledged by anyone who saw Ireland’s blistering Cyprus Avenue, which starred Stephen Rea as an Ulster loyalist who sees the face of Gerry Adams in his baby granddaughter.No pressure, Sam Campbell, but the last three winners of the Melbourne comedy festival’s Barry award have gone on to be nominated for its Edinburgh equivalent. (Two of them – Sam Simmons and Hannah Gadsby – won it.) Oddball Sydney-based comic Campbell bagged this year’s gong with his absurdist sketch show The Trough, and its Edinburgh run spearheads another strong Aussie showing (including eye-catching newcomers Ivan Aristeguieta, Laura Davis and Heidi Regan) in Edinburgh.In the opening of JG Ballard’s 1974 novel Concrete Island, the architect hero overturns his Jaguar after screeching down a high-speed exit lane. Glasgow-based performer Mele Broomes presents her full-throttle, one-woman dance version of the cult classic to a pulsating soundscape and a blizzard of projections.You can’t accuse Kiri Pritchard-McLean of bandwagon-jumping. She made her show about sexism in comedy, Hysterical Woman, long before #MeToo. Its follow-up, Appropriate Adult, made remarkably lively comedy out of her experiences mentoring vulnerable kids. But this year’s show, in which the impressive Welsh comic explores gaslighting, is undoubtedly of-the-moment.A Bon Jovi musical imagined each night with the help of the audience? Writer-performer Paul O’Donnell is making his fringe debut and may well be livin’ on a prayer but he’ll make it he swears. O’Donnell turns the story of Tommy (used to work on the docks) and Gina (works the diner all day) into a zero-budget musical epic. This late-night show might just have Edinburgh hit written all over it.It won’t come as news to anyone who saw her first two shows (think emphatic party-comedy meets self-empowerment seminar) that Luisa Omielan didn’t see herself as a political animal. That all changed when she had to usher her dying mum through a dysfunctional NHS. Her new show, Politics for Bitches (also in development for BBC3), lays that political education bare and, as you’d expect from this most democratic of comics, invites her audience to join in.A welcome return for Sh!t Theatre’s wonderfully warm 2017 fringe smash. The duo Louise Mothersole and Rebecca Biscuit recount their pilgrimage to Dolly Parton’s Tennessee theme park and their ersion to the same state’s body farm, where human decomposition is studied. En route they unravel unexpected connections between Dolly the singer and Dolly the sheep. A show about cloning, icons and iniduality, it is full of the duo’s love not just for the country star, but for each other.Sitcom regulars Anna Crilly (taciturn housekeeper Magda in Lead Balloon) and Margaret Cabourn-Smith (Miranda’s pregnant pal, Alison) team up as a double act reunited after a decade apart for one last gig. Sexism and ageism are on the agenda in a show by standup turned playwright Danielle Ward.With bobbling bobble hats, tempestuous tents and four pairs of wobbly wellies, this dance show for children aged three to five, staged by the inclusive company Indepen-dance 4, is directed by a hero of children’s theatre, Anna Newell. The autumnal colour design is a delight, as are the dancers who weave between showers of leaves.The BBC and Avalon are presenting four debut dramas at the fringe, written by former Perrier winner Frank Skinner, journalist Bim Adewunmi, Bafta-winning director Beryl Richards and the ever-excellent actor Katherine Parkinson, whose play Sitting finds three people posing for a painting in an artist’s studio years apart from each other.If you can judge a comic by the quality of her collaborators, Kate Berlant’s Edinburgh debut would be a home banker. In the US, the LA native is celebrated for her double act with Search Party star John Early, and also popped up in Reggie Watts’s Netflix special Spatial. But her solo work is just as acclaimed: the New York Times placed her “at the forefront of experimental comedy”.Jamali Maddix had no sooner established himself in live comedy when TV came calling – and the success he had hosting Viceland’s documentary Hate Thy Neighbour, about racial hatred and resurgent rightwingery, propelled him directly into the big league. This year’s fringe dates spearhead a maiden world tour for the Ilford boy, with a new show promising “more personal tales of hate and moral confrontation from his travels around the world”.Once seen, Jessie Cave’s 2015 show I Loved Her was never forgotten. A heartfelt, hyper-neurotic account of the anxieties and obsessions attendant on her life with fellow comic (and father of her child) Alfie Brown, it took oversharing to the nth degree. Now she’s back for the first time since, with another DIY solo show (“confessional comedy meets DIY performance art,” she calls it) about motherhood, Instagram and getting through a breakup.The fringe’s From Start to Finnish season includes circus, drama and a mask-theatre show about Finland’s myth of an elf that lives in the sauna. Meanwhile, the Helsinki-born choreographer Ima Iduozee performs his minimalist, shape-shifting solo This Is the Title, bringing a kind of hypnotic stillness to his B-boy stylings.Most people wouldn’t be able to name the 14 events in a tetra-decathlon, let alone compete in one. But Lauren Hendry cheerily decided to give a world championships a go despite being a self-proclaimed “serious amateur”. Her one-woman show is a 60-minute stroll through what happened, directed by Jenna Watt, who won strong reviews for Faslane in 2016.Pleasance at EICCToddlers can be the toughest theatre critics, but Starcatchers are a safe bet to keep young ones enchanted. The company’s co-production with Curious Seed, for the under-threes, invites the audience on to a nursery-style set for a closeup view of performers who make magic from the simplest of props, as they celebrate the bond between parent and child. The Mash Report host has been the go-to man for sharp political comedy for the last few years, and this year he’s back, albeit with a show billed – for its entire 24-night run – as a work-in-progress. There’s acute political humour elsewhere, too, from Ahir Shah and Ayesha Hazarika on the left, Fin Taylor antagonising everyone in the middle, and Geoff Norcott’s Toryism at the other extreme.Canadian ice-skating troupe Le Patin Libre return with their cool moves in a double bill performed in a rink that takes on epic proportions as they glide around each other, their blades cutting striking designs into the surface. Audiences watch the first part from the stands, then sit down on the ice for the second, where the gang thrillingly skate straight towards you.The Edinburgh film festival has long since shifted from August to the start of summer, but the fringe has a double dose of cult cinema courtesy of horror composer Claudio Simonetti and his band Goblin. They’re playing the intoxicatingly creepy original scores for George Romero’s Dawn of the Dead and Dario Argento’s Suspiria alongside screenings of the films.Shortlised for the Man Booker prize and the  first book award, Chigozie Obioma’s debut novel drew comparisons to both Chinua Achebe and Emile Zola. Gbolahan Obisesan’s adaptation distils the novel to focus on just two of the brothers who encounter a prophet on a fishing trip in Nigeria that spirals into tragedy.Scotland had its Colin “the British are coming!” Welland moment two years ago when an Edinburgh comedy award double-whammy, Richard Gadd and Scott Gibson, threatened a renaissance of Caledonian standup. Leading the pack of homegrown acts this year is cult TV and internet sicko Limmy, presenting the videos he made on the online platform Vine. There is also hotly tipped Christopher Macarthur-Boyd, Jay Lafferty, and a first fringe run in 25 years for Scot Squad and Absolutely star Jack Docherty.As publicity for your Edinburgh fringe run goes, winning Britain’s Got Talent can hardly be bettered. Lee Ridley, AKA Lost Voice Guy, whose cerebral palsy affects his ability to speak, performs a new show expressing scepticism of the “inspiration porn” he identifies in media depictions of disabled people. (Fellow BGT comics Robert White and Daliso Chaponda also play the fringe.)Penelope Skinner is bringing two new plays to Edinburgh this summer. Meek, which explores state control, is at the Traverse in a Headlong production, while Angry Alan is a response to both the men’s rights movement and the rise of Donald Trump. The story follows Roger, whose personal and professional life is imploding when he thinks he finds a saviour in an online activist. Skinner’s partner, Donald Sage Mackay, stars.After eccentric comedies about five-a-side (Jumpers for Goalposts) and indie bands (Broken Biscuits) comes Yorkshire playwright Tom Wells’s one-man musical about synchronised swimming and growing up gay, staged for Hull’s year as UK City of Culture in 2017. In his words, it’s about “having a go at stuff with your mates, and being 15, and wearing armbands”. It should make a splash at this popup in-the-round stage, which can really bring Edinburgh audiences together.With so many of last year’s Edinburgh award nominees not returning to compete (no Sophie Willan, no Mae Martin, no Spencer Jones), attention is bound to focus on 2017 shortlistees Mat Ewins, whose joyful DIY Indiana Jones take-off Adventureman 7 brought such uplift to Fringe 2017, and Jordan Brookes. The new show from the latter deeply destabilising presence addresses events in his personal life triggered by last year’s show.Cabaret star Le Gateau Chocolat has done Shakespeare at the Globe, performed opera at Glyndebourne and addressed his depression in an intimate fringe show, Black. This year he brings his first family show to Edinburgh. His take on The Ugly Duckling draws on his difficulties at school. “Duckie isn’t just about standing up to your bullies,” he says, “it’s about making sure that you don’t become a bully yourself.”Gary McNair has already proven himself a deft observer of both macho bravado and adolescent angst, so don’t miss his new play about a fight at the school gates. His co-writer Kieran Hurley, who had a hit with Beats, creates music-fuelled shows whose soundtracks linger long in the memory. Here, the tracks come from Glasgow group Frightened Rabbit. Elsewhere, McNair’s After the Cuts imagines a future without the NHS.After a scorching premiere in the US in 2016, Jennifer Kidwell and Scott R Sheppard’s razor-sharp and darkly comic take on race relations arrives in the UK. Two Stetson-sporting teachers deliver a lesson at a school where they don’t teach history by reading books. For a course on the American civil war, the pair ide the audience into armies and then all hell breaks loose.The documentary theatre company Lung have staged politically urgent shows exploring the Chilcot inquiry, the 1985 Bradford City fire and the campaign by single mothers in Newham, east London, against their eviction. This year, Matt Woodhead and Helen Monks (who played the teenage Caitlin Moran in Raised By Wolves) present a piece based on the inquiry into a fake plot to Islamise Birmingham schools.Whither the double act? It’s not the format it once was, but there are some fine two-piece comedy acts on the fringe, with women leading the line. Beard (Matilda Wnek and Rosa Robson) and Flo \u0026amp Joan will both be well worth a look, and there is a fringe return for Radio 4 favourites The Pin. Then there are the twisted pleasures of Norris and Parker, whose late-night offering in 2016 was a hoot. Sounds as if their new show Burn the Witch is cut from similarly macabre cloth.Nobody makes shows quite like Nick Mohammed. Performed in character as his bumptious alter ego Mr Swallow, his series of almost-solo spoof musicals (the Dracula one, the Houdini one) have been fringe highlights in recent years. In the Houdini one, you got incredible feats of escapology to boot, and the derring-do looks likely to escalate this summer, when Mohammed launches his newest spectacular on an unsuspecting world: Mr Swallow and the Vanishing Elephant.Katherina Radeva designed the 2017 Edinburgh hit Salt, in which Selina Thompson retraced the transatlantic slave triangle. Now, Redeva – who was born in communist Bulgaria – performs her one-woman show about the end of the cold war and reflects on borders past, present and future.A few years ago, they looked like the saviours of the sketch show, but Sheeps have been only an intermittent presence since. Instead, their component talents broke into TV comedy (Liam Williams’ Pls Like Al Roberts in Channel 4’s new Stath Lets Flats), producing (Williams co-runs Fight in the Dog) and theatre (Williams’ and Daran Johnson’s Ricky Whittington and his Cat). It is all the more mouthwatering then that the threesome return at this year’s fringe, with more skilful, smart and silly team comedy.Pins and Needles had a West End run with Mr Popper’s Penguins, a charming slice of Americana about a wannabe Antarctic adventurer whose home life is flipped upside down when a penguin arrives in the post. The company brings another puppet-powered, tuneful treat about an unexpected houseguest, this time based on Raymond Briggs’s book The Bear, which should be lunchtime fun.Apphia Campbell’s monologue, told with gospel and blues songs, was an awardwinner in Edinburgh in 2017 and returns for a limited run. It fuses the lives of two women: a student who fights for civil rights in the wake of Ferguson and Assata Shakur, a member of the Black Liberation Army in the 70s, who became one of the FBI’s most wanted.Cora Bissett had played only a handful of gigs with her indie band Darlingheart when, straight out of school, they landed a major record deal and found themselves on the road with Blur and Radiohead. She looks back at a three-year whirlwind of music, prompted by rereading her teenage diaries, and reflects on the future she wants for her daughter.There was once a fine (if not exactly distinguished) tradition of men playing women for comic effect. The tables have turned now, and – after Zoe Coombs Marr’s success as her sexist alter ego Dave – here comes 2017 best newcomer Natalie Palamides in character as Nate. “For the first time in history,” runs her blurb, “it’s hard to be a man” – an argument she’ll test probably to destruction in this clowning follow-up to last year’s surpassingly strange and delightful debut, Laid. Now, as then, she is directed by cult fringe favourite Dr Brown.Edinburgh resident and former Perrier award champ – back in the days when it was practically the plaything of budding Irish male standups – Dylan Moran now launches his new show Dr Cosmos at the fringe. Finally growing into the elder statesman role he’s long been fashioning for himself, Moran’s oddly wise and always off-beam commentaries on modern living will surely be one of the treats of the festival.Underbelly’s Circus Hub on the MeadowsSome of Mozart’s best known movements do just that in this new family show from the Australian company Circa, whose acrobats perform to the great composer’s music. A pair of circus performers are joined by a musician for a piece that – judging by their frequent past appearances at the festival – should hit the high notes.Disability-led performance company Birds of Paradise explore the issue of actors “cripping up” with an irreverent escapade about an am-dram society who decide to stage a musical inspired by the Daniel Day-Lewis film. Co-presented with the National Theatre of Scotland, it stars Dawn Sievewright, one of the triumphant “ladies of perpetual succour” from Vicky Featherstone’s 2015 fringe sensation.First staged before a date had been set for Ireland’s abortion referendum, Liz Roche Company’s politically urgent dance work about Irish women’s struggle for autonomy of their bodies arrives on the heels of the landslide vote to repeal the eighth amendment. It’s performed by two dancers against an abstract film and a specially commissioned poem by Elaine Feeney.His 2015 show Lance, about leaving home, losing faith and cycling, was a delight its follow-up Maestro, about classical music, was likewise Edinburgh award-nominated. After a year’s break – and now with a sitcom role in Two Doors Down under his belt – Kieran Hodgson returns with ’75, a comic storytelling solo about the first UK-in-Europe referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/216c2d8013ee98fbfbc87771a449381c55dfcbc8/332_225_1828_1097/master/1828.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=351da93de494877283e06f144da493f3","title":"michael che funniest things","story":"The American standup, actor and writer on the things that make him laugh the mostThe Miles Davis autobiography.

Launched in 2016 as tens of thousands of Syrian refugees were arriving in Canada, the Nai Kids choir has been gathering weekly in Toronto to belt out a repertoire of English and French tunes along with Syrian favourites. The choir has given its members the chance to make friends, practice their English and gain a foothold in their new home, said Fei Tang, the choir’s founder and general manager.“I think the biggest thing they get is the sense of belonging,” Tang said. “Even though the general public is very sympathetic, because of the language barriers and cultural barriers, they could not blend in that quickly. The choir serves as a buffer.”The choir has also become a refuge from constant worries over family members still in the Middle East and haunting memories of loss and destruction. Tang said: “We’re singing to give back.”So far more than 200 children have been part of the choir, including newcomers from Yemen, Eritrea and Tunisia. These days it consists of about 60 children, ranging in age from five to 15, all of whom are from Syria.They have rapidly become a homegrown hit donning their yellow polo shirts and singing about peace, love and grief for prime minister Justin Trudeau and other MPs, as well as at festivals in Toronto.But recently the choir was forced to turn down its most remarkable invitation so far: an all-expenses paid chance to perform at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC, as part of the Serenade choral festival.When the invitation arrived in October, the choir did not immediately see the potential for complications. “We didn’t think about the visa situation at first. We were panicking about ‘we’re not good enough to be presented at the Kennedy Center’.”They soon began canvassing immigration experts and other newcomers to find out how the visa process might work. Although most of the kids have lived in Canada for the past two years, Syria is among the five Muslim-majority countries targeted in Trump’s travel ban.And other Canadians from the affected countries have reported being turned away at the border and warned that they would now have issues entering the US for the rest of their lives.“The choir is very erse,” said Tang. “Some kids have been in Canada longer, some kids have fair skin, they’re blond and Christian, they probably won’t have a problem. But what if our Kurdish children or children with hijabs got stopped at the border?”The final straw was the story of a musical group who had ended up detained at the border for days after trying to cross into the US. “That’s not something we wanted to risk,” said Tang. “It’s just too much, given what these children already have been through.”Organisations across Canada have made similar decisions in the wake of Trump’s travel ban, from the Girl Guides of Canada who last year cancelled all travel to the US to the Toronto district school board.The Serenade festival – which has showcased more than 85 choirs from countries ranging from Norway to Zimbabwe in the past eight years – got under way this week, just as the US supreme court upheld the travel ban.Neeta Helms, the founder and president of Classical Movements, the organisation behind the festival, said the choir’s decision to avoid crossing the border was understandable. “We’re in kind of a difficult world right now. It’s definitely not easy to predict who will qualify for entry.”Instead of performing, the choir will appear in a prerecorded video which will be shown at Kennedy Centre during the festival’s grand finale on Sunday.The aim of the video is to reinforce to the children that politics – rather than personal feelings – are behind the decision to stay home, said Tang.“Of course you don’t talk politics to the children, but when they asked why are we doing the recording, we said that Americans love you guys, they wanted you to be there. It’s just Mr Trump doesn’t want us to be there,” she said. “So we are sending our love through our songs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a5c8be18d558251edfd7fe9e7570ab6320dcd7f/0_189_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=204eae01b1b5047d456fc4da62067e37","title":"jean marie le pen seeks family reunion at 90th birthday party","story":"French far-right leader invites daughters Marine and Marie-Caroline after years of tensionsThe French far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who turns 90 on Saturday, has decided life is too short for family fallouts.After three years of very public spats with his youngest daughter, Marine, and 20 years of not talking to the eldest, Marie-Caroline, Le Pen has decided it is time for reconciliation.To that end he has invited both to his birthday party this weekend, for which about 200 guests will gather at the patriarchal manor, the 17th-century chateau Montretout in the western suburbs of Paris.Marine Le Pen visited her father in hospital recently after he was admitted for 11 days with a severe bout of flu. Before that they had not met since she expelled him from the Front National – now renamed Rassemblement National (National Rally) – in 2016 for repeated racist comments. “I was happy she came,” Jean-Marie Le Pen told Paris Match magazine. “We had a very pleasant time. Despite our political differences, she’s still my daughter. I even found her to be beautiful. She came with her daughters, Mathilde and Jehanne, and Nolwenn, Marie-Caroline’s daughter.”He sent Marie-Caroline to the Gallic equivalent of Coventry, refusing to let her name pass his lips, after she supported his former general Bruno Mégret when he left the FN to start his own party in 1998. But despite the long silence, he said he hoped she would attend his party “with her husband and her sisters”.His middle daughter, Yann, married Samuel Maréchal, director of the FN’s youth wing, in 1993 and had three daughters herself, one of whom, Marion Maréchal, became the youngest politician ever to sit in the national assembly when she was elected as an MP in 2012 at the age of 22.Had the old patriarch had a change of heart or a sudden revelation of his own mortality while in hospital? “What do you want me to say … I’m at the age of indulgence,” he said. “I’ve a sense of time passing. I’m rowing against the current but I know it will eventually drag me towards the rapids.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cb23d1007e51d02d458ee0edf14f02007ad6c43/0_225_4652_2792/master/4652.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=821f127ab827d28654f4444d66344198","title":"us criticise ireland action modern slavery people trafficking","story":"People trafficking report highlights forced labour in Irish fishing industryIreland has been downgraded by the US State Department’s Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report for failing to do enough to tackle modern slavery.The 2018 TIP report, released on Thursday, gives Ireland a Tier 2 ranking, on a par with Indonesia and India, because of what it describes as the government’s failure to adequately protect victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation and labour abuse, and failure to convict traffickers. In highly critical findings, the report highlights forced labour in the Irish fishing industry, and the state’s prosecution of Vietnamese and Chinese men for cannabis cultivation despite indications that they were victims of modern slavery. The annual TIP report is the principal diplomatic tool used by the US to press foreign governments to act against trafficking, and Ireland’s Tier 2 ranking is highly embarrassing for an advanced economy, according to Mark Lagon, former TIP ambassador at the State Department. “It is a credit to the credibility of the US report that the US is willing to be candid about another western advanced market democracy,” he said. “We have learned that Global North nations like Ireland have permitted ungoverned and grey zones to allow human slavery in fishing to flourish. High-capacity governments must close loopholes permitting gross exploitation.” The report notes concern that the Irish government’s own immigration permit scheme for trawler crew from outside the European Economic Area is making men vulnerable to forced labour. The International Transport Workers’ Federation said the downgrade of Ireland reflected the union’s own findings that “human rights are under constant attack in the fishing sector by unscrupulous and greedy employers”. The union has begun proceedings in the high court to injunct the government’s permit scheme for facilitating modern slavery. “It is heartening that a completely independent international body has validated our findings by its decision to downgrade Ireland’s ranking,” the union said. “The continuing failure of the Irish state to enforce its own laws or heed warnings has left us with no option but to initiate legal action against the government.” A  investigation in 2015 first exposed allegations of labour abuse and trafficking for forced labour in the Irish fishing sector, prompting the Irish government to set up an emergency taskforce. The Immigrant Council of Ireland also called for urgent action from the Irish government to improve its record. Criticism from the Irish high court and from the Council of Europe have already made clear that the Irish systems for supporting victims of trafficking are inadequate, it commented.“The 2018 Trafficking in Persons report provides the most comprehensive global snapshot of the grotesque trade in people, so criticism that Ireland is not meeting minimum standards is grave news,” Nusha Yonkova, the council’s anti-trafficking expert, said.Ireland’s Department of Justice said it disagreed with the Tier 2 ranking and had taken it up with the US embassy. “A number of improvements in our systems have been made in the past year,” a spokesman said. He added that the permit scheme was introduced to meet a need in the fishing industry, and “provides a regulated process where non-EEA sea fishermen can be employed and protected in accordance with the state’s labour laws supported by the various enforcement mechanisms in place”.

For the most part that is probably because people share his exasperation with Brexit, and enjoyed his withering assessment of our former prime minister (the second “twat” is generally agreed to be glorious).But Dyer was also making a substantive argument that, having called the EU referendum and lost it, it was wrong for Cameron to resign when he should stayed on as prime minister to sort things out. Has Dyer got a point? Or is he being naive?The conventional wisdom at the time, and probably still now, is that, having called the referendum and lost, Cameron had to go. That is what happened to Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, two years earlier when he lost the independence referendum. Before the EU referendum Cameron repeatedly said that he would not resign if leave won, but I don’t think any of his colleagues, or any political journalists, believed him and at a 4am meeting in Downing Street on the night of the referendum Cameron told his close aides he would have to quit because he did not think staying on (the Dyer option) was plausible.But counterfactuals are always worth exploring, and so what would have happened if he had announced that he was going to stay on as prime minister - perhaps just to oversee Brexit and to resign once the UK was out?One of Cameron’s objections at the time was that he would have been overseeing a policy he did not believe in. But Theresa May does not believe Brexit will be good for the country either. When challenged on this, her default position is to say that this is what the country wants. And a majority of MPs are also voting through legislation that they don’t believe will be in the country’s best interests. Two years on from the referendum it has turned out (regrettably) that implementing policy without believing in it is easier than Cameron assumed.Another assumption is that Conservative MPs would have forced Cameron out anyway. But it is often forgotten that on the night of the referendum 84 pro-Brexit Tory MPs signed an open letter saying Cameron should stay on as prime minister even if leave won. (It was probably the most short-lived and unsuccessful campaign ever mounted by Conservative backbenchers.) And, remember, in the parliamentary Conservative party the pro-Brexit MPs were in a minority. A majority voted remain, like Cameron. If Cameron had tried to stay on, he would undoubtedly have been a lame duck. But MPs with leadership ambitions like serving under lame duck PMs (they have been doing it for the last year anyway), and a two or three-year extension of the Cameron premiership might have suited those who wanted to see a Brexiter succeed him before the next election.And another argument is that, if Cameron had tried to have stayed on, he would have had zero negotiating credibility with Brussels. But, looking at the current state of negotiations, does anyone really think he would have less influence with his EU partners than Theresa May?If Cameron had tried to remain as PM, we know what he would have done. He said so in the Commons on the Monday after the result. “I think it is in all our interests, whatever the eventual decision, to make sure we are as close as possible economically to our friends and partners in the European Union,” he told MPs. In this alternative reality, he would now be negotiating a very soft Brexit, Norway-style Brexit. Jacob Rees-Mogg would hate it, but the Moggites are in a minority amongst Tory MPs and a Cameron Brexit is closer to what the Commons as a whole wants than the hard Brexit May originally proposed.Could all this ever have happened? We’ll never know, and it still seems a unlikely. But thinking about it now, it seems a lot less impossible than we all thought on the morning of 24 June 2016. I think Dyer’s got a point.Ipsos MORI has published its June 2018 Political Monitor (pdf) today, with a stack of interesting polling, particularly on satisfaction with party leaders.But there is also some Brexit polling, and these figures are striking. They suggest that confidence that Theresa May will get a good deal is at its lowest since article 50 was triggered. Those not confident that May will get a good deal outnumber those who are confident about it by more than two to one.The TuskJunckerBorissov press conference is now over. There were no questions about Brexit, and only a brief mention of it in the opening statements, from Tusk. (See 2.09pm.)Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has also been holding a press conference. Here are some of the highlights. The tweets are from the Economist’s Tom Nuttall and the BBC’s Katya Adler.Asked about relations with President Trump, Juncker says he is going to Washington soon. He mentions his “friend Donald”. But he says he does not like Trump’s attempts to ide Europe.There is fresh evidence of that in the Washington Post today.Tusk says he does not want to “spoil the good atmosphere” by saying any more.The opening statements are over. Tusk, Juncker and Boyko Borissov, the Bulgarian prime minister (who is also on the panel - the Bulgarians have the presidency of the EU) are now taking questions.The first question is about the achievements of the Bulgarian presidency. Juncker says what was good about them was that they accepted the commission’s proposals.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, is speaking now.He starts by praising the job done by the Bulgarian presidency.Tusk now talks about what was agreed this morning.There was an agreement on banking and on the stability fund, he says.On Brexit, he says the EU 27 have taken note of what has been achieved so far.However, there is a great deal of work ahead and the most difficult tasks are still unresolved.He says “quick progress” is needed in order to reach a deal by the time of the October summit.This is the last call to lay the cards on the table.We are now getting the final end-of-summit press conference.He says, on migration, it is too “far too early to talk about a success”.He summarises the proposals that were agreed. (See 7.12pm.)Lord Bridges, the remain voter who was a Brexit minister until he resigned after the general election, has written an open letter to cabinet ministers in the Evening Standard urging them to unite behind a softish Brexit that would effectively seek the UK in the single market for goods. Here is an excerpt.In essence we should remain close to the EU on goods and agriculture but have independence to forge our destiny on services — which are 80 per cent of the economy.I suggest you commit the UK to remaining completely aligned to EU regulations and standards covering goods and (note) agricultural products. This — together with zero tariffs and trusted trade schemes (to deal with rules of origin) — would help minimise friction in trade. And, by covering agricultural products, you would help address the issue of the Irish border. Pledge to remain convergent on data- sharing, and recognise legal contracts and professional qualifications. Where appropriate, seek to remain party to EU agencies that underpin critical areas related to security, trade and infrastructure — such as pharmaceuticals and aviation. If necessary, remain under the European court of justice’s jurisdiction. At the summit EU leaders agreed to open membership talks with Macedonia and Albania by the end of 2019, if both Balkan aspirants show enough progress in judicial and anti-corruption reforms, Reuters reports. In a summit statement on Friday, EU leaders said they endorsed an agreement on Tuesday among the bloc’s Europe ministers to review Albania and Macedonia’s progress in June 2019 and open talks at a conference by the end of next year. While there was no debate on the issue by leaders at their two-day summit in Brussels, the statement serves to cement a compromise among EU governments to keep alive the EU membership hopes of the Western Balkan countries but seek further reforms before talks can formally start.The Maltese prime minister Joseph Muscat told journalists that EU’s conclusions on Brexit (see 11.58am) were agreed in just one minute, showing EU leaders “can still work together”, despite the lengthy row over migration. This morning was, to my knowledge, the first time the actor Danny Dyer received a mention at the regular No 10 briefing. Theresa May’s spokeswoman was asked if the PM agrees with his characterisation of Brexit, on ITV last night, as a “mad riddle” understood by no one. May does not, we were told.It was also probably the first lobby briefing where it was asked whether May believes David Cameron is “a twat” - Dyer’s vehement view on the former prime minister.“I presume that’s not sentiments the prime minister shares?” came the question. The response: “She hasn’t seen it and so I haven’t asked her about it.”Here’s a dose of reality from Emma Bonino, the former foreign minister and Italian senator, who is one of few voices in Italy who speaks in support of migrants.Speaking to the  by phone as she flipped through the pages of the Brussels migration agreement (pdf), Bonino sighed several times and said the so-called deal left one of the biggest questions unanswered: namely how NGOs might continue to operate in the Mediterranean.“I have the text in front of me. I don’t understand what they mean, frankly speaking,” she told the .The only sections of the agreement that mention rescues at sea only vaguely say that EU partners will stand by Italy. It also states that vessels should not interfere with the Libyan coastguard, whose treatment of migrants has widely been reported to violate human rights rules.Labour veteran Tony Lloyd, now shadow Northern Ireland secretary, has welcomed the decision to reconvene the British Irish intergovernmental conference on 25 July. (See 8.53am.)However while Brexit may come up at the talks, the institution is a legacy of the Good Friday agreement, and it is more likely to focus on the need to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland. Lloyd said:Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for this in a recent speech at Queen’s University Belfast, as have I during multiple engagements with the secretary of state for Northern Ireland.This highlights the growing need for the secretary of state to bring together all Northern Ireland political parties to negotiate a return to devolved government. It is simply not good enough to wait until the autumn. Northern Ireland deserves leadership not Tory inaction.Jeremy Corbyn is using one of his periodic day trips to Scotland to boost Labour’s effort to capitalise on increasing strains and pressures in the health service, by claiming the NHS as a Labour creation.Corbyn is due to visit St John’s hospital in Livingston with local MSP Neil Findlay, where the local health board controversially closed down a children’s ward last year. In an advance text, he promoted Labour plans to boost public spending by £3bn in Scotland if it wins a UK general election.“The NHS is Labour’s proudest achievement. NHS values - everybody looking after everybody else - are Labour values,” he is due to say.A series of polls putting them trailing the Tories has alarmed Labour strategists. It suggests the modest Corbyn bounce last year was shortlived, so converting public dissatisfaction with the NHS is a key strategic priority. “We want to own the NHS,” said one official.Nicola Sturgeon made that task somewhat harder by appointing Jeane Freeman, a former Labour special adviser, as her new health secretary this week. Tough and experienced, Freeman is likely to prove a stronger opponent for Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour’s health spokesman, than her predecessor Shona Robison."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Temperatures expected to hit 32 degrees in some areas on Friday as heatwave continuesLawyer says this fact should not be seen as corroborating evidence for each disputed conversationGroup says inviting Sinn F\u0026eacutein leader to celebrations would be \u0026lsquoinsult\u0026rsquo to IRA victimsFormer Anglo chief to be sentenced next month for giving unlawful loans to 10 developersCo Offaly native, who chaired planning tribunal, to be new Defence Forces ombudsmanPair made claims on impact of Minister for Health\u0026rsquos Yes stance, voter registration irregularitiesGeorge Birmingham paid tribute to former head of inquiry, Alan Mahon, on his retirementConsiderable damage done to main church doors following incident on Thursday nightGarda\u0026iacute wait to interview man who sustained shoulder injuries in early morning attackBailey lodged complaint on Garda handling of Toscan du Plantier murder investigation\u0026lsquoUnprecedented\u0026rsquo period of dry weather not yet a crisis, Minister for Agriculture saysGarda inspectorate\u0026rsquos proposals come days after force\u0026rsquos new commissioner is namedEuro zone reform and US relations lead agenda in absence of clear Brexit proposalsGarda reservists with specialist skills could also assist major criminal investigationsResidents had challenged \u0026lsquofast-track\u0026rsquo decision on development of 500 homes on pitchesIreland spends \u0026euro4,706 per head of population on healthcare, according to studyGarda\u0026iacute issue new appeal over the detective\u0026rsquos death as he is given Freedom of LimerickBloc\u0026rsquos leaders warn Theresa May of the danger of the UK crashing out of the unionMembers of the youth body are due to vote on new measures at a meeting on Saturday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548002.1530265080!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach welcomes compromise eu deal on migration","story":"An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has welcomed a late-night breakthrough in talks between the EU member states on a compromise package of migration reforms.

The summit discussions which concluded at 5am were held up by a refusal of Italy’s new Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte to sign off on any of the summit “conclusions” - which require unanimity - until he was satisfied Italy’s migration concerns were being addressed. The leaders agreed to add a recommendation on the establishment of common reception processing sites in EU front-line states as well as promising to explore the possibility of “disembarkation platforms”, centres in north Africa where rescued refugees could be directed. A somewhat perplexing declaration that asylum seekers landing in Italy will be regarded as arriving “in Europe,” was also agreed. But attempts to amend the EU’s asylum regime, the so-called Dublin regulation, which requires asylum seekers to make their applications to the member-state they first land in, were abandoned with a forlorn recommendation to the incoming Austrian presidency that they should continue to pursue a compromise.Going into this morning’s session of the summit in Brussels, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “Just want to confirm that just before 5 am last night the 28 EU member states managed to agree a compromise framework on going forward when it comes to managing illegal migration largely based on a few principles - first of all, that this is a European problem, and one that we need to work together on. “We committed to working with African countries, supporting them to build up governance, to build up security and to create economic opportunity. We’re providing over €500 million in addition - an extra €500 million - to the European trust fund for Africa,” he said. “As well as that, we took the view that at least among countries that were willing to do it, that there would be a degree of burden sharing, a transfer of migrants to countries. And Ireland has already agreed to accept some from that as well,” Mr Varadkar told reporters.French President Emmanuel Macron applauded the compromise which is seen as an important boost for the beleaguered German Chancellor Angela Merkel. “Many predicted the triumph of national solutions on migration. Tonight, we succeeded in achieving a European solution,” he tweeted.Italy’s Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Manlio Di Stefano, who is with the 5Stars, welcomed the deal:”I think it’s a really good deal and it was a long night I would say but the results are incredible. More than what was commented before,” he told the BBC’s Today programme.But Oxfam’s policy advisor on migration, Raphael Shilhav, complained that the deal was inadequate and primarily addressed external migration problems and not internal secondary flows. “EU leaders’ migration plans should have addressed the flaws of our current asylum system and provide an effective and humane response to migration, not only respond to political problems at home.”After a very short discussion following the migration debate, leaders agreed to a six-month rollover of sanctions against Russia. They also supported a plan to reshape and reduce the size of the European Parliament after Brexit.This morning they will briefly discuss Brexit and Eurozone reform."},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest recognises spectacular photos taken within the last two years, with entries in three categories: Nature, People and Cities. REIKO TAKAHASHI - National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year Contest - Mermaid I was fortunate to have encountered a humpback whale with her calf on my first day snorkeling near Japan’s Kumejima Island.

According to House of Commons Library analysis, the debt is higher because the government uses the retail price index inflation measure to calculate interest on the loans, rather than the consumer price index.In April, it emerged that graduates will face a 6.3 per cent hike in the rate applied to their loan from this autumn, due to an increase in inflation. The government dropped use of the RPI measure for uprating the value of public sector pensions in 2011, leaving workers £650 a year worse off, Labour said, but continues to use the measure to drive up student debt. “The Conservatives are rigging interest rates to ramp up costs for students. It’s not enough that they’ve saddled graduates with an average of £50,000 in debt, they’re now charging an additional £16,000 on their loans,” said Peter Dowd MP, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.“The government is cherry-picking inflation measures to maximise profits. They’ve used one measure to cut workers’ pensions and another to drive up student debt, simultaneously robbing the old and the young. They need to end this rip off and revert to the consumer price index.“The next Labour government will abolish tuition fees to ensure education is a right for all, not a privilege for a few.”UK Government to repackage student loans Budget 2017: Graduates to stop overpaying student loans Labour’s warning comes weeks after the Treasury Committee chair, Nicky Morgan, who is also a former Tory education secretary, criticised the government for its “absurd” use of the “flawed” RPI measure to calculate interest on student debt. “As RPI has been de-designated as a national statistic, the committee has urged the government to abandon its use to calculate student loan interest rates in favour of CPI,” Ms Morgan said in May. “In its response to the committee’s report, the Department for Education acknowledged the flaws of RPI, but argued that continuing its use has provided consistency over time.“Continuing to use a measure that it readily admits is flawed, on the grounds of consistency, is absurd it guarantees that student loan interest rates will be consistently flawed.”The Independent approached the government for a comment but did not get a response before publication.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Usually after brushing his teeth. Or when stopping by the bathroom, or anywhere with a mirror.He hooks an index finger into each side of his mouth and pulls gently upward. He puckers his face into a kiss, then opens wide into an O, trying to limber up his facial muscles. He practises both the Mona Lisa – slight, closed-lip – and a wide, toothy smile.At least, he’s supposed to do his exercises every day. Being 13, he sometimes forgets, though he understands their importance.“I need to stretch my cheeks,” he says. “I do it for a couple minutes. I have to do it every single day.” He exercises so much that his jaw sometimes hurts. \u0026nbspDavid and Victoria Beckham smile in \u0027amazing\u0027 family night picture How to get white teeth: Four top tips to achieve a brighter smileMan smiles before lethal injection for murder of two young daughtersKevin was born in New Jersey with a rare malignant vascular tumour, a kaposiform haemangioendothelioma, covering the left side of his face, squeezing shut his left eye and pushing his nose to the right. Immediately after his birth, doctors whisked him away to another hospital in another state – the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. His mother didn’t see him again until he was eight days old.The doctor told Kevin’s parents that the chance of him surviving was slim.\u0026nbspBut survive he did. However, the large tumour and the damage from its treatment prevented him from being able to do one of the most fundamental things humans do.\u0026nbspSmile.Most babies are born immediately able to communicate with the world around them in one way: by crying.The second signal babies send out is a smile. Newborns can smile spontaneously, as a reflex. This is sometimes misinterpreted by new parents as a reaction to their presence, a reward for their intense concern and sleepless efforts. However, it’s not until six to eight weeks of age that babies smile in a social way. Blind babies do this at the same time.That new parents sometimes optimistically interpret the first reflex smiles as meaning something more underscores the duality of smiling: there is the physical act, and then the interpretation society gives to it.\u0026nbspThe smile, and what the smile means.On a physical level, a smile is clear enough. There are 17 pairs of muscles controlling expression in the human face, plus a singular muscle, the orbicularis oris, a ring that goes entirely around the mouth.When the brain either reacts to a stimulus spontaneously or decides to form an expression intentionally, a message is sent out over the sixth and seventh cranial nerves. These branch across each side of the face from the eyebrows to the chin, connecting to a combination of muscles controlling the lips, nose, eyes and forehead.The basic upward curving smile is achieved primarily by two pairs of zygomaticus muscles, major and minor. These connect the corners of the mouth to the temples, tugging lips upward – often accompanied, depending on the underlying emotions and thoughts, by the levator labii superioris, raising the upper lip, and other muscles of the face.And as for the oft-cited folk wisdom about how it takes more muscles to frown than smile – the jury’s still out, especially as different smiles require different numbers of muscles. However, one source suggests that a genuine smile takes about as many muscles as a frown (and that a particularly insincere kind of smile might take not much more than the pair of risorius muscles).It is when we leave the realm of physiognomy, however, that the smile becomes enigmatic. This contraction of various facial muscles resonates across the entire arc of human history, from the grinning Greek kouros sculptures of 2,500 years ago right up to emoji, those little images that pepper our online communications.One study of smartphone users from 60 countries showed that emoji with smiling faces are by far the most prevalent in messages. The most popular overall – the face with tears of joy – was picked as the 2015 Word of the Year by Oxford Dictionaries. \u0026nbspJust as this emoji expresses more than mere happiness – tears adding the ironic twist so popular online – smiles themselves can convey so much more than happiness. Interpreting their nuances is a challenge whether dealing with art history or interpersonal encounters or the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.A 2016 study, published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour, questioned thousands of people in 44 cultures about sets of photographs of eight faces – four smiling, four not.In most of these cultures, people deemed the smiling faces to be more honest than the non-smiling ones. This difference was huge in some countries, such as Switzerland, Australia and the Philippines, but small in others, such as Pakistan, Russia and France. And in a few countries, such as Iran, India and Zimbabwe, there was no trustworthiness benefit to smiling at all.Why? That question is also complicated, but in essence, the researchers concluded it has to do with whether a society is set up so that its members assume that other people are dealing with them honestly. “Greater corruption levels decreased trust granted towards smiling iniduals,” the authors concluded.That attitude harks back to a very old view of smiling as being opposed to pious solemnity. There is exactly one smile in the Old Testament – Job, ironically – though in many passages faces are said to “shine”, which could mean smiling or could mean heavenly radiance.Eastern religions often use the smile to denote enlightenment. The literal name of the 1000-year-old Flower Sermon, which describes the origin of Zen Buddhism, is: “Pick up flower, subtle smile.”\u0026nbspThe Buddha and various religious figures were depicted with serene smiles, though the original Buddhist texts are as devoid of smiling as Western scripture. Jesus weeps but never smiles.Nor did Kevin Portillo, not fully. He did not smile on schedule. At five weeks old, he was already a week into chemotherapy with vincristine, an anticancer drug so powerful it can cause bone pain and skin rashes. Doctors warned his mother that the treatment might leave him blind, or deaf, or unable to walk.“If he survived,” says his mother, Silvia Portillo, in Spanish, speaking through a translator. “The doctor always said he could not give us hope that he would survive.”Whether stunted due to the tumour or killed by the chemo, Kevin’s seventh cranial nerve withered. That nerve originates at the brainstem then branches out across the face. It is susceptible not only to tumours, as in Kevin’s case, but also to rare conditions such as Moebius syndrome, a congenital facial paralysis caused by missing or stunted cranial nerves. You can’t smile, frown, or move your eyes from side to side.“You essentially have a mask on your face,” says Roland Bienvenu, 67, a Texan with Moebius syndrome.Without being able to smile, others “can get the incorrect impression of you,” says Bienvenu. “You can almost read their thoughts. They wonder, ‘Is something wrong with him? Has he had an accident?’ They question your intellectual ability, think maybe he’s got some intellectual disability since he’s got this blank look on his face.”A lopsided smile can be as problematic as no smile at all.“I have half a smile, so even with that I am able to successfully convey emotion,” writes Dawn Shawn, born with a teratoma – a fast-growing tumour that was interfering with her windpipe.“The hardest part for me was seeing photos of myself smiling, because smiling exaggerates the fact that half my face doesn’t move very much. But eventually I learned to own it. That is me. That is how I look.”The challenges stemming from lack of a smile are frequently compounded. When people have a medical condition severe enough to keep them from smiling, other difficulties tend to be involved.“He was different than the other kids,” says Silvia of her son. “He was fed for four years through the G-tube in his stomach. He wasn’t able to have a normal life, because every few hours he had to be connected to the machine to be fed.” Little kids, being curious, would look and ask what happened to him, she says.While those who cannot smile can blame the state of their facial nerves and muscles, those who can smile are often concerned with a different aspect of physiognomy: their teeth. More than $3bn is spent worldwide on teeth-whitening products, with billions more spent on braces and on purely cosmetic dentistry: straightening crooked teeth, for instance, or reducing the amount of gum that shows when a person smiles.Caring for the state of your teeth is not a modern concern. The Romans had dentists and used chewing sticks and toothpaste. They preferred dazzling white smiles, sometimes rinsing their teeth in urine to enhance the effect.Contrary to common modern perceptions, the ancients had surprisingly good teeth, for reasons that have nothing to do with dentistry. A CAT scan of 30 adult bodies recovered at Pompeii found they had “perfect teeth”.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.This was due to two factors: short lifes – they didn’t live long enough for their teeth to go bad – and, most importantly, lack of access to refined sugar, that great destroyer of dental health.When piety was an overarching value, smiles were, well, frowned upon as the precursor of laughter, which was held in true disdain. Prior to the French Revolution, broad smiles in art were overwhelmingly the realm of the lewd, the drunk and the boisterous lower classes.“The whole face ought to reflect an air of seriousness and wisdom,” John Baptist de La Salle wrote in his 1703 The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility, allowing that people might, under certain circumstances, convey the impression that they are happy, provided it is done within limits.“There are some people who raise their upper lip so high or let the lower lip sag so much that their teeth are almost entirely visible. This is entirely contrary to decorum, which forbids you to allow your teeth to be uncovered, for nature gave us lips to conceal them…”In The Smile Revolution in Eighteenth Century Paris, Colin Jones argues that smiling reflected the gathering sense of inidual worth that went along with the beheading of kings:This shift in social practices and in sensibilities involved the emergence of the perception, common in our own day, that the smile offered a key to inidual identity. In late eighteenth-century Paris, the smile came to be viewed as symbol of an inidual’s innermost and most authentic self. In a way that was perceived as both novel and modern, it was held to reveal the character of the person within.Photography, by capturing smiles, eventually helped popularise them. But the sitters in 19th-century photographs still rarely smiled, a neutral continence being both easier to hold over the long exposure necessary at the time and less likely to detract from the gravity of the occasion.“A photograph is a most important document, and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity than a silly, foolish smile caught and fixed forever,” humorist Mark Twain was quoted as remarking in the 1913 memoir of an acquaintance.Around the same time, however, Kodak in the US launched extensive advertising campaigns to help consumers see photography as a means of recording joyous events and celebrations.Over the century, smiles showed a confidence in keeping with the rise of modern capitalism. “An insincere grin? That doesn’t fool anybody,” Dale Carnegie wrote in his 1936 bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People, embraced as a life guide by millions.“We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.”Part of the attractiveness of smiles is they are so easily extended. Part of their menace is that they can also be just as easily withheld.“For a salesman, there’s no rock bottom to the life,” Charlie says at the end of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. “He don’t put a bolt to a nut, he don’t tell you the law or give you medicine. He’s a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smiling back – that’s an earthquake.”Once Kevin was able to eat food, go to school and enjoy usual childhood pastimes – he became passionate about soccer and playing the drums – he still felt the tremors of having a half-smile in a world solidly established upon “a cultural expectation of pearly perfection”, as Richard Barnett writes in his book The Smile Stealers.“I couldn’t smile on my left, I only smiled on my right,” says Kevin. “My smile was weird … people kept asking what happened to me, why I\u0027m like this. I keep telling them I was like this when I was born.”If you see someone in a wheelchair, you anticipate that the person might have trouble walking and assume a physical condition is involved. But facial paralysis carries no telltale equipment, and is rare enough that the unaffected population is not generally familiar with the conditions that cause it, whether congenital or appearing later in life.One of the latter is Bell’s palsy, an inflammation of the sheathing around the facial nerves on one side that paralyses half the face, causing the eye and corner of the mouth to droop. It usually strikes men and women between the ages of 15 and 60.In most cases temporary, Bell’s palsy generally slowly goes away as mysteriously as it arrives. Doctors suspect it is caused by a viral infection. There are also traumatic events – car wrecks, sporting accidents – that damage nerves and muscles in the face, plus congenital irregularities such as cleft palate.A common condition that can also affect the smile is stroke. A sagging smile or face drooped on one side is one of three signs that a person has had a stroke and needs immediate emergency care (the other two are weakness or numbness in one arm, and slurred or garbled speech).While losing a smile is a serious blow at any age, it can have a particular impact on younger people, who are starting out, forming the bonds that will carry them through the rest of their lives.\u0026nbspOr trying to.“It’s a huge problem,” says Tami Konieczny, supervisor of occupational therapy at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHoP). “When you look at somebody, the first thing you see is their face, their ability to smile or not smile, or an asymmetrical smile. It’s your social world.“If someone can’t read your facial expressions, then it’s difficult to be socially accepted. It’s hugely devastating for kids. I had kids photoshopping their pictures. They are taking mirror images of their good side and copying it, photoshopping their own pictures before posting them to social media.”Photoshopping might work on Facebook. But fixing a smile bisected by nerve damage and subsequent muscle loss – Kevin couldn’t move the muscles on the left side of his face, so they atrophied – is far more complicated. Sometimes, it requires multi-stage plastic surgery spread out over a year or more.There are two major procedures available for facial reanimation, according to Phuong Nguyen, a plastic surgeon and reconstructive surgeon at CHoP.The newest, which has its roots in older techniques, is called a lengthening temporalis myoplasty – taking part of the broad band of muscle that powers the jaws and repurposing it to draw up the lips.That wasn’t ideal for Kevin because he had one side of his face working. The older, more complicated surgery was better suited to him.“Kevin had the most commonly done one, a classic two-stage cross-face nerve graft followed by a free gracilis muscle transfer,” says Nguyen. “To be perfectly honest, when Kevin had his stage, we weren’t familiar with the lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedure yet.”Nguyen later learned the new procedure from facial reanimation pioneer Ronald Zuker, a Canadian plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and from its originator, French surgeon Daniel Labbé.“My preference is to do it when kids are five years of age,” says Zuker. “At the time, if I can restore a smile for them, they can go to primary school, meet kids on the playground, meet kids in class. They have their smiles and are well-equipped to handle that situation.”Why put children through what is still elective surgery?“It’s incredibly important to be able to interact with humans on a face-to-face basis,” says Zuker. “If you don’t have the ability to smile, you are at a disadvantage. People cannot understand your inner emotions. They mistake your appearance for being disinterested, or not too bright, or not very involved in the conversation.”Still, some parents prefer to wait until their children are older and can participate in the decision.“If families want to wait, that’s perfectly fine,” says Zuker. “Sometimes when a kid is nine or 10 they look in the mirror and say, ‘You know, I really want this surgery.’ That’s the time to do it.”Which is what happened with Kevin. He was doing well, “even with that scar on his face, has always been popular at school,” says his mother. “He’s always been a happy kid.”But there were kids that made fun of him, she says. One day when he was about nine, he was sad. “I said, ‘What happened to you?’ He said, ‘Some kids, they’re not my friends. They laugh at me because I look funny.’ It was really hard for us as parents.”“We always wanted the surgery,” she says. “But we were told it was impossible. We had to wait to see how everything was changing.”At age 10, Kevin told his parents that he wanted to do what most people do without giving it a second thought. He knew it would be a long, painful, difficult procedure, but it was one he wanted to undergo.“He’s very engaging, very motivated,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his occupational therapist at CHoP. “His goal, I wrote in my notes, was to have a symmetrical smile.”As with smiles themselves, so the scientific study of smiles reflects the cleavage between the physical and the interpretive. The physical side is entwined with the long history of plastic surgery, which has tended to focus on survivors of diseases like syphilis and of the knives of vengeful authorities and warlords.The father of modern plastic surgery, Harold Gillies, reported in 1934 that restoring the ability to smile made patients’ faces “feel much more comfortable”. In addition, Gillies observed, “the psychological effect is also one of considerable value”.On the interpretive side, Charles Darwin discusses the meaning and value of smiles in his 1872 landmark The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Like many, Darwin sees a smile as the first part of a continuum.“A smile, therefore, may be said to be the first stage in the development of a laugh,” \u0026nbsphe writes, then reverses course, musing that perhaps the smile is instead the remnant of laughter.He observes his own infants closely, detecting in two their first smiles at six weeks, and earlier in the third. He comments how smiles do more than merely convey happiness, mentioning the “derisive or sardonic smile” and the “unnatural or false smile”, and showing photos to see if his associates can read what they mean.The scientific study of smiles finds differences in gender (generally, women smile more) and culture. Smiles are definitely communicative – people smile more when in public than they do when alone, and more when interacting with others than when not.Scientists have shown that smiles are far easier to recognise than other expressions. What they don’t know is why.“We can do really well recognising smiles,” says Aleix Martinez, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University and founder of its Computational Biology and Cognitive Science Lab.“Why is that true? Nobody can answer that right now. We don’t know. We really do not know. We have a classical experiment, where we showed images of facial expressions to people, but we showed them very rapidly… 10 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds.“People can detect a smile even in exposures smaller than 10 milliseconds. I can show you an image for just 10 milliseconds and you can tell me it’s a smile. It does not work with any other expression.”Fear takes an exposure time of 250 milliseconds to recognise – 25 times as long as a smile, “which makes absolutely no sense, evolutionarily speaking,” Martinez says. “Recognising fear is fundamental to survival, while a smile… But that’s how we are wired.”Studies have shown that smiling faces are judged as more familiar than neutral ones. And it’s not just us that can recognise smiles more easily. “This is true both for humans and for machines,” says Martinez. Alibaba, China’s answer to Amazon, launched its new facial recognition payment system called “Smile to Pay” in September 2017.Although scientists have been studying smiles for about 150 years, they are still at the stage of trying to count and categorise types of smile among the millions of possible facial expressions.“One of the fundamental questions in the scientific literature right now is how many facial expressions do we actually produce?” says Martinez. “Nobody knows.”Scientists such as Martinez theorise that smiles – as well as frowns and other facial expressions – are remnants of humanity’s distant pre-linguistic heritage. Human language started developing as far back as 100,000 years ago, but our expressions reach back further still, even to before our origins as human beings.“Before we could communicate verbally, we had to communicate with our faces,” Martinez says. “Which brings us to a very interesting, very fundamental question in science: where does language come from? Language is not fossilised, not found in any other living species. How could something that complex have evolved from nothingness?”One of the hypotheses is that it evolved through facial expression of emotion, he says. “First we learned to move our facial muscles – ‘I’m happy. I feel positive with you! I’m angry. I feel disgust.’ Then language came through a grammaticalisation of facial expressions, which over time evolved into what we call grammar and language.”In October 2015, Nguyen, who plays in a band, cranked up some rock music in the operating room at CHoP – he thinks it was probably something from the Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream.He began work by removing a section of sural nerve from Kevin’s right ankle and attaching it to the working right side of his face, running it underneath his upper lip, to the paralysed left.“We bring it across, parking it, waiting for nerves to regrow from the right side to the left,” Nguyen says.That growth took almost a year. The nerve fibres advanced about a millimetre a day (about 24,000 times slower than a snail).In nerve grafts like this, many of the fibres don’t make it across. This means that the nerve can lose the ability to transmit information – in a few cases, completely.“The thing with nerve-based surgery, you don’t get a lot of instant gratification or feedback,” says Nguyen. “You do the procedure and don’t know if it works or not. You have to wait.”During that time, doctors would periodically tap areas of Kevin’s cheek, to see if the nerve was taking. “When it tingles, you know the nerve is growing,” says Nguyen.The body has a way of covering losses. Removing that nerve did cause a small patch of skin on Kevin’s ankle to go numb. But as he was still growing, the numb patch began to shrink as the neural network took over its function.Once Nguyen was certain the nerve was in place and functioning, it was time for the second stage of the surgery.The mystery of Mona Lisa\u0027s smile has finally been solved Mona Lisa smile \u0027based on his gay lover\u0027, art historian claimsRussian Mona Lisa could be genuineSecrets of the Mona Lisa, BBC2, TV review: the face behind the paintOne morning in August 2016, he took a purple marker and wrote a “P” on Kevin’s left temple and an “NP” on his right, for “paralysed” and “not paralysed”, a common surgical precaution against the risk of cutting into the wrong side of a patient – easier than you might imagine, considering how much of a patient’s body is draped before surgery.“It happens,” says Nguyen. “You want to make it idiot-proof.” \u0026nbspHe also drew a pair of parallel lines, marking the location of a prime artery, and an arrow: the vector Kevin’s smile would take.The surgeon made an incision from the temporal hair line, in front of Kevin’s left ear, then pivoting back under and behind it, extending into his neck – the standard location for hiding plastic surgery scars. The skin on a face peels back easily. He attached three sutures to the inside corner of Kevin’s mouth and gently pulled, to gauge exactly where the muscle should be attached.“So you know it’s in the right place,” explains Nguyen. “If you don’t get this right, they’re going to have to live with it for the rest of their life.”The moment Nguyen put strain on the triple surgical thread was the first time Kevin Portillo ever smiled on the left side of his face.That done, Nguyen removed a 12-centimetre segment of gracilis muscle, along with a section of artery and vein, from the inside of Kevin’s left thigh, as well as the obturator nerve. The muscle was secured in place by a customised splint that hooked into Kevin’s mouth and was sewn to the side of his head to keep the relocated muscle from pulling out before it healed.The section was taken from Kevin’s thigh because the powerful upper leg is rich in muscles. “There are so many muscles that do the same function… you don’t miss this,” Nguyen says.Well… most wouldn’t miss it. Kevin, a diehard young soccer fan, did. “When the surgery came I couldn’t play,” he says. “I didn’t know it would take that long. I thought it would take a couple days and I would be back.”Just how long was he sidelined?“It was more than two weeks,” he says, sorrowfully.“He wasn’t concerned with how serious the surgery was,” his mother says, laughing. “He was more concerned with not being able to play soccer.”Over the next year, Kevin began to get motion on the left side of his mouth.“It’s really kind of a magical thing,” says Nguyen. “We do this procedure, a number of hours and effort, using not a small amount of resources. We don’t know if it works or not.“I saw him post-operatively within the first couple of weeks, he looked like he had this big bulgy thing in his cheek. Nothing was moving. All of a sudden, he was smiling. It was a really incredible moment.”Well, it’s magical, but it’s also hard work. Low-tech and high-tech.\u0026nbspKevin begins his regular occupational therapy session by holding a two-cent white plastic fork in his mouth and showing that he can move it up and down.“Try to purse your lips together to make it stand up,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his therapist at CHoP. “We’ve got it pretty solid in the middle. Try to work it over to the weaker side. Nice try… and that’s harder.”Kevin puts on purple latex gloves and pulls at the inside of his cheek.“You’re going to do your stretch on the inside,” says Field. “A nice, slow hold. Good. Bring that thumb up… Do you feel like it’s getting looser than it was?”“Mmm-hmmm,” Kevin agrees, gloved fingers in mouth.She takes some photos. There is a lot of photography in facial therapy, to track progress.“Now give me the biggest open-mouthed smile you can,” says Field. “Good. Can you make the left side go up even more? Try to make your gums even.”Then, after more exercises, she asks if he is ready for the computer work.They move into the next room, to a $20,000 Lenovo biometric therapy system. Field sticks a surface EMG – an oblong black sensor that reads electrical activity in the muscle – to Kevin’s left cheek and he plays a video game, Load Ship, where he moves animated boxes from a conveyor on the screen by smiling and relaxing.“Give me a big smile,” Field says, calibrating the device. “And relax.”He plays for four minutes, the game burbling a skittery kind of jazzy electronic music.They play a few other games: one trying to get a man to a safe spot as two serrated blue spaces come together. Then a marble maze.“How are you feeling?” she asks.“Hurts,” he replies.Physical rehabilitation is the part of the surgical process that often gets overlooked, but it can make the difference between success and failure.“It’s huge, particularly with facial palsy,” says Nguyen. “You can do technically very sound surgery on two completely different patients and have two completely different outcomes based on how involved they are with their own therapy… It just doesn’t look as good.”How does Kevin feel about being able to fully smile after a lifetime of not being able to?“I’ve been getting better on how I react. I do it automatically,” says Kevin. “Sometimes when somebody says a joke. It actually feels great now. Before it felt weird to not smile. Smiling with both sides of my mouth at same time, I feel I’m one of the other people who smiles right.”His mother remembers the moment she noticed.“We were at the table, we were eating,” says Silvia. “And then we said, ‘Kevin, are you moving there?’ He started moving. Not the way he was doing today little movements.”“We were eating,” he says. “I think she said something funny, and I just smiled.”And how does smiling affect his life?“Before, I was actually shy,” he says. “Right now, I’m less shy, more active.”“I used to have trouble expressing my emotions. Now people know if I’m smiling or laughing. When I laughed, before, I laughed weird. And right now, they know, bit by bit, that I was trying to smile, I was expressing my laughter and my smile. When I play soccer, and score a goal, I’m happy. I’m smiling, to tell everybody I scored.”You’d be forgiven for thinking that classifying and counting the different types of smile would be straightforward. It’s anything but.In the mid 19th century, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne wanted to distinguish real smiles from fake. Interested in the response of nerves and muscles to stimulation, he applied electricity to particular parts of faces to see the results.He ided smiles into two groups: those that involved the crinkling of the eyes – sincere smiles – and those that used only the muscles around the mouth – insincere smiles.Today, the full smile that uses the muscles around the mouth and eyes is known as a “Duchenne smile” – and the fake one is the “Pan Am smile”, after the kind of smile you might greet someone with if it’s part of your job to be friendly.In 1974, Leonard Rubin described three basic types of smile, based on his study of 100 people:The “Mona Lisa”, where the corners of the mouth go up and outwards and the upper teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the zygomaticus major. About two-thirds of people studied smile this wayThe “canine” smile, where the canine teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the levator labii superioris. 31 per cent of people smiled like thisThe “full dentured”, where the lips are pulled back strongly, showing both upper and lower rows of teeth. All muscles are equally dominant. Just 2 per cent of people were found to smile this wayCosmetic surgeons, who have to be meticulous in identifying the smiles that their patients are paying good money to try to achieve, call these three types commissure, cuspid and complex, respectively.Phuong Nguyen, a Philadelphia plastic and reconstructive surgeon, attempts to clarify the matter using celebrities. The Mona Lisa, he says, is the Angelina Jolie. The Tom Cruise smile is a canine smile, and a Julia Roberts is the full dentured smile. This is a subjective matter. Other doctors place Jolie in the second or third categories.Smiling is not a realm given over to easy description. Contemplate the ideal smile as recounted by one clinician in the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics:An optimal smile is characterised by an upper lip that reaches the gingival margins, with an upward or straight curvature between the philtrum and commissures an upper incisal line coincident with the border of the lower lip minimal or no lateral negative space a commissural line and occlusal frontal plane parallel to the pupillary line and harmoniously integrated dental and gingival components.The total number of different types of smile is frequently debated. A recent BBC article gave the total as 19.Arguably the most important researcher into smiles over the past 30 years has been Paul Ekman at the University of California. His 1978 Facial Action Coding System, written with Wallace V Friesen, seeks to create an atlas of nearly all possible human expressions. Ekman says, in his book Telling Lies, that their technique for measuring the face can distinguish over 50 different smiles.Confused? You’re not the only one.

I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

According to House of Commons Library analysis, the debt is higher because the government uses the retail price index inflation measure to calculate interest on the loans, rather than the consumer price index.In April, it emerged that graduates will face a 6.3 per cent hike in the rate applied to their loan from this autumn, due to an increase in inflation. The government dropped use of the RPI measure for uprating the value of public sector pensions in 2011, leaving workers £650 a year worse off, Labour said, but continues to use the measure to drive up student debt. “The Conservatives are rigging interest rates to ramp up costs for students. It’s not enough that they’ve saddled graduates with an average of £50,000 in debt, they’re now charging an additional £16,000 on their loans,” said Peter Dowd MP, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.“The government is cherry-picking inflation measures to maximise profits. They’ve used one measure to cut workers’ pensions and another to drive up student debt, simultaneously robbing the old and the young. They need to end this rip off and revert to the consumer price index.“The next Labour government will abolish tuition fees to ensure education is a right for all, not a privilege for a few.”UK Government to repackage student loans Budget 2017: Graduates to stop overpaying student loans Labour’s warning comes weeks after the Treasury Committee chair, Nicky Morgan, who is also a former Tory education secretary, criticised the government for its “absurd” use of the “flawed” RPI measure to calculate interest on student debt. “As RPI has been de-designated as a national statistic, the committee has urged the government to abandon its use to calculate student loan interest rates in favour of CPI,” Ms Morgan said in May. “In its response to the committee’s report, the Department for Education acknowledged the flaws of RPI, but argued that continuing its use has provided consistency over time.“Continuing to use a measure that it readily admits is flawed, on the grounds of consistency, is absurd it guarantees that student loan interest rates will be consistently flawed.”The Independent approached the government for a comment but did not get a response before publication.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Northern Ireland\u0026nbspas\u0026nbsptemperatures were forecast to remain high over the weekend.Britain saw the record for the hottest temperature of the year broken for the fourth-consecutive day on Thursday, as the mercury reached 33C (91.4F) in Porthmadog, Wales.Forecasters expect the heatwave to continue on Saturday and Sunday, when north-west England, north-east Wales, western Scotland and possibly Northern Ireland could hit around 30C.However, the conditions have left water companies concerned, with some warning potential supply problems could be around the corner after “significantly more” usage than normal in recent days.Northern Ireland will introduce a hosepipe ban from the weekend to avoid any interruptions in service.NI Water chief executive, Sara Venning, said the company was appealing to customers to stop non-essential use, as hoses and sprinklers were causing strain on supplies.“In recent days our treatment works have been operating at near maximum levels with over 700 million litres of water being put into the network, which is some 25 per cent more than is normal for this time of the year,” she said.“Despite these steps, demand continues to outstrip supply.“It would be our intention to introduce a formal hosepipe ban in an effort to protect the public against the increased threat of supply interruptions.”Huge spikes in demand for water at mornings and evening peak times mean utility companies are having to pump billions more litres of water into the system, but they say it is often being used by customers as fast as it is supplied.UK weather:

He added that “time is very short” and said UK negotiators should return to Brussels on Monday to intensify talks.The EU says a deal must be struck before October to stop Britain crashing out of the bloc in March without a transition period – a scenario which would be expected to cause economic chaos.Theresa May on Thursday night addressed leaders over dinner about Brexit for 10 minutes but her speech was apparently overshadowed by hours of discussions about the EU migration crisis, the main focus of the summit.\u0026nbspAsked about Ms May’s dinner speech on Friday morning, Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, looked confused, and said: “There was a speech? Haha.”The joint statement signed off by the leaders on Friday, which was leaked to The Independent in advance, said coming to a deal “requires further clarity as well as realistic and workable proposals from the UK”.“The European Council expresses its concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for IrelandNorthern Ireland,” it says.“It recalls the commitments undertaken by the UK in this respect in December 2017 and March 2018, and insists on the need for intensified efforts so that the Withdrawal Agreement, including its provisions on transition, can be concluded as soon as possible in order to come into effect on the date of withdrawal.\u0026nbsp“It recalls that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.”Varadkar criticises government for not planning for Brexit before EU referendumThe motion says that the Council urges “member states, Union institutions and all stakeholders to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes” – diplomatic reference to a ‘no deal’ scenario.\u0026nbspThe main sticking point in talks is how to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The UK has flat-out rejected EU plans to give a special status to Northern Ireland that would effectively keep it in the customs union and single market, and says any deal must apply to the whole UK and be time limited. The EU says UK plans so far are not enough to prevent a hard border from happening.The UK also wants to time-limit the policy to placate Brexiteers who fear it could be used to keep Britain in the single market indefinitely, but the EU says it would not accept this.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

He called all this on, where is he? In Europe, in Nice, with his trotters up, where is the geezer? I think he should be held to account for it.”Mr Corbyn, who insisted he voted to remain in the EU, later managed to contribute to the debate by saying: “The government who is meant to be negotiating spends its time negotiating with itself.

NHS warning as cases of BLOODSUCKING flies which cause BLISTERS RISE                Hot weather means an insect plague for ScotsI was bitten twice at Broomhill in Muddiford and five times where I live in Ilfracombe.Another woman bitten at her yard in nearby Buckfastleigh warned: \u0026ldquoThey seem really bad this year even fly sprays aren\u0027t keeping them away.Reports have also come in from Humberside, Kent, Merseyside and Cambridgeshire about the imminent onset of horsefly biting spree.As with many insects, it is the female horsefly that proves far more dangerous than the male. She needs to feast on blood \u0026ndash usually from equines or deer \u0026ndash in order to bring her into reproductive mode.Bare human flesh is an easy target.In the recent pest controllers\u0026rsquo report, it is easy to see why horseflies are such a menace in summer.MENAround the country reports are coming in of the inch-long flies homing in on the bare legs and armsIt states: \u0026ldquoLiterally designed to eat a horse, the horsefly bite is both impressive and painful.\u0026ldquoThe horsefly is a sanguivorous insect and therefore wants to bite you.\u0026ldquoThey can persistently chase you at a flying speed of around 15 mph, and it\u0026rsquoll bite right through clothes.\u0026ldquoOur Technical Manager, Dee Ward-Thompson, has been bitten by a horsefly.\u0026ldquoShe affectionately described the bite as \u0026lsquoa sharp sting followed by tingly feeling (not the nice kind) then extreme pain\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoThe horsefly has mandibles that can rip and tear flesh apart.MENThe NHS warns victims that horsefly bites can be very painfulInsect pest management company Sentomol describes in detail why horseflies are so annoying.It states: \u0026ldquoThe bite from horseflies can be quite painful, especially considering the light, agile, and airborne nature of the fly.\u0026ldquoUnlike insects which surreptitiously puncture the skin with needle-like organs, female horseflies have specially adapted mouthparts which they use to rip andor slice flesh apart.\u0026ldquoThis causes the blood to seep out as the horsefly licks it up.\u0026ldquoThe horsefly is secretive, with an annoying ability to land without being detected and escaping before the victim begins to experience any pain.\u0026ldquoThe subsequent bite can be extremely irritating.\u0026ldquoThe horsefly\u0026rsquos bite is considered more immediately painful than that of a mosquito.\u0026ldquoHowever, the pain of a horse fly bite may mean that the victim is more concerned with assessing the wound and not swatting the culprit.The National Health Service warns victims that horsefly bites can be very painful and leave the bitten area of skin red and raised.Other symptoms include a rash, dizziness, weakness and wheezing.The NHS warns: \u0026ldquoHorsefly bites can take a while to heal and can become infected.\u0026ldquoSee your GP if you have symptoms of an infection, such as pus or increasing pain, redness and swelling."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/183x122/980744_1.jpg","title":"brexit news bbc question time eu exeter clive lewis","story":"The flagship show was filmed in Exeter and the question posed to the panel was whether the UK is heading towards a no deal Brexit because of isions within the Government.Clive Lewis claimed Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell had offered to help Theresa May negotiate Brexit but their offer was rejected.The Labour MP also refused to answer David Dimbleby whether he advocated a second EU referendum.An incensed audience member asked Mr Lewis: \u0026ldquoWhy doesn\u0026rsquot Labour and the Conservatives get their heads together and work together?

Definitely, a real connection.”Who, of course, apart from Adam, who was going to be trouble from the moment he introduced himself as: “Not the serious man you see on Instagram.”A personal trainer unencumbered then by the flab of self-doubt who’s got a hint of the Blutos about him and flags up the moments he’s about to be cocky by ­saying: “Not being cocky but . . .”You can’t argue with the female ­reaction, though. Kendall, Megan, Rosie and Zara have all fallen for the swaggering great berk and Adam’s dumped all but the last of them with a smirk of self-satisfaction.As a way of endearing yourself to the core audience, it’s not good. As reality TV baddies go, however, he’s gold.It was inevitable then, I suppose, the fun police would also start taking an interest in him.Sure enough, there they were above the caption “Is Adam’s behaviour unacceptable?” on Thursday’s This Morning, where Katie Ghose, from Women’s Aid — who you’d hope had better stuff to do — was claiming: “Adam’s behaviour is a form of emotional abuse.”It didn’t take a genius to make the obvious point here. It took Towie’s Lauren Goodger, who said: “It’s just a TV show” and Adam’s merely taken the ­multiple dating rules at face value.So, if you have a genuine moral objection, take it up with ITV rather than feeding their publicity machine.Personally, I don’t. I have, though, had a nagging sense something was missing from this year’s run and it wasn’t until last week I worked out what it was either. The opposition.Big Brother, which is normally, head-to-head with Love Island, has disappeared and, I can almost guarantee, none of you have noticed or regretted its absence either.So not only has Love Island been funny, entertaining, immune to political correctness and proved a point, it’s removed the pox of Big Brother in the process.And if that isn’t public service broadcasting of the highest order and worthy of a plug, I dunno what is, frankly.The BBC failing to put Mark Lawrenson out of his obvious misery. Gary Lineker using apparently random World Cup trivia to draw attention to his goal-scoring exploits.The main BBC News actually doorstepping Lord Sugar over one stupid bladdy Tweet.This Morning’s Russell Grant spraying his astrological BS all over Love Island with the claim: “Rosie gave way to Adam too quickly ’cos of Mars in Venus and Venus and Leo.”And host Phillip Schofield failing to deliver the very obvious response: “Your head in Uranus.” TIME was, BBC comedy would make fun of Rick from The Young Ones, and all his ridiculous right-on pretensions.These days he’s running the show, in the guise of a man called Shane Allen who, not withstanding a thousand layers of state bureaucracy, has the easiest mission statement in television – make the viewers laugh.Apparently not, though. According to Shane, running BBC comedy these days is about finding “the diversity story”.Which sounds a bit like awarding the World Cup trophy to Switzerland, on the grounds of the squad’s ethnic mix.Except he doesn’t really mean diversity. It’s just those groups the BBC likes that Shane wants to employ, having made it abundantly clear “Oxbridge white blokes”, who’ve punched well above their weight, historically, are no longer required.So, at a stroke, you deny yourself any chance of finding talents and shows as brilliant, era-defining and clever as Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G/Borat), Pete and Dud, Python, Fawlty Towers, Jimmy Carr, Fry \u0026amp Laurie, The Goodies and Not The Nine O’Clock News, while still very much lumbering us with the likes of Mel \u0026amp Sue, Famalam and Tittybangbang.For the privilege of institutionalising this failure and replacing an imagined prejudice with a very real one, I’ve also just learned we pay the BBC’s Head of Comedy £208,000 a year.Laugh?I didn’t.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “What South American country comes first alphabetically?”Mark: “Zimbabwe.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “Beginning with the letter J, what word means liquid extracted from fruit?”Carroll: “Glucose.”Andrew O’Keefe: “What sedimentary rock is an anagram of the word leash?”Karen: “Coal.”And Andrew O’Keefe: “Which wig-shaped New York building was ­constructed in 1902?”Hat: “Trump Tower.”No, but I like the way you’re thinking, Hat.NEXT up from BBC2’s department of really dumb ideas?You take two of the greatest and most original comic talents of the last 30 years, Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse.And send them bloody fishing.A combination which, in terms of things I don’t want to watch, is right up there with Vic Reeves \u0026amp Harry Enfield restoring vintage cars and Mel \u0026amp Sue attempting stand-up comedy.Mind you, the point of Gone Fishing also seemed lost on Bob Mortimer, as he trudged off to a Norfolk lake, angling for tench and asking his new mate: “What do we hope to achieve by the end of this, Paul?”Long pause.“A bit of inner peace?”What’s in it for the viewers became less and less clear as the silent pauses became longer.To the extent that, if you were lucky, Gone Fishing may just have been television to fall asleep to.If you weren’t, the last thing you may ever have heard was Bob asking: “Anything, Paul?”“No. Nothing.”On the plus side, though, corpses will have missed the moment where the BBC suddenly abandoned the fishing trip and, genuinely (I’m not making this bit up) sent Bob and Paul to a local micro-brewery.The resulting p***-up, you might not be wholly surprised to learn, wasn’t particularly well organised.Lee Dixon: “It’s a must-win game and Germany need at least a draw.”Phil Neville: “Mexico thoroughly deserve their 1-0 victory at half time.”Pablo Zabaleta: “At 3-1 down Tunisia need a goal to equalise the game.”Jason Mohammad: “One of the impressive things about Germany, the whole tournament, they were just so German-like.” Compiled by Graham Wray.THIS week’s winner is Sir Reg Holdsworth, in a wig, and Sir Reg Dwight (Elton), in a wig.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And he was right.Likewise when Boris Johnson said “f*** business” after Airbus threatened to pull jobs out of Britain post-Brexit, he wasn’t declaring war on firms that employ thousands of people.He was sick of the complaints from foreign companies with a vested interest in keeping the EU sweet — and in lobbying groups like the CBI which back Brussels over Britain.Of course the Tories are keen to ensure Brexit does as little damage as possible to businesses. Job-creation has been their biggest success since 2010.And of course the lack of certainty is worrying some firms. But they, in turn, need to understand this Government’s duty to honour the referendum in full.It cannot abandon red-line commitments — to end free movement, or to trade independently around the world — because big companies which have thrived within the EU don’t like them.Brussels is used to riding roughshod over inconvenient votes. That cannot and must not happen here.The sooner the EU’s corporate supporters grasp it the better.WHY is it OK for every country but England to show off their national pride?The Scots, Welsh, Irish, French, Americans — they love to see their flags adorning homes, offices and streets.Here, the left has made it borderline shameful to put up a St George cross. To them it means you’re parochial and even racist.It is time we killed off that myth and showed the same pride in our flag as the world does in theirs.What better time to start than with Harry Kane’s boys off to a flier in Russia? And where better than the full length of Whitehall?This brilliant idea by ex-Tory minister Nick Boles just needs Theresa May’s nod.Come on, PM . . . get cracking.THE Tories must honour their election vow to protect our troops from witch-hunts.The PM should read the letter from four ex-Cabinet ministers and act.It is a national disgrace that her Government lets veterans be hounded over action they took decades ago in the heat of battle.Our Boys would be right to doubt the Tories’ commitment to them.But at least Labour is not in power.Just one of its MPs turned up to debate bringing in a vital time limit on prosecutions.

And, indeed, free trade is what most people thought they were ­voting for in the 2016 referendum.Free trade, cunningly styled “no deal” by pro-Remain spin doctors, has always been the best option, but has become even more attractive, now that the intransigence and arrogance of EU ­negotiators has become clear.Fair play, Theresa May and David Davis — you gave the negotiations with the EU your best shot but it’s now time to take the road to freedom.Carping critics say they could have done better, but the public instinctively knows that you’ve tried hard and that it takes two to tango.So, let’s be bold and scrap all tariffs on Brexit day, March 29, 2019.It will immediately boost living ­standards, by reducing prices, and will be especially beneficial for the less well-off. Juncker will cry into his claret at the new, competitive UK.Even companies such as BMW and Airbus, which urged us to join the euro and asked their workers to vote Remain, will benefit.Their engines, and other components imported from the EU, would continue to be free of tariffs. However, ­components from outside the EU would also become tariff-free, which is not usually the case today. Not only that, but their workers would be better off too, which is a plus for any business.And instead of sending £39billion into Brussels’ unaudited coffers, let’s invest the money here.Dividing it equally among our 650 MPs would allow each one to spend £60million in their constituency, on local projects. If MPs don’t like that suggestion, the £39billion could instead be used to reduce taxes or government debt. Our democratically elected Parliament can debate the best approach and decide.Most of us understand Chancellor Philip Hammond’s dogged attempts to get public expenditure under control, after the trauma of the credit crunch.But, it must make sense to invest this money in the UK, rather than the EU.Finally, free of Juncker’s shackles, we can regain control of our fishing waters, boosting the morale and income of our beleaguered coastal communities.No longer will 60 per cent of fish in UK waters be landed by EU boats.The public, too, has its role to play now. Project Fear, promoted by the CBI, the Financial Times and big businesses, has tried to frighten us with threats of gridlocked Channel ports and lorry parks across Kent when we leave the EU.Few believe them, but let’s call their bluff. UK consumers and businesses should now start to favour and prefer non-EU and British products wherever possible, dramatically reducing pressure on those ports.Wetherspoon has started by swapping champagne for UK and Aussie sparkling wine, and German wheat beer for the English and Welsh equivalent.As a result of this tactic, the public is benefitting from equal or better quality and lower prices. And there are a large number of other EU products that can be replaced in all pubs and supermarkets in the next year or two.The public instinctively understands the benefits of world trade, so let’s make buying non-EU a national goal for the next few years.It’s tough on our excellent EU ­suppliers, of course, but that’s the price the continent is paying, unfortunately, for a failing and undemocratic system, with unelected apparatchiks like Juncker and Barnier in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And for the sake of society, it is absolutely right that this twisted soul was sentenced to life and should remain behind bars for decades.But the truth is that Kouider is not your average female inmate. In fact, she’s almost one of a kind.In the age of “equality”, it’s not fashionable to say that men and women are ­different. But when it comes to ­criminality, there can be no argument.Women make up a ­vanishingly small minority of those in the criminal justice system, representing less than five per cent — and in all but the most exceptional of ­circumstances, the crimes that get them incarcerated are, to put it plainly, petty.In 2016, more women were sent to prison to serve a sentence for theft than for violence against the person, robbery, sexual offences, fraud, drugs and ­motoring offences combined — and 80 per cent of those locked up for theft were shoplifters.In the past decade, the number of ­community sentences for women has fallen by nearly half. In 2016 alone, 8,447 women were put behind bars, depriving around 20,000 children of their mothers.These children will now be shunted around family members or placed in care, eating up even more limited resources than the £36,000 it costs to imprison someone for a year.And they will be stigmatised, probably for life, through no fault of their own. Whatever the macho “tough on crime” politicians say, it is plain that nothing is achieved by locking up women for minor offences.If we want to avoid pouring more of taxpayers’ hard-earned cash down the black hole of the broken prison ­system, we need to stop lumping ­vulnerable women in with violent men and start confronting the complex ­reasons behind their rare appearances in the ­justice system.Research shows that women in prison have often been victims of much more serious offences than the ones they are accused of committing.More than half report having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse as a child compared to under a third of men behind bars — and 57 per cent report having been ­victims of domestic violence.Depressingly, because many women fear disclosing abuse, both figures are likely to be an underestimate.The abusers, it would seem, are also the ones pushing their female partners into a life of crime.Nearly half of women in prison (48 per cent) questioned for the Surveying ­Prisoner Crime Reduction survey reported having ­committed offences to support someone else’s drug use, ­compared to just 22 per cent of men.Manipulated, under-educated and all but broken, these women suddenly ­surface in the criminal justice system, ­desperate for the help which would enable them to put their lives back on track.But instead of offering it, we treat them just the same as the low-lives who ground them down in the first place.And it’s creating a cycle of crime.Overall, 48 per cent of women leaving prison are reconvicted within one year.For those serving sentences of less than 12 months, the reconviction rate rises to 61 per cent.This statistic is hardly surprising when you bear in mind that many women lose everything as a result of imprisonment, and 60 per cent of them don’t have homes to go to on release.Without accommodation, it is much harder to get a job or training ­placement, or arrange benefits or care for children so, understandably, they turn back to petty crime.Women like Kouider must always be locked away and no one is suggesting for one moment that serious crimes should go unpunished. But when you have nearly half of all women in jail to support the drug use of someone else and nearly half having attempted suicide at some point in their lifetime — a figure more than seven times higher than that of the general population — it would very much suggest that ­incarceration is not the wisest response.And at last, the Government is latching on. Justice Secretary David Gauke has now abandoned plans for five community prisons for women in England and Wales. Instead, the Ministry of Justice will trial five residential centres to help offenders with issues such as finding work and drug rehabilitation.It may be a small step — vulnerable men are still at risk of falling through the net and Gauke must address that, too — but it’s in the right direction.If we are to stop our shuddering prison system from imploding entirely, we must start by separating the victims from the criminals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, and across the globe. Pourquoi? (That means “why” and is usually accompanied by a shrug and slightly hysterical hand gestures.)Fewer and fewer British kids are learning French in school. The number studying this absurd language has dropped by 30,000 in the past seven years. Instead, our children are learning languages which might actually prove to be useful later on in life.French is useful only if you visit France — and even then they’ll pretend not to understand you.Oh, and a small bunch of arid and desolate African countries which — trust me on this — you are never going to visit. Unless you want a dose of the Ebola virus or your head chopped off. French does not make the top ten of languages spoken worldwide.It only just crawls into the top 20 — between Marathi and Korean, since you asked. Marathi is spoken by some people in India. Not a huge amount of people, frankly. Nice people though, I’m sure.The Africans have learned the utter uselessness of French.In the past few years two countries from that continent have ditched French as the second language and replaced it with — of course — English. That’s Rwanda and Gabon. The switch has proved very popular indeed. More countries are set to follow suit.Do you know where else they don’t speak French any more? France. Well, in French universities. Science subjects such as physics and maths are taught in English.This is because foreign students coming to France don’t want to have to encumber themselves by learning a new language which will be of less use to them later than Swahili or Gaelic.This has been too long in coming. Right now, more and more British schools are switching to Spanish.This makes sense because while 437million people in the world speak Spanish as a first language — i.e. Spain, Central and most of South America — only about 75million speak French.That’s France, half of Belgium and about nine people in Switzerland.But never mind Spanish, important though it is. Foreign languages are too often neglected by British students.And yet we need them to compete in the world. English is the international language of commerce and culture, sure.I would make it compulsory for kids to learn Mandarin from the age of five. And as a second choice, Spanish — which we’re getting good at — or Arabic.Hell, we could do with knowing what that lot are up to. Our security services have struggled because too few English people have any knowledge of Arabic.And how about Russian?We need a bit of a revolution in the way we teach foreign languages here.For too long we have glided by thinking we need to learn nothing. Just a verse or two of Frere Jacques, that’ll do.But the world is changing and our schools need to change with it.Right now they are beginning to do so, but too slowly.Get the kids learning stuff which will help them compete in the world. And shove French in the trash can of history.Ding dang dong, indeed.THE wags seem to have had a nice night out in St Petersburg.Good for them.I do miss Abbey Clancy from the line-up, though.I suppose it would be a bit much to put Peter Crouch up front just so we got a chance to see her again.JUST as the England team looks like it’s going places and everyone’s happy, there’s a beer shortage.This is because of a national shortage of carbon dioxide.How the hell can we have a shortage of THAT?Your average human breathes out almost three pounds of the stuff every day.This is a national crisis and I think I have the answer.We need to get some people who are of no other use to the world to sit in vast vats of flat lager, belching continuously.Diane Abbott, for example.Humans involved in strenuous exercise exhale even more CO2 – maybe 12 pounds a day. So, Diane, on a treadmill, in a vast vat of lager, belching continuously. Yum.SO, the adolescent, unemployable liberal scumbags are still trying to get Donald Trump’s visit to the UK cancelled.Lefties who cannot bear to hear people express different views to their own will be staging infantile protests across London.There are even plans to have a giant blimp of the US president flying across the capital.A typically nasty and childish little prank by people who cannot abide democracy.And who do not care that the US is our major ally – and especially important once we have left the European Union.The protests are being supported by such organisations as ActionAid, which calls itself a charity.Make sure you never give those people any of your money.And one more thing, you protestors. You think Trump is only in power for four years? Think again. He will win again.Just as other populists are winning elections across Europe.The liberals have lost the argument and they are losing at the polls.NOTHING has given me as much pleasure during the World Cup as watching that fat, cheating coke-head Diego Maradona being hauled out of his seat, drunk out of his skull and incapable of standing.Hand of God – yeah. And the septum of Danniella Westbrook.The only downside was that the Argies won their game against Nigeria, undeservedly. They now face France in the next round.Argentina versus France. Like deciding who you want to win in a fist fight between Jeremy Corbyn and Nick Clegg. You kind of hope they’ll annihilate each other and no team goes through.It’s been a great World Cup so far, and very well run by the Russians. Best teams? Croatia, certainly. But England are still in the chasing pack.And how very sad to wave goodbye to the Germans. Cheerio! Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Who would have thought?Did he mention that Airbus, who have been warning of plague and pestilence if we dare to leave, have just been found to have received illegal subsidies worth £17billion from . . . the EU?Did he tell his audience that even Financial Times bosses — a paper so comfortable in Brussels’ bosom it could redesign its masthead as a blue-and-yellow brassiere — think German car manufacturers need a UK trade deal, regardless of what BMW say? Did he heck.Big businesses have done very well out of the EU for years. They’ll resist every possible attempt to reform it or improve it and in Greg Clark they’ve got a man unimaginative enough to believe everything they say.There are plenty of other businesses who are looking to the future with confidence and are excited about Britain striking out on their own.And those outfits who are complaining about Brexit will adjust, just as they did when we (thankfully) didn’t join the Euro, because we’ve got the fifth largest economy in the world and they’d be mad to turn their back on us.It’s time the PM backed Brexit voters over corporate doom-mongers.LOVE Island’s Adam is a nasty piece of work.How ITV can justify him still being on the show despite being caught sending sleazy messages to a 17-year-old girl is beyond us.People have been thrown off for much less.

For years, the 68-year-old has been a scourge of the Royal Family and many were questioning whether it was appropriate for her to making such claims against the much-revered couple, who are in their nineties.Some dismissed them as “total bunkum”. Respected commentator Judy Wade said last night: “I have never seen Lady Colin Campbell with a member of the Royal Family, or on a job about the Royal Family. You can say whatever you like about the Queen because she won’t sue, but it doesn’t mean it is true.”In her 320-page book, The Queen’s Marriage — which she theatrically unveiled at a London press event — Lady Colin “reveals” what she says are secrets of the royal bedchamber. She insists “a variety of sources” told her of Philip and the Queen’s sexual passion, especially on their honeymoon at Lord Mountbatten’s Hampshire home, Broadlands.Using the Queen’s family nickname of Lilibet, she writes that “the servants were full of talk about how patently Lilibet enjoyed her introduction to the pleasures of the flesh”.“He also let slip to his other Mountbatten cousin, Patricia, that Lilibet had the most beautiful skin all over. There has never been any doubt that they had a torrid time between the sheets. It started in her marriage and continued throughout, and there was never any secret about it. Philip himself said she was a goer and in civilised circles an appreciation of sex has never been regarded as shameful but a sign of good health.”Lady Colin also described Philip as a “great flirt”, claiming she had first-hand experience. She said last night: “He loves the company of beautiful women. He’s a huge flirt. I don’t know any pretty girl he hasn’t flirted with. He’s flirted with me before. He’s never said anything untoward, he’s just flirtatious. The sort of thing he says is, ‘You’re looking good tonight’, but he is a flirt.The Queen didn’t mind at all. She gave him free rein to have Cavalier Servente — where you have friendships with the opposite sex, which are very close. To Philip they were like pets, they were his playthings. He even called them his playmates, they shared physical activities like carriage driving, and interests. It is a constructive way of keeping him occupied and entertained.At the book launch, Lady Colin added that Philip’s flirting helped fuel rumours he had cheated on the Queen. She said: “Problems started as soon as The Queen came to the throne, when courtiers went out of their way to cause problems within the marriage. Up to the point of accession they had a happy, picture-perfect marriage.”The book also suggests that when the Queen helped prevent Princess Margaret marrying divorced royal equerry Peter Townsend, her sister took revenge and spread rumours about Philip cheating.“A fashionable psychiatrist, who was very much part of the smart set, told me, ‘She cracked up under the strain of her sister’s revelations about Prince Philip’s activities’.”But Lady Colin said she believes Philip did not sleep with his close friend, Lady Penny Romsey, who he was often seen in the company of, causing much gossip. She writes: “Penny’s friends also have no doubt that the relationship, though passionate and loving, does not, and never did, include sex.”Other royals targeted in the book include Prince Charles, who she brands a “world-class moaner” — behaviour fostered by the Queen Mother, who encouraged Charles to be extravagant and luxury-loving. Lady C writes: “This caused conflict with his parents, both of whom were thrifty by nature.”Lady Colin said she “never had any pressure from the Palace” to tone down her revelations. She said defiantly: “They know I am honest and they’ve known about this book for a while.“What I have written stands the test of time and if it’s going to come out it may as well come out through somebody who is even-handed and balanced, and has no anti-Monarchist agenda.”But doubts were raised about how well-placed Lady Colin really is to know such intimate details.Judy Wade, who has written seven books about the royals, said: “She does dish the dirt. Readers should approach with caution.”The Queen’s former press secretary, Dickie Arbiter, said: “I will not dignify anything Lady Colin Campbell writes or says with a comment.”A spokeswoman from Buckingham Palace declined to comment.After hitting puberty and insisting that she was a girl, she claims her wealthy father reacted by sending her to a hospital and having her pumped full of steroids.  But by the time she was 18 her father accepted her as a woman.Three years later she was a successful model living as “Georgie”, having finally had the corrective surgery she craved.  In 1974, aged 24, she hit the headlines when she married confirmed bachelor Lord Colin Campbell having known him for just five days.The hedonistic couple had a rocky and unusual marriage – one time they supposedly invited a stranger into their bed so an unwilling Lord Colin would consummate their marriage.  At first she confided in her husband about her troubled childhood, but things turned sour and he allegedly abused her and broke her jaw.  After just eight months the couple dramatically split up.Lord Colin sold his wife’s gender-change story to the papers as their divorce became ever more acrimonious. Yet his family had also been caught up in a sex scandal in 1963 when his mother, Lady Margaret the 11th Duchess of Argyll, was pictured performing a sexual act on a man whose head was not captured in the photograph.Later, Lady Colin revealed the “headless man” was American businessman William H Lyons, and claimed his identity had been an open family secret.  Despite Lady Colin’s turbulent marriage and eight-year affair with aristocrat James Buchanan-Jardine, the mum of two is perhaps best known for her tell-all book about Princess Diana, which revealed an affair with James Hewitt and told of the princess’s battle with bulimia.Although at the time the claims were thought to be extraordinary, Lady Colin was proved right on both counts.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That was exactly what the meeting had been about, and everybody there knew it.The summit was Operation Save Mutti. Their mission: To stop Merkel’s government collapsing by thrashing out a tough stance on immigration to calm her critics. It’s quite a turnaround.Once, Merkel, with her open-door refugee policy, was queen of Europe. Now she’s a beggar. Suddenly, European politics has changed beyond recognition.The tide has turned. Those making the case for an open Europe are haunted and chastised. They are losing elections.Italy’s new coalition of left and right-wing populists is a fiesta of political contradictions, but they share one goal: To stop the migration population from growing.They want a European refugee policy that is pretty similar to what Austria is advocating.Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s young and energetic Chancellor, has begun to talk about “an axis of the willing” between his country, Italy and Germany.He has canvassed allies in Germany for his ideas on migration reform.Many in Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are tired of her and her centrist style of leadership and see Kurz as their hero.Earlier this month he staged a press conference with Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister, coalition partner and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party.Seehofer now wants Germany to turn away migrants who do not have documents or who first applied for asylum in another EU country. Merkel has refused. If the decades-old CDU-CSU alliance ends over this issue, Merkel’s government would collapse.Until recently, it was assumed that Merkel would last until the next elections in three years’ time.Now many are betting she won’t even make it through the summer.There are two kinds of European solidarity now: The Merkel type and the Kurz type.To survive, Merkel must find a way to reconcile the two, but she is perhaps the only leader in Europe who thinks that is still possible.Countries to the north, south and east of Germany have already moved away from her refugee vision.Denmark and Sweden reinstated border controls in 2015.Viktor Orban, in Hungary, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, in Poland — often dismissed as loonies and fruitcakes — feel that their views on immigration have been vindicated, not just at home but across Europe. And why shouldn’t they?Much as their migration policies are flawed, they are winning the battle of ideas over border controls and openness.They have many new allies in European capitals. Slovakia and the Czech Republic now have leaders who complain about Muslim immigration.And yes, Emmanuel Macron’s victory was astonishing — but a third of France still voted for right-winger Marine Le Pen.Merkel’s view of Europe was the consensus. When Macron took power, it was hoped Europe would be purged of grubby thoughts about migrants.Merkel’s case for a common European policy on refugees seemed likely to win.But the elections in Italy and Austria changed all that. Having populists in former Soviet bloc states is one thing. Having them running Western European states is quite another.The balance of power keeps changing, shifting ever further from Merkel.The incoming Slovenian PM, Janez Jansa, is a migration hardliner and, like others in the Balkan region, sees Europe’s political future as being represented by Budapest rather than Berlin.So what to do? Merkel now stands as the charity case, not the powerbroker.Macron offers her some respite, saying he will help her by taking back the few asylum seekers in Germany who registered first in France.But far more refugees will have registered first in Italy, and the odds on its new government taking them are slim. In Austria, Kurz is focusing on a plan to force refugees to apply for asylum before they enter the EU.When Austria assumes the EU’s rotating presidency next month, Kurz will make this a centrepiece of his agenda. Kurz’s stance is unacceptable to Merkel. Belgium and the Netherlands are also protesting because they fear that forcing migrants to apply from overseas centres will lead to inhumane migration detention camps, as seen in Australia.But can Merkel fight against it?If she wants to stay in power she will need to be wary of those in her own CDU ranks who are closer to Seehofer.If her leadership recently took them to their worst election results since 1949, what might await them after more years of Merkel in power?Whatever she now chooses to do will cause her reputation to crumble.If she fires Seehofer, it may be the end of the German centre-right as the party in charge.If she goes along with Austrian and Italian demands to turn back migrants, she will be admitting that her open-door policy on migration killed her own vision of a welcoming Europe.She has run out of good options, as well as political authority. She may limp on in Germany for a few more years, but her long reign in Europe has ended.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The last time we had a summer like this 1976.”She attributed the dangerously high pollen counts to the rainfall in spring that helped grass to grow – with the pollen now released thanks to the warm temperatures.Dr Emberlin warned the stretch of days with a high pollen count could be making it worse for sufferers.She said: “What tends to happen is that people become more sensitive as the season goes on, unless they have controlled their symptoms.“They may develop more symptoms over five to seven days, including getting tired and head aches because of hay fever.”The sneezy season comes as temperatures continue to rise 10C above average - with the weekend again expected to see temperatures in the high 20s and conditions to remain dry and sunny.The Met Offices Ms Chivers said there was an extremely small chance of showers across the south east.She added: We have a very large, high pressure system over the top of us and that means dry weather and cloudless skies.It looks like its going to carry on into next week - theres no end in sight.This week has seen records tumble, with four days crowned the hottest day of the year.Highs were recorded across the UK -  making it the first time in five years that temperatures have hit 30C in all four nations of the UK.The hottest temperatures recorded were 33C in Porthmadog, Wales.But the heatwave has sparked health warnings with conditions expected to remain hot and sunny over the weekend.The Met Offices heat-health watch alert remains at level two, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.Authorities have also issued warnings to cut shower times down to just four minutes as temperatures continue to sizzle.With no rain on the horizon, the South East is set for its driest June since records began.The heat has caused havoc for commuters after rail services imposed speed limits on trains due to overheating tracks caused by the steel on tracks to expand and sometimes buckle.South Western Railway said temperatures were expected to reach 47C on many parts of its route this week.The heatwave could even top a blistering 38C in the coming months, raising fears this summer could be even worse than the Lucifer heatwave last year."},{"url":null,"title":"delta flight attendant kicks off passengers phone airplane mode","story":"The unnamed Delta Airlines attendant was filmed arguing with Robyn Rodgers, a DJ from New York, before the plane took off from Fort Wayne airport in Indiana on June 23.Other passengers then spoke up for Robyn who claimed she had switched her device off.The musician can be heard telling the cabin crew member that she was holding up the flight while later claiming the woman stood over her “menacingly”.In the clip, the staff member said: “I know what I heard.

Thomas in 192 - is wrong.While respectable for its time, the results of these new analyses, combined with a thorough checking of the archived samples consulted by Thomas, reveal that key locations long believed to be sources for the Stonehenge bluestones can be discounted in favour of newly identified locations at Craig-Rhos-y-felin and Carn Goedog.A study claims that the stones were moved from Pembrokeshire to Wiltshire on route using roads and rivers.The smaller bluestones come from Pembrokeshire, and the huge sarsens come from Marlborough Downs.However it is unknown where the sandstone of the main Altar Stone originates, but Richard Bevins of the Museum of Wales and Rob Ixer of the University of Leicester told The Times that it very probably came from the Senni Beds which go from Llanelli to Herefordshire.Stonehenge was built in three stages, with some parts being a huge 5,000 years old. The outer bank of Stonehenge was made in around 3000 BC, while the stone settings were built in 2500 BC.Hundreds of people helped to construct the landmark, and the stones were worked into shape using sarsen and flint hammerstones.Today, Stonehenge is linked to the druids - and many people wrongly think they built the structure.Stonehenge is copmprised of megaliths, which are large stones used to construct a monument without the use of a mortar or concrete.These stones often feature in prehistoric structures where modern tools and techniques were not available.The term megalith is also used to describe a moniment such as Stonehenge because it features multiple rocks.Stonehenges biggest stones are up to 9 metres tall, and weigh 25 tons.However the term monolith is used to describe a structure such as the Gavea Rock in Brazil which is comprised of one single massive rock or stone.These can include mountains, and originates from the term monolithus which means single or one.However, archaeologists believe it was constructed by three groups - the Neolithics, the Beaker people and the Wessex Peoples - who are said to have finalised the site into what we see today.The latest theory, advanced by archaeologist and writer Mike Pitts, is that the rocks were there millions of years before humans arrived.His theory, which was published in British Archaeology, suggest that the rocks alignment with the solstice sun was merely a coincidence.It was this accidental alignment that got the boulders noticed by early Brits, who then decided to build it up into a proper monument."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000407549635.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry meghan markle honeymoon rumours namibia","story":"The couple had been tipped to travel to Namibia thanks to the 33-year-old royals strong ties to southwest Africa.But Prince Harry put the rumour to bed during a chat with Mavis Elias, a philanthropist from Namibia, at the Queens Young Leaders Awards Ceremony on Tuesday, The Mirror reported.The Love Is Charity founder asked Harry if he visited her home country and he responded: No, we didnt go to Namibia.And the royal seemed keen to keep the real destination under wraps.Gesturing to listening media as he added: Im not going to say where.Namibia had been hotly tipped as a possible honeymoon destination for the couple.Harry and Meghan had been expected to stay at the Hoanib Valley Camp in Kaokoland for the romantic getaway after marrying at St Georges Chapel in Windsor Castle.Harry is a big fan of the country - after spending time there with ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy in 2006, as part of the Army in 2008 and working on conservation projects in 2015.And he also spent a significant length of time in neighbouring Botswana with Meghan, with the couple even celebrating Prince Harrys birthday there.The Sun revealed last year that the couple actually decided to wed while on the romantic holiday in Botswana in 2017.The loved-up pair committed to marriage when they were camping under the stars in the African wilderness, just a year after they started dating.For Meghans first ever safari, the pair stayed in a luxurious tented bush camp at Meno a Kwena, boasting incredible views over the Boteti River and African bush.Harry later said of the trip: Going on holiday together in the middle of nowhere and sharing a tent together and all that kind of stuff.It was fantastic.Harry even sourced the main stone in the engagement ring he gave to Meghan from Botswana, which is one of the world’s most renowned places for diamond mining.The couple may well have still travelled to another part of Africa for their honeymoon.Prince Harry has previously revealed his affinity with Africa - even missing his niece Princess Charlottes christening in order to help with anti-poaching efforts in Namibia.While on his trip he slept outside in the bush, telling one of his colleagues: Ive come all the way to Africa to be free.

These are likely to go unfulfilled, because he flaunts them so crassly.Yet before acknowledging that the Armed Forces need more money, which they do, we should recognise how hard it is to configure Britain’s defence and security posture at a time when threats and the means to address them are changing at awesome speed.Countering terrorism in some ways represents the least ­difficult element, because it is the only peril the public really cares about.It is evident to all save ­disciples of Julian Assange that electronic surveillance through GCHQ, supported by the intelligence services, armed police and military special forces, deserves generous funding, which it nowadays receives.It is much more difficult to identify the appropriate tools with which to equip the Armed Forces to meet the strategic threats, of which Russia ­represents the most obvious.When President Putin favours hybrid warfare embracing covert special forces, fake news, cyber attacks and subversion, are tanks and infantry battalions the appropriate responses?When US backing for Nato is wavering and key nations such as Germany forswear a serious combat capability, alongside what allies can we hope to present a common front?These are big and hard ­questions.A couple of months ago at a round-table dinner, some of Britain’s top generals and ­strategic gurus held forth about the threats as they see them.Afterwards, the former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who was among the guests, told me that he had been disappointed by the ­unoriginality of the ideas expressed.Here were the brightest and best in the war studies ­universe, he suggested, still thinking inside the parameters of the familiar, when much that is unfamiliar is evolving all around us.In planning for the future, Army commanders deserve sympathy, because they are compelled to observe ­constraints imposed by public sentimentality, to which ­ministers make obeisance.For instance, the chronically under-recruited Scottish regiments should be reduced, instead of having their ranks filled with Fijians (yes, really), but that is politically unthinkable.Nobody dares to axe a foot guards battalion, because the Guards Division remains a powerful trades union.The Gurkhas, whose infrastructure and dependants’ costs now make them uneconomic, cannot be touched because no minister will risk Joanna ­Lumley once more taking to the streets on their behalf. ­Politicians, in their own defence, are entitled to point out that the leaders of the Armed Forces are often poor judges of strategic planning.The admirals of two decades ago begged, fought and pleaded for the Navy’s two preposterous carriers, which I have compared to the Egyptian pyramids — huge consumers of resources for negligible practical utility.It was always obvious that the F-35 aircraft for which they were designed are properly unaffordable by modern Britain.Beyond being described by Americans as “the planes that ate the Pentagon” because of their fantastic cost, recent assessments show them ­performing poorly in the key ground attack role, as do the RAF’s Typhoons, conceived as high-altitude interceptors.Moreover, it was always plain that almost the entire Royal Navy’s residual strength will be required to escort the carriers on active service, while they are incapable of inshore operation.A strong government and Defence Secretary would mothball the behemoths in a display of courage such as was last shown by Denis Healey in 1968 when he decided to withdraw British forces from east of Suez.Forces need more of almost everythingThey would also scrap the Trident deterrent replacement, again a big willy gesture for a little willy nation, inappropriate to our diminished status in the world.I know almost no one whom I respect in the defence loop — military or civilian — who favours trying to sustain a nuclear capability on the ­Trident scale.More money must be found to recruit, train and exercise a credible Army.The only certainty about ­Britain’s defence needs is that more soldiers are wanted, to meet a range of future threats.Something much more serious than the fanatics of IS could well confront Britain in the coming decades.American military friends often remind me that Britain’s Armed Forces today command respect neither from friends nor foes.I remember General Sir Mike Jackson saying ­ruefully, as head of the Army 12 years ago: “Mass matters, and we don’t have it.”Our rulers may sometimes be forgiven for lying to us, but should never be forgiven for lying to themselves, as ­members of this Government do repeatedly.Bits of Britain’s Armed Forces are still superb, but it will not do for ministers merely to keep reciting the tired mantra about how terrific the SAS is.This is a niche force, no more capable of frightening Russia or China than the England cricket team.Gavin Williamson is dead right, that our Armed Forces need more of almost everything.Such a pity, then, that he himself has no more credibility at Westminster than an England cricket coach.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the deal was \"good news\", while Ms Merkel echoed his sentiments but acknowledged deep divisions remained among member states.\"Overall, after an intensive discussion on the most challenging theme for the EU, namely migration, it is a good signal that we agreed a common text,\" she said.\"We still have a lot of work to do to bridge the different views.\"Mrs Merkel had previously warned the EU\u0027s \"destiny\" was at stake if it failed to reach an agreement."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-eu-summit_4348509.jpg?20180629010550 ","title":"frustration for eu leaders as may stalls on brexit during summit","story":"In reality, Brexit has been eclipsed by a far more pressing career crisis for German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the EU migration row pushes her government to the brink.Ahead of the summit she warned that the migration crisis could make or break the EU, but Italy\u0027s first populist government appears to not have got the memo.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte blocked all joint decisions - on a range of matters from defence co-operation to digital innovation - ahead of the summit dinner, catching his counterparts off guard.Concerned about the pressures on frontline countries, Mr Conte is angry that the focus has shifted in recent days as Chancellor Merkel tries to snuff out the political crisis in her own country by trying to strike bilateral deals to make it easier for Germany to send asylum seekers back to other EU states.Other leaders are more keen to help.Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg told Sky News: \"I think migration is the biggest issue now, down to the fact we need to find solutions.\"We\u0027re going into the summer season and we know there\u0027s more people in the Med and there\u0027s a need for new projects.\"As Operation Save Merkel kicks in, Mrs May will make her way back to London to prepare for her own crunch summit in 10 days\u0027 time.She will gather her cabinet at her Chequers country retreat to finally set out exactly what she wants from Brexit.Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said today that Brussels, and Dublin, are fed up with waiting.\"We actually need to see the white paper from the British government as to what they believe the relationship should be like,\" he told Sky News.\"And it is frustrating two years after the referendum that we still don\u0027t have a white paper from the UK government as to what they think the relationship should look like.\":: EU migration summit deadlocked by ItalyBut the EU is also using this summit to remind the prime minister that they are prepared to trade with her too.The draft guidelines have been redrafted to reiterate to Mrs May that the bloc could improve their offer if she softens some of those red lines.\"The EU27, including Ireland, have always said that we\u0027re willing to be flexible if the UK softens its red lines well then we will soften ours as well,\" the taoiseach added.Pressing Mrs May to move on her red lines is the growing drumbeat."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/2048x1152/skynews-cash-machine-atm_4218857.jpg?20180131113537 ","title":"water shortage critical following uk and ireland heatwave","story":":: Fill a jug with water and keep it in the fridge.

With that, Dyer leaves, slamming the door behind him. The EU leaders look at each other in growing wonder, having just been told where they were going wrong all this time.

He accused the former PM of scuttling off after plunging the country into the confusion of EU withdrawal. But a spokesman for Mr Cameron made clear the former prime minister would not be responding in kind, saying: That\u0027s not something we will be commenting on.

Last week, YouTube personalities Paul Joseph Watson, Sargon of Akkad, Count Dankula and former tech blogger Milo Yiannopoulos announced they were joining the ailing party. And the party has welcomed their new members, who prefer to label themselves ‘classical liberals’ or ’radical centrists’ rather than ‘alt-right’. What unites them is a fundamentalist, almost fanatical defence of ‘freedom of speech’. In practice, that often means the freedom to say whatever they want and attack whomever they please, however they please to their enormous and engaged social media following, without consideration or consequence. Ukip has welcomed them with open arms, and their arrival is likely to inject a new and different energy into the party, which has teetered on the brink of irrelevance since the Brexit referendum. But could they make Ukip dangerous again? How did this happen?  Party leader Gerard Batten signalled a shift in Ukip’s priorities earlier this year, by publicly supporting Tommy Robinson and speaking alongside the EDL founder at a ‘free speech’ march earlier this year. As a former EDL member, Robinson, who is currently in prison, is banned from joining Ukip for life. Who are the new faces? Count Dankula  Earlier this month , Mark Meechan, better known as Count Dankula told his Twitter followers he would join Ukip if they retweeted him 10,000 times. They did and he did. Meechan was successfully prosecuted for publishing a video in which he appeared to teach his girlfriend\u0027s pug to do a nazi salute every time he said \u0027gass the Jews\u0027. He is also a vocal supporter of Tommy Robinson.  Paul Joseph Watson   Watson was next. He is ‘editor-at-large’ at conspiracy theory website InfoWars, which has repeatedly claimed the Sandy Hook massacre may have been faked by the government. And he has regularly told “the truth about Islam” , complained about “social justice warriors” and immigration and made unfounded claims about Hillary Clinton’s health to the 875,000 followers on his @PrisonPlanet Twitter account. Sargon of Akkad  Around the same time, Carl Benjamin, AKA Sargon of Akkad, paid his \u0026pound30 membership fee. Benjamin is a YouTube shouter, who has described Harvey Weinstein’s victims as “gold digging whores” and defended Elliot Rodger as a “poor f**king guy” who had no option” but to murder six people because of feminism.  And finally, Milo Yiannopoulos joined the gang. Yiannopoulos is under fire today after telling a reporter he couldn’t wait for “vigilante squads to start gunning journalists down”, days before five people, including journalists were gunned down in a Maryland newsroom.

Then it’s probably time to upgrade your stereo to something with more features and better performance…\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHolly Thatcher17:29, 28 JUN 2018Updated11:14, 29 JUN 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen you think back to the family car journeys from your childhood, there’s a good chance that many of them were spent listening to the crackle and whine of a sporting event played out on an old-fashioned medium wave radio. Given how much the technology in our homes has advanced, it’s surprising how many of us are still using a last generation radio– particularly as DAB upgrades and wireless connectivity for cars are so affordable. If you think it could be time for an upgrade, here\u0027s some helpful tips for choosing a stereo, and some specific recommendations. Upgrading for sound   Depending on the age of your car, even a modest update could improve the sound. Even if your car came with a digital radio, it might even be worth upgrading to one that supports DAB+ for even better digital quality and more stations. What can your car handle?   Car stereos are usually sold in two sizes: either single or double DIN. As a rule, a double DIN stereo will be able to offer you a bigger screen. It’s far easier to create a stereo that offers built-in navigation in a double DIN socket, and with many modern stereos offering video playback when you’re stationary, it’s useful to have the extra screen size. What to look for in an upgrade   If your car stereo doesn’t have Bluetooth built in, then upgrading will give you access to the music on a Bluetooth-equipped phone. That means you\u0027ll be able to listen to music streamed from Spotify or Apple Music while you drive. Many car stereos have a 3.5mm line-in (headphone jack style), while some now offer USB ports. So even if your phone isn\u0027t Bluetooth enabled, connecting an iPhone, iPod or Android phone will allow you to play music over the USB connection and keep your phone charged at the same time. The Sony MEX-N4200BT offers all of the above and costs just \u0026pound99. There’s even a CD player here for your retro music (so the kids can say, what’s that funny silver circle?). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto   One of the greatest upgrades you can get for your car is to add support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Stereos that use these are designed to make your phone an important part of your entertainment system - they allow you to navigate, communicate and play music, with intelligent voice control via Bluetooth (Siri with Apple CarPlay or voice control with Android Auto). You’ll need a recent phone to use either system. CarPlay works on the iPhone 5 and newer, while you need Android Lollipop (version 5) on your phone to use Android Auto. But not all Android phones support Auto, so be sure to check before buying anything. Some stereos support both CarPlay and Android Auto while some only offer one or the other. Again, it’s wise to check before you buy - Halfords experts can help you choose the right stereo for both your car and phone. Once connected to either system, you’ll be presented with a selection of apps: Google Maps for navigation on Android or Apple Maps on an iPhone. You can also access your music and podcasts through the clear and intuitive interface. Many systems will also give you hands-free calling and voice-activated features like Siri.

Glamorous boys and girls began arriving from 8am this morning in an array of vehicles and outfits as hundreds of residents lined the streets to watch. And while most students wear one dress for their prom, many here opt for two - one for the day and another for the evening meal and disco. Some even woke up at the crack of dawn to get their hair and makeup professionally done, and the event is considered bigger than a lot of people\u0027s weddings. Colourful pictures show high-spirited GCSE pupils arriving at their big day in a spectacular line of vintage cars.  The elaborate displays were put on by 15 and 16-year-old pupils at Somervale School, Midsomer Norton, Somerset. It is a small town which has built a reputation for its no-expense-spared school proms. In previous years pupils at the two secondary schools have tried to upstage each other by arriving in ice cream vans, tractors, mobility scooters - and even a TANK. This year, the most unusual included a VW camper van nicknamed ‘Mr Happy’ and a vintage orange Mustang. Preparations begin in September for the annual occasion, which started at 8am on Friday morning with pupils from the younger years and parents crowding around to watch the procession.  Students flocked to the school dressed in glamorous attire, before leaving at noon to get ready for their evening meal and disco at the Hilton Hotel in Bath, Somerset. The GCSE leavers have been partaking in the prom for more than ten years, and imaginative forms of transport - including some pupils arriving in a boat pulled on a trailer one year - have set a high standard. Staff member Karen Pullman said: “It’s as elaborate as a wedding, with the daytime and evening outfits worn by the girls.” This year pupils arrived in two open top vintage Cadillacs, an orange Mustang, and a VW campervan decked out with ribbons. Pupil Amber Sims, 16, arrived in the campervan with several girlfriends. She said: “I’ve been looking forward to it for the past few months.  “I’ve been planning my outfit since the start of Year 11. “We wanted something different from a limo so chose a camper van. “It was exciting having everyone watching when we arrived.” Her mother Lisa Sims, 44, added: “My son is 18 and went to his prom in a kit car, with his dad dressed as the Stig. “Amber’s organised all of it with her pals, they’re a really good group of friends. “It can be very expensive. We’ve spent about \u0026pound150 on it but some of her friends have spent more on just the dress.”  She doubted her daughter would wear her pink jewelled gown again. Mrs Sims, a mother-of-three, added: “They all look amazing.” The event can can cost an eye-watering amount for parents who foot the bill, including for dresses costing more than \u0026pound400. Tori Collins, 15, arrived in the camper van with Amber, and said: “I got up at 5.30am to do my hair and make-up. “We liked the way the camper van looked, and no-one else was doing it. “It’s good to be different, and it makes you stand out, but it’s not a competition.”  Her mother Sarah Collins, 48, said: “We’ve spent about \u0026pound250 in total, on the car hire, two dresses, one for the daytime and one for the evening. “Then there’s two pairs of shoes, two handbags, getting her nails done, and the evening meal. “That’s with a relatively conservative amount on the dress, which cost \u0026pound25. “Some people spent \u0026pound400 just on a dress. “It must be difficult for some parents but they do all seem to manage, some of them arrive in their parents cars which are decorated for the occasion.”  She added that her son arrived at his prom on a space hopper two years ago. Joe MacLachlan, 16, arrived in a limousine with eight friends, all boys. He said: “We went for a drive around the local area before arriving at school, it was fun, we had music on and just relaxed. “It’s a bit strange seeing everyone in suits.” Nathan Rogers, 16, arrived in a 1965 Cadillac with five friends, also all male. “I think prom is bigged up in America but here it’s a nice thing when you’ve finished exams,” he said. “It gives you something to look forward to.  “Boys tend to go with boys, and girls tend to go with girls. “I think parents see it as a reward for all the hard work with GCSEs.” The prom used as an incentive by the school, and in order to go, pupils must have good attendance, good behaviour, and attend at least two revision sessions either after school or at lunchtime, per week. Of the 85 pupils in Year 11, 60 went to the prom and only a small number were excluded. Others chose not to go, and of the 60 who did, not all were attending the evening event.

Pupils at Totley All Saints Church of England School are \u0027often acting out\u0027 scenarios from the Hunger Games-style title in which 100 players aim to wipe out rivals to be the last person standing. The worrying response to playing the game, which comes with a 12+ certificate, has prompted head teacher Karole Sargent to issue an urgent warning to parents. Writing on the school\u0027s website she wrote: Parents are kindly reminded that the online video game, Fortnite: Battle Royale, has a rating of 12+ \u0026amp therefore should NOT be played by any of our children.  The game has frequent scenes of violence which are often acted out at school causing other children to get hurt as well as some to feel left out if their parents do the right thing of not allowing them to play it until they reach the correct age. Aside from the legal issues, research by child and educational psychologists shows that playing violent video games can become addictive leading to conflict within families \u0026amp is also associated with real life anti-social \u0026amp aggressive behaviour. The school has advised parents to visit the online safety section on their website to find out more about how to protect their children. Fortnite has currently been downloaded by 125 million players across the globe, sparking record numbers of digital addiction and concern among parents.  Its exaggerated gameplay and cartoon-like depiction of violence has resulted in it becoming one of the internet\u0027s most popular games. The game is hugely popular amongst children of all ages, despite its official age limit of 12 years. Earlier this month a Sunday People investigation revealed a nine-year-old girl was forced into rehab after she became so addicted to Fortnite she refused to leave the screen to go to the toilet. Experts fear she is one of many children at risk of developing mental health problems as a result of over-exposure to the fight-to-the-death scenarios.  The girl’s mum told the Sunday People: “We had no idea, when we let her play the game, of the addictive nature or the impact it could have on her mental health. She is in therapy for the addiction after she became withdrawn, agitated and disturbed from playing up to ten hours a day – sometimes playing until dawn, wetting herself so she didn’t have to leave the screen. “This is a serious issue which is destroying our little girl’s life and someone needs to step in to ban it before it becomes an epidemic.” Schools up and down the country have been urging parents to keep their children away from the highly addictive violent shooter game. Teachers say the violent game is behind an increase in poor behaviour by students and is distracting pupils from their work. Teachers have also texted parents to ban the combat game after seeing bleary-eyed pupils wander into class following late-night gaming binges.  One school in Bristol issued a Facebook warning saying: “We’ve heard some of our children, including in Year 3, are playing a game online called Fortnite ... if your child is playing this game talk to them and make sure you know what they are doing.”   A school in Stoke-on-Trent also sent a letter to parents saying discussions about Fornite are so common in classrooms that they are distracting children from their learning. Totley All Saints Church of England School refused to comment when contacted by Mirror. School leaders are now demanding curriculum time to teach healthy online use, as part of Personal Social Health and Economic Education.

Dramatic pictures have been released showing the bitumen melting in parts of the country - with up to eight heatwaves forecast in July and August and temperatures set to hit 34C.  Councils are using gritters to spread sand, effectively a sunscreen for the surface. Images of the melted roads have been shared by the staff of the Communication Workers Union as a warning to try and keep members of the public safe.  One was taken by a post office worker on Exmoor showing the current state of the road from Heasley Mill, near North Molton, Devon. Other images which show roads in Woodbury Salterton, Devon, melting have also been circulated. Tarmac becomes soft at 50C, and while the air temperature is much lower, the black roads can become that hot in direct sunlight. Howard Robinson, chief executive of the Road Surface Treatments Association, said that when temperatures top 30C, the bitumen in some road surfaces may soften and rise to the top. He said: “This makes the road surface sticky and more susceptible to pressure loads from heavy vehicles resulting in surface ridging and rutting. “Most roads will not begin to soften until they hit a temperature of around 50C.  “However, even a sunny day in the 20Cs can be enough to generate 50C on the ground as the dark asphalt road surface absorbs a lot of heat and this builds up during the day. “The response for local highway authorities is to send out the gritters to spread granite dust or sand to absorb the soft bitumen and so stabilise the road surface and make it less sticky. “Drivers may be bemused to see the gritters out in the summer when they are usually spreading grit and salt during the winter. “However, this is effective standard practice for keeping a road surface safe during extreme hot temperatures. “Asphalt is like chocolate – it melts and softens when it’s hot and goes hard and brittle when it’s cold – it doesn’t maintain the same strength all year round.” "},{"url":null,"title":"historic royals seen colour first","story":"NewsHistoric royals seen in colour for the first time thanks to housewifeQueen Victoria, King George V and Queen Mary are among the royals who feature in a stunning set of photos which were originally black and white\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMark McConville13:23, 29 JUN 2018NewsKing George V is among the royals who features in the stunning series of colourised images (Image: Nicola Branson / mediadrumworld.)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMonarchs of the past can now be seen in full colour for the first time - thanks to an enthusiastic royalist housewife. Queen Victoria, King George V and Queen Mary are among the royals who feature in a stunning set of photos which were originally black and white.  A young Princess Margaret , the Queen Mother and Prince Edward as a toddler are also among the newly-colourised pictures.  The images were painstakingly produced by Nicola Branson, from Wellingborough in Northamptonshire. The 47-year-old was initially planning simply to share the pictures on her Instagram page.  She said: I decided to look at the Royals for colouring as a private project originally that I was going to share on my Instagram account, but a few close friends who have seen me working on these photos suggested they were amazed how they looked more like a colour photo rather than a coloured photo. The Royals through their generations have all been very photogenic and my personal favourite is the Queen Mother. My dad, a few months before he died, said to me \u0027what\u0027s the point of having all these photos when now you can keep them on your phone or PC?\u0027 My response was that they are all memories dad, and memories can live forever.  Through today\u0027s technology old photos can be restored and colour added, those people can have pride of place in a photo frame. The British royal family comprises Queen Elizabeth II and her close relations. There is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the British royal family.  Since 1917, when King George V changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, members of the royal family belong, either by birth or by marriage, to the House of Windsor. Nicola, who used Adobe Photoshop to restore and instil colour into the photos, explained how she became interested in the quirky hobby. I started restoring and colourising old photos by my interest in genealogy, she said. When my dad died I started looking at the old photos that had been passed down from my grandparents.

But why is the London Tube so hot and why doesn\u0027t it have air con? While most of the older underground lines are hot, the Central line is by far the worst with temperatures often exceeding the EU limit at which it\u0027s legal to transport livestock. This week the Evening Standard reported how commuters on the red line endured 34.5C heat. But despite the record temperatures it doesn\u0027t look like this will change any time soon as it would major investment from Transport for London to cool it down.   Wired reports that the Central line consistently breaks records with temperatures peaking at 35.5C last summer.  This exceeds the EU limit of 30C at which it is legal to transport cows, sheep and pigs. These red hot temperatures on the crimson line are nothing new with peaks of 30C in July and August 2013, 30.5C in July 2014, 31.04C in August 2016. The only other line to reach such temperatures in the Bakerloo line with 30.91C recorded in September 2016. But it\u0027s almost impossible for TfL to cool down the Central line as it\u0027s just so old.  When engineers built the tube tunnels back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they left no extra space and so there isn\u0027t enough room to install air conditioning units because there\u0027s nowhere for the hot air to escape. As well as this, the clay surrounding the deep running line locks in all the heat. And that clay has been constantly heating up thanks to more people, more trains and more buildings and now measures between 20C and 25C. The Central Line also has much less air shafts compared to other lines and there is little chance of them being installed at this stage as the deep running lines go under some of the most densely populated parts of the city. As well as this, 38 per cent of the heat generated on the tube is from trains breaking and the Central does this more frequently as it is one of the fastest lines and covers 49 stations over 46 miles.  TfL\u0027s only way of cooling down the line is on a station-to-station basis where the introduce fan cooling systems that pull fresh air from the street, cool it and then pump it down to the platform. These are in operation at St Paul\u0027s, Victoria station, Oxford Circus and Green Park. TfL aims to have air conditioned trains coming into operation on the deep underground lines by 2030. A spokeswoman told : We completely understand that travelling can be uncomfortable during periods of hot weather and are investing millions of pounds to make the Tube and buses cooler for customers.  We are constantly working on new ways to keep the temperature down on the Tube and have doubled the number of fans on the network since 2012 as well as installing chiller units to pump in cold air.   There are also 192 air conditioned trains serving 40 per cent of the network. All of our buses have opening windows and all new double-deck buses use air cooling systems.  During this hot weather we advise customers to ensure they have water with them when they travel in order to stay hydrated.”  Meanwhile, the Evening Standard reported on the scorching temperatures on London\u0027s buses with temperatures as hot as pizza ovens.  Those travelling on the top deck of buses faced similar temperatures to the Central Line with highs of 34C. Viliana Rankova, 28, told the newspaper that her commute was “like hell”.

It was a devastating moment for both mum and daughter as Fiona prepared to fall into a deep drug-induced sleep from which she expected to never wake. The terminally ill 31-year-old had bravely opted for medication to relieve her agonising pain that she knew, as a side effect, would result in sedation.  Determined to not be a vegetable after cancer snatched away her ability to move, eat or drink, she had told her mum: \u0027I really want to die with dignity.  But devastatingly, Fiona did not get her wish. Instead of \u0027sleeping\u0027 peacefully until she took her final breaths, as hoped, she woke up just 20 minutes later. And for the next four days, she continued to wake. Confused and scared, she would scream out in pain as her loved ones and doting nurses tried to comfort her.  Each time, Susan would say another \u0027last goodbye\u0027 to her daughter, who had told medics she did not want to be fed or watered while receiving end-of-life care. But it was only after SEVEN, gut-wrenching farewells that Fiona eventually died at The Margaret Centre at Whipps Cross Hospital in east London on May 1. Now, weeks on from her death, her mum is campaigning for assisted dying - and insists she would have helped her daughter to end her own life, if possible. We must have said our goodbyes six or seven times until she finally passed away, said Susan, who described Fiona\u0027s treatment as \u0027terminal sedation\u0027. She underwent five days of continual waking and pain. Every time she fell asleep, we thought that would be it. It would be very upsetting - then she\u0027d wake up again. At one point, she woke up and was thirsty. I gave her a drink and she said. \u0027Mum, stop trying to keep me alive.\u0027 It was scary for her as well. It\u0027s not what she wanted. It was torturous.  She added: It was more difficult [for Fiona] because she was having to say goodbyes to everybody again and again and again. There was no peace of mind. Even the nurses and doctors at the hospice were in distress as there was nothing further they could do to ease her suffering. Continuous deep sedation, often labelled \u0027terminal sedation\u0027 or \u0027palliative sedation\u0027 by relatives, has been used for decades to relieve the suffering of the terminally ill. The hospice says while it increased Fiona\u0027s sedation to relieve her agitation as safely as it could, she did experience some consciousness in her final days. Although the young woman was not given food or liquid at this time, in accordance with her wishes, her mouth and lips were kept moist by hospice nurses. She was also given medication to relieve her unbearable pain. But despite medics\u0027 best efforts to care for her at the facility in Leytonstone, they could not stop her excruciating suffering - because of the law, her mum said.  [The doctors] didn\u0027t use the words \u0027terminal sedation\u0027 said Susan, who was joined at the hospice by Fiona\u0027s dad, Clive Strong, and devoted boyfriend, Alex Paxton. She claimed: They said to Fi, \u0027We could sedate you and you wouldn\u0027t wake up after about four hours and eventually just stay asleep.\u0027 The mum-of-two, 61, is now fighting for compassionate euthanasia in a bid to prevent hundreds of others from going through the same ordeal Fiona did. If she was well enough I\u0027d have taken her to Dignitas in Switzerland, she said. She was screaming out all the time, even with all that pain relief. It was just awful. All she wanted to do was keep her dignity in tact and be pain-free. We would not allow an animal to suffer like this. She added: Fiona was so stoic and brave but how she died was so unnecessary.  Assisted dying is illegal in the UK, but a Mirror poll this week found three out of four Brits would support a law change to allow it. They want people with a terminal illness who have six months or less to live to be given the right to decide when they die.   Fiona was first diagnosed with the rare and aggressive childhood cancer rhabdomyosarcoma - a type of soft tissue sarcoma - in October 2015. She had been complaining of headaches, a numb face and nausea for weeks, but it was only after her eye began protruding that a tumour was discovered in her paranasal sinuses. They told her it was a tumour and to prepare for cancer, Susan added. They had to do a biopsy to test whether it was the disease. After undergoing a biopsy at St George\u0027s Hospital in Tooting, south London, Fiona, then 28, returned to her Leytonstone home, where she was constantly sick. It was the tumour pressing on her brain causing her to be sick, her mum explained. We didn\u0027t sleep all night. As the sickness grew worse, Fiona ended up being admitted to hospital, where she was later told the news she and her family had feared.  The consultant came in and said, \u0027Unfortunately, it\u0027s a very rare type of cancer. It usually affects children but is very unusual in adults\u0027, Susan said. I was in bits, I was devastated. Fiona, who worked for a market research company, was told the tumour was in an awkward position, located in the bone and sinus behind her right eye. For the next 14 months, she underwent treatment at The Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, including gruelling rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She suffered facial paralysis and spent her 29th birthday in intensive care battling sepsis - but faced it all with humour, dignity and incredible courage. Fiona gave the disease the respect it deserved but she didnt let it define her. She didn\u0027t want to be the person who was talking about her illness, Susan said. Despite her own struggles, Fiona also went out of her way to help others, raising more than \u0026pound10,000 for cancer charities and donating her brunette hair to the Little Princess Trust. And in January 2017, she was given something she had dreamed of - the all-clear.  But tragically, after only four months of remission, her eye started playing up again and doctors told her that a new cancerous tumour had been found. Despite undergoing further chemotherapy, radiotherapy, a clinical trial and even surgery to remove her eye at Moorfields Eye Hospital, the disease spread. Before long, Fiona\u0027s tumour had invaded both her brain and her nose, making it difficult for her to breathe - with the cancer also in her neck, shoulder and spine. A nurse was coming to the house to give her pain relief, Susan said. They said, \u0027I think we should get her to a hospice\u0027. In constant pain, Fiona was admitted to The Margaret Centre on April 9, where she was joined by mostly elderly patients and a team of compassionate nurses. She was on so many drugs, but they still couldn\u0027t control the pain, Susan said. She said to me, \u0027I\u0027m going to give it till April 27. If I don\u0027t feel any better, I want you to help me end my life. Take me to Switzerland or something\u0027. Before her admission, Fiona\u0027s loved ones had begun raising more than \u0026pound100,000 for immunotherapy treatment which would have started later that month.  They raised a whopping \u0026pound43,000 of their target, and despite her rapidly deteriorating condition, the young woman vowed to give it one last shot. Fiona said, \u0027even if immunotherapy gives me a few weeks extra\u0027, Susan said. She had a network of friends who were absolutely incredible. But unfortunately, Fiona, who loved scuba diving, travelling and socialising with pals, never got the chance to undergo immunotherapy. To her and her family\u0027s horror, her cancer was growing too quickly. She had lost all mobility in her legs, couldn\u0027t walk, could partially move her neck... the tumour was growing so much it had grown into her neck, her mum said. Her tongue was swollen so she was finding it difficult to speak and eat. In late April, doctors asked Fiona what she wanted to happen. She said, \u0027I really want to die with dignity\u0027, I don\u0027t want to be a vegetable where I can\u0027t speak. I can\u0027t move and I\u0027ve got no quality of life,\u0027 Susan said.  Fiona was told she could undergo end-of-life treatment to relieve her distress which, as a side effect, would cause her to fall into a \u0027deep sleep\u0027, according to her mum. She said that\u0027s what she wanted, she said. The young woman agreed to the treatment - involving syringe drivers and no food or water - which she hoped would leave her sedated until her eventual death. We all sat around her bed and said our goodbyes. We thought that that was going to be it. But it never happened... she kept waking up, Susan said. In some ways it was alarming because we were pleased she\u0027d woken up selfishlessly. It was like a rollercoaster. She claimed that even the doctors and nurses were left stunned. Fiona would say something poignant about us all, it was quite distressing, said Susan, who is divorced from her daughter\u0027s dad and now with partner Steve, 62. We\u0027d think \u0027well that\u0027s it\u0027. And then she\u0027d wake up. The nurses were in tears. In her final hours, Fiona\u0027s breathing became laboured and she started suffering from blood clots in her mouth, which caused her to gurgle.  The nurses had to use a suction pump to take them out, her mum said. She added: She then started making a noise as if she was calling me but couldn\u0027t speak. I got up and held her hand. She couldn\u0027t talk but she was aware I was there. The nurse said her breathing was getting shallower. Soon after, the young woman took her last breaths. She finally passed away on the Tuesday morning, said Susan, who moved down South from her home in Fife, Scotland, to care for Fiona. At the end of the day I didn\u0027t want to lose Fiona,but I didn\u0027t want her to be in pain. She definitely should\u0027ve been allowed to end her own life. It wasn\u0027t what we imagined at all. She added she was pleased with the results from the Mirror poll on assisted dying. I think there should be a nationwide poll for it, she said. Patients have got a responsibility to themselves. Ultimately, it\u0027s your body. She continued:  People are still going to die at the end of the day. In this day and age, we have to be more open-minded about death.  Addressing concerns about relaxing euthanasia rules, the mum said she believes patients should have to sign a detailed document about their treatment. We shouldn\u0027t be a passive patient, said Susan, who is currently staying at a friend\u0027s house, as she sorts out Fiona\u0027s belongings and flat. You\u0027d have to be aware of what you were getting, it would need to be open. There could even be a medical card, like there has been with organ donation. She added:Fiona\u0027s quality of life had diminished drastically by the end. There does have to be a degree of dignity. We can keep people alive but it\u0027s wrong to keep them alive if they are suffering things so great. I wouldn\u0027t want my worst enemy to go through what Fiona went through. Critics have said relaxing assisted dying laws would put pressure on vulnerable people to end their lives out of fear of being a financial, emotional and care burden. However, campaign organisation Dignity in Dying says terminally ill adults such as Fiona should have the right to die on their own terms.

Stephen Gee crept into his neighbour\u0027s garden armed with a bladed weapon which he used to slash a hole in the metal wall of the pool, causing 4,000 litres of water to gush out. The 63-year-old had become fed up with the noise made by Jason Little\u0027s children when using the 10m long pool.  So the retired aircraft engineer staged a nighttime raid to sabotage it - and was caught in CCTV footage.  Mr Little, a decorated army major, and his wife Avril were away at the time and when they returned to their \u0026pound600,000 home they found their pool empty and their garden flooded. When Mr Little reviewed the video from his hidden CCTV camera, he found footage of his hooded neighbour taken at 4.30am, tiptoeing up his garden path, past his herbaceous border and towards his pool. Gee disappeared behind the structure for 16 seconds before re-emerging and sneaking back to his house.  Although Gee had left a note in the Littles\u0027 porch explaining how he had woken in the night to the sound of flowing water and found their garden flooded, Mr Little called the police. A court heard that the attack was the culmination of a four year dispute between the neighbours over the noise made when the Littles\u0027 children used the pool. Mr Little, who won the Military Cross for displaying inspirational leadership in battle in Afghanistan in 2008, had moved into a large detached house in the Dorset village of Puxey in 2012 with his family. Although the oval swimming pool, which measured 10m by 4m, was already installed, his new neighbours soon took offence to his children using it. Mr Little, 46, told the court: The pool was already there when we moved in and we started using it. Almost immediately they seemed to take offence to the fact we have children and the children make noise. Whenever they used the swimming pool, they shouted over the fence at them and would play loud music and stare at them. Before we had CCTV things happened to the swimming pool that I couldn\u0027t explain, so we had cameras installed to the rear of the property.  Mr Little said they hadn\u0027t used the pool that summer of 2016 but he had carried out maintenance and checks so the children could start using it again. He checked the pool before he left to go away on the weekend of June 19, 2016 and the water level was full and there was no leak. The CCTV camera hidden on a conservatory to cover the back garden showed Gee stood behind the pool for 16 seconds before leaving the garden. PC Charlotte Goddard told Poole Magistrates\u0027 Court it looked like the wall of the pool had been hit hard with something heavy and the cut was wider at one end, like an axe blade or similar had hit it. She said that in the CCTV footage it looked like Gee was carrying something heavy in his right hand as he approached the pool, although it is not clear what. The cost of the damage ran to \u0026pound1,500, although Mr Little said he claimed it through his house insurance and only had to pay the \u0026pound250 excess. Gee, who worked in the aviation industry for 25 years, pleaded not guilty to criminal damage.

Eloise Parry, 21, from Shrewsbury, died in hospital on April 12 2015 after taking eight tablets containing the poisonous Dinitrophenol (DNP). Bernard Rebelo was sentenced at Inner London Crown Court on Friday. The 31-year-old, from Gosport in Hampshire, was previously convicted of two counts of manslaughter and one of placing unsafe food on the market. Miss Parry\u0027s mother Fiona Parry said her daughter had many problems in life but that there had been positive signs that things were changing for the better.  I had hoped that somehow they would be sorted, she said in a statement read to the court. She said her daughter had a number of plans for her future, including her degree, career and to travel the world. When Eloise died her life was undone and her possible future unravelled and in that moment the hope I had for her was also destroyed, she added. Rebelo admitted while giving evidence during the trial that he sold DNP to Miss Parry. He told the jury that he included a warning on his website that the substance was not for human consumption.  Rebelo\u0027s girlfriend Mary Roberts, 32, was cleared by the jury of one count of money laundering after she was accused of transferring \u0026pound20,000 for and on behalf of Rebelo. Ms Roberts said she had never seen capsules for making pills where she lived and if she had she would have asked her partner Rebelo why they were there. She also said she had taken little interest in asking details of a business Rebelo had set up to sell muscle enhancing supplements and protein shakes. The couple wept in the dock as the verdicts were delivered on Wednesday afternoon, with Rebelo asking the judge: Can I see my daughter? Ms Roberts could be heard crying as the couple hugged one another. The jury began its deliberations on Tuesday afternoon.  Miss Parry died after taking eight diet pills containing the highly toxic DNP. Her sister Rebecca Parry, now aged 19, said in a statement read out during the trial that she had been focused on losing weight. She noted that in the weeks and months leading up to her death, her sister had struggled more and more with her eating disorder. She said: The diet pills she had taken had made her lose a drastic amount of weight but she still wanted to be slimmer. Rebecca Parry said she left Eloise\u0027s house on April 11 at about 9pm and that her sister, who had been talking about doing a Master\u0027s degree, seemed happy but tired. She had leg pain. Rebecca said: She mentioned a takeaway but I told her not to order one unless she was sure she could eat it.

Just where did the newly-weds jet off on their secret two-week honeymoon? Some experts have been hedging their bets on the southern African country of Namibia as the destination of choice. Speculation had also been been rife about Jasper Lake in Canada, due to the fact the country has a special place in Meghan\u0027s heart because she lived in Toronto. Other hotly-tipped contenders were Italy, Jamaica and the Caribbean.  And Botswana in Africa was another in the running as the prince has often spoken about his love for Africa, a place he regularly visits as part of his role as patron of a rhino conservation. It\u0027s where the couple also enjoyed a romantic break last year for Meghan\u0027s 36th birthday. But this week, Prince Harry set the record straight (sort of) when asked about the mystery destination. During post-award drinks, following the Queen\u0027s Young Leaders Awards Ceremony on Tuesday, he was asked by Mavis Elias , a philanthropist from Namibia, if she went to her country for his honeymoon.  And in just six words, he quashed the rumour and said: No, we didn\u0027t go to Namibia. The 33-year-old added, gesturing to the media listening: I\u0027m not going to say where. So looks like the destination is going to stay shrouded in mystery, but at least we can narrow the list down. What we do know is Prince William and Kate Middleton\u0027s honeymoon location was ultimately revealed to be the Seychelles. Prince Charles and Princess Diana went to Scotland before embarking on a 12-day cruise through the Greek Islands to Egypt on the Royal Yacht.

Her new book was branded “tawdry” over supposed revelations by servants about the monarch’s love life. Lady Colin also came under fire for writing about 97-year-old Philip’s health. The former I’m a Celebrity star claims royal staff spilled intimate details of the Queen and her husband’s first night together at their retreat in Broadlands, Hampshire. She also alleges the monarch was left devastated after the late Princess Margaret spread rumours about Philip having affairs. The claims, in her book The Queen’s Marriage and which we have chosen not to reveal in full, sparked fury.  Former BBC Royal \u0026shyCorrespondent Jennie Bond said: “I don’t see any need to discuss the Queen’s love life and marriage. “It’s distasteful, unnecessary and tawdry.” Ex-royal butler Paul Burrell added: “Anyone can make up these claims. You can only be a true, \u0026shyreliable witness to history if you are there. Lady Colin Campbell was none of those things. She is writing about our Head of State, our Head of Church and someone who she does not know. She is writing about someone who she is not familiar with. “I stood beside her and lived with her for 11 years and I can tell you who the Queen is. She is a good, kind Christian lady and she should not be defiled in this way because she is above that. “She has earned our respect as a nation and things like that should not be written.”  Speaking about Philip’s health concerns, Burrell said: “It’s none of her business. She shouldn’t be writing about his medical records, that’s \u0026shyunethical and wrong. “It’s out of bounds and off-limits. It shouldn’t be in the public domain.” Lady Campbell – who wrote a shocking biography about Princess Diana – claimed the servants were “full of talk” about the Queen and her husband’s bedroom antics after their wedding in November 1947. The 68-year-old alleges the duke confided in friend and best man David Michael Mountbatten about their night together. It is said he told another cousin the Queen was “beautiful”. Lady Campbell claims Philip spoke about his health problems during a party two years ago.

First, how exactly do you pronounce the word \u0027scone\u0027? Should it rhyme with \u0027gone\u0027 or \u0027bone\u0027? And secondly, should you put the jam first, and then the cream (like in Cornwall), or cream and then jam (like in Devon). Cream teas have been served in the UK since the 11th century, so it\u0027s a debate that has raged for hundreds of years. Wars have surely been fought over less. We\u0027re certainly not going to risk the wrath of half the country by siding one way or the other, but here\u0027s what the stats say - and which way The Queen falls on the argument  Scone or scone A poll by YouGov seems to have settled the debate once and for all. Their research revealed that most Britons (51%) pronounce it to rhyme with “gone” with around four in ten (42%) rhyming it with “bone.” YouGov believe the two key factors are region and social grade. They said: Those living in the North (60%) and Scotland (80%) overwhelmingly use the “gone” pronunciation, while those in the Midlands (56%) and London (50%) are much more likely to go with the “bone” option. The survey also shows that class is as important a factor in how “scone” is said, although maybe not in the way you’d expect. Those in the C2DE social grade (working class) are evenly split, with 45% going with the “bone” pronunciation and 46% going with “gone”. However, among ABC1s there is a very real split. The middle classes are far more likely to go with the “gone” option (55%) than “bone (“40%). Jam first or cream first? There\u0027s two schools of thought here - the Cornish method of spreading jam on the scone and putting a dollop of cream on top, or the Devon method of cream first, then jam YouGov found that 61% favour having their jam first and then cream. Meanwhile just 21% went with cream first.  What has the Queen got to say? The Queen is the most famous Brit on the planet, and she hosts a lot of tea parties, so she\u0027s probably a good person to settle the debate. A former royal chef revealed how her Majesty enjoys her scones at Buckingham Palace garden parties - and the news could anger Devonians. Darren McGrady, who was the personal chef to Elizabeth, II, Princess Diana and Princes William and Harry for 15 years, made the revelation on Twitter. He wrote: Jam first or Clotted Cream first? Jam first at Buckingham Palace garden parties!   Sausage rolls replace pork pies as \u0027snack barometer\u0027 to measure Brits cost of living  He later added: The Queen always had home-made Balmoral jam first (@tiptree little scarlet when we ran out) with clotted cream on top at Buckingham Palace garden parties in the Royal tea tent and all Royal tea parties. Some Twitter users agreed with the royal protocol, with one simply writing: The Queen is right. However, others were seemingly outraged. A user called Gavin tweeted: Refuse to believe that the Queen puts jam before clotted cream on her scones. That’s just plain wrong! When firms get it wrong As one of Britain\u0027s most contentious issues, officially coming out on one side or the other can get you in a lot of trouble online. Especially if your restaurant is in Cornwall and you show a picture of a Devon cream tea. Lanhydrock restaurant in Bodmin, Cornwall, infuriated Cornish locals after its Mother\u0027s Day advert displayed a cream tea made the Devon way, Cornwall Live reported. The image, shared by a National Trust site in Cornwall, was also branded unacceptable and shocking, with some Trust members even threatening to cancel their subscriptions.

The 19-year-old, who goes by the name of Gracelyn White, dates older, married men for money. Her dates range from handsome, wealthy, CEOs in their 30s to \u0027old, fat and disgusting\u0027 men who she claims push her for sexual favours or try to cajole her into threesomes with other girls. Men have tried to invite Gracelyn away on holidays in the south of France, gifted her Christian Louboutin shoes and paid her \u0026pound300 just to have tea with them, she says. And she has now revealed to Mirror that a simple bar of soap - carried by your lover in a bag to work - could be the tell-tale sign that they are having an affair. Gracelyn said: One man told me that he\u0027s always careful not to use the soap in a hotel when he showers after having sex with someone other than his wife so that she cannot smell a foreign scent when he gets home. I\u0027m not sure if he brings his own soap or if he just uses water but carrying soap could indicate that your husband is sleeping with other people, she said. To catch a cheater, Gracelyn also advised that women scrutinise their husband\u0027s finances which could unearth a sugar baby affair or pay a surprise afternoon visit to your partner as lunchtime is her married benefactors\u0027 preferred time for an illicit meeting.  Track their money and check if they are bringing extra clothes to work with them because they sometimes tell me that they changed before our date. Or surprise your husband at lunch time, because married men usually wanted to meet at lunch time. Also, most men pay me in envelopes, so if you find an envelope at home or in the car that should not be there, that could be a sign that he is cheating. Checking their online activity is also a good way of confirming any suspicions, she said. If I was a wife and my husband was making a lot of money, and if I had a thought that he might be cheating on me, I would make a fake profile of a young girl to check if he is on the site, she said. Gracelyn claims that she has been offered \u0026pound4,000 to have sex with her \u0027dates\u0027 but said she is a virgin and is saving herself for her future true love. She said that a need for money drove her to dating for cash.  She explained: I left school when I was 16. My mum had cancer and I thought we needed money to help her through chemotherapy so I got a full-time job. By the time I was 18 I was tired. I did not want to work and I thought there must be more to life. I heard about \u0027sugar baby\u0027 sites, where men pay to spend time with younger women in exchange for money, gifts and a luxurious lifestyle and I thought this sounded like easy money. I didn\u0027t realise at the time that they also expect sex. When I had my first \u0027sugar date\u0027 with a sugar daddy, I understood what it really meant and there was no way I was not going to sleep with them so my idea of being a sugar baby did not work out. Instead I found a site which was full of interesting people. Men would send you an offer to take you out on a date. Usually, the offer is \u0026pound100 but sometimes they pay a lot more. I have been paid \u0026pound300 for a date. And that was just a date, without kissing or anything else. So I started dating rich men for money. Gracelyn, who lives in London, said that the men she dates are all very different but the one common denominator between almost all of them is that they are married.  And sometimes her \u0027dates\u0027 get verbally abusive when she refuses their suggestions of \u0027arrangements\u0027 - sugar baby code for sex. The men I met through the site were looking for escort girls or sugar babies, although this site was meant to be a dating site. I would tell them that the first date was to get to know each other and, if we got along, then on future dates we could think about arrangements. I set rules that they can\u0027t even touch me on the first date but they would still ask me over and over for sex which was annoying. I usually block them after the first date, but if they behaved well I would sometimes allow a second date as well. There was this one man, we had interesting conversations and he behaved well so I agreed to a second date. But when I told him there would still be no touching he texted me and said \u0027I was a gentleman...I thought that would impress you enough for you to consider having a sexy date with me?\u0027 Well, he was fat and old, so that was a disgusting message. We did not have the second date.  Another man asked me if I would have a second date and said he could bring a girl with him, that I might be attracted to. That was so funny because he seemed to be the most boring person in the universe, I would never think that he was planning threesomes with young girls. Despite the inherent dangers of meeting strangers who are looking for sex, Gracelyn said that she has not been physically attacked but she is careful to always meet in a public place and to sit opposite - and never next to her dates - so that they cannot easily touch her. I feel a bit disgusting about what I\u0027m doing. Sometimes I want to text the men beforehand to cancel but I need the money.  But it\u0027s given me material to write a book , which I hope will sell so that I can promote another book I wrote, called \u0027My Lifetime Book\u0027.  I\u0027m actually really innocent and I believe in romance and true love. I\u0027ve never had a boyfriend - I\u0027ve never even kissed a boy on the mouth before. The most I have done is hugged someone on a date because I think that\u0027s just polite. I had one date who was 19 or 20. He was a student spending his parents money. But usually the men range from their 30s to their 60s and most of them are in their 40s. One man had a daughter who was 20. She was older than I was. On the first date, he was telling me about his daughter and I started to mention that she was older then me, and that was so awkward. He really did not want to hear that. There was this other old person who was asking me to meet his other sugar babies, and one of them was in her 30s, so that was weird. What did he expect for us to do together? Gracelyn says her experience has shown her that some old men with money are disgusting explaining: You say no to them and they still ask for sexual favours. And overall the married men were disgusting, some of them would tell me that the wife is home with their kids. I would think \u0027you should be home, helping your wife look after the kids, not be on a date with some young girl\u0027. But I am not a home wrecker. I would have this one date with the married people because they would not get what they wanted from me, like sex, but I would take their money, so I was a winner. I was a bad experience because I was a waste of their time and money so maybe after me they would quit the site. People might think that it is bad that I was dating married men. Well, I don\u0027t think so, because if it was not me, it would be someone else. And for wives who will be reading this, maybe after this story, you might be more careful of what your husband is really doing. The people on the site usually were rich businessmen or lawyers but some people weren\u0027t rich and they would try to negotiate the price which is strange because there are lots of free dating sites.  The book, I Took Your Desperate Dad\u0027s and Husband\u0027s Money is available on Amazon here .  Track your husband\u0027s finances. Affairs can be expensive and there is almost always a money trail.  Pay a surprise visit to your husband at lunctime. Married men arrange many of their \u0027dates\u0027 during their lunch break.  Make a fake online profile and check for your husband on dating sites. Watch out for empty envelopes. The majority of men pay Gracelyn in envelopes so if you find an envelope at home or in the car it could be a warning sign. Check if your husband is bringing extra clothes to work. Gracelyn\u0027s dates sometimes change before they meet her.  Does your husband bring a wash-bag or soap to work? Gracelyn said that some of her dates are very careful not use hotel soap after \u0027arrangements\u0027 with other girls.

The heatwave has brought record-breaking temperatures for four days in a row this week and it\u0027s going to stay hot for the foreseeable future. There will be highs of 29C across the country but there is the low risk of thunderstorms across the west country towards the western and southern parts of Wales. But the hot weather won\u0027t end this weekend with high temperatures continuing into next week. Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said high pressure is firmly anchored over the UK with clear skies and high temperatures forecast for the foreseeable future.   He said: The fine weather will continue into next week.  There is a low risk of thundery influence on Sunday throughout the day and into the evening. But if it does happen, it will just be a temporary blip and won\u0027t mark the end of the good weather.  The forecast looks clear and there\u0027s no rain forecast for the time being. Met weather forecaster Alex Deakin said temperatures will continue to rise throughout Friday.   He said: “It’s a bit grey to start with across parts of the east, but for most dry and sunny and temperatures set to soar perhaps not quite as high as recent days. “Every day of this working week we’ve seen the highest temperatures of the year so far, we might not beat that through Friday. The cloud is most likely to be found in northern areas at the start of the day, but for most, it will be warm from the early morning. “It’s quite grey and misty around the coast of northern Scotland down the eastern side too.  “There’s some of this low cloud just drifting into parts of eastern England. “But for most, it’s another beautiful start to the day, lots and lots of blue sky, just a bit more of a breeze blowing along the south coast perhaps. “It’s already pretty warm at eight o’clock in the morning and temperatures are only going to climb through the day with the help of that sunshine which will also help the mist and low cloud to move back to the coast across eastern Scotland. “For most it is blue skies, and as I say it’s all about those temperatures rising.”    It will be slightly cooler in Scotland and along the east coast while areas in Northern Ireland, Wales and southern England will experience some of the highest temperatures.  He added: “Saturday morning could again start with a bit of low cloud across the east. “Overall, that will clear and the main message for the weekend: lots more sunshine. Hot, but not quite as hot.”  As the heatwave continues, water companies have been urging customers to conserve water by opting just four-minute long showers.

Zephanie Woodward was forced to bail out of vehicle after just 30 minutes as the temperature shot up to 46\u0026degC. The potentially deadly temperatures inside the mum-of-two\u0027s car were recorded even with one of the windows open very slightly. The 35-year-old, who works in Bridgend, South Wales, was equipped for the experiment with a thermometer and the stopwatch on her mobile. The clip shows the car thermometer recording a temperature outside on Wednesday afternoon of 31\u0026degC.  Zephanie posted the clip to Shepherds Veterinary Hospital’s Facebook page, where she works as a director.  She said: “In this video I experience what it must be like when a dog is left in a car.  “I couldn\u0027t believe the temperatures that were reached, and came out feeling pretty unwell. Please think about your pets in this heatwave.”  Talking to the camera, she says: “I thought I would come and have a little sit in my car and decide how it must feel for the dogs being left in the car and see how long I can cope with it.”  After seven minutes in the car, Zephanie tells viewers: “I feel like I’ve got a little bit of a sweat on, I’m certainly glad I’m not a dog wearing a fur coat.” At this point the temperature outside the car is still at 31\u0026degC but after seven minutes the car’s internal temperature has already jumped to just under 38\u0026degC. Zephanie admits she feels ok at the point, but when the clip jumps forward to 12 minutes of being inside the car - the temperature inside has jumped to 41\u0026degC She tells viewers: “I am sweating now. If I was a dog I would be panting away, and therefore losing water. I’d be needing a drink.  “It’s approaching the point where I am definitely uncomfortable.” When Zephanie gets to 21 minutes inside the car she admits that she is “melting” as the temperature jumps up to nearly 44 degrees. (111F) When Zephanie gets to a full 30-minutes in the car she is visibly red-faced and sweaty. Zephanie brings her temperature gauge up to the camera and shows that it has reached a staggering 46 degrees (114F). The vet says: “I have had enough. I’m getting out of here. I’m pretty convinced if I was a dog you would probably come in to find me collapsed at the bottom of your car. “So please, don’t forget. Dog’s die in hot cars.” On social media, Hel L Rosser (corr) said: “Well done Zephanie for highlighting the stupidity of leaving a dog locked in a vehicle for any length of time in hot temperatures. Having had the misfortune to have had my dog collapse with heat exhaustion, not by being in a locked car, it is the most horrendous thing to witness.” Gillian Tatchell added:”You deserve a medal for your effort sitting in your car. Hopefully people will realise how quickly temperature rises. Well done.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman relives tragic moment tried","story":"NewsWoman relives tragic moment she tried to save man from drowning in Manchester reservoirThe 20-year-old has become the third person to die after swimming in Manchester reservoirs this month\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNeal KeelingDave Burke14:58, 29 JUN 2018NewsPolice were called to the reservoir to reports of a man in difficulty in the water (Image: Manchester Evening News)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young man has died after going swimming in a reservoir, despite a desperate rescue by passersby.

The man was taken to hospital from Audenshaw Reservoir yesterday, but was later declared dead.  Describing the tragedy, Becky Stokes, who bravely tried to save him, wrote on Facebook : Today I witnessed a 20 year old boy drown in audenshaw reservoir, myself and an older male swam in after him but he had already gone under and couldn’t see anything under the water with how dark it is.  The rescue service managed to get his body out of the water.

And what\u0027s more refreshing than a Fanta Lemon? (Or a Fanta Lim\u0026oacuten, if you\u0027re on holiday in Europe). This might be why panic began to spread yesterday on social media when it was announced Fanta Lemon is being discontinued. People took to Twitter in their droves to express how gutted they were - and you could say some were a tad dramatic...   Some thought the combination of Love Island drama and their favourite drink being taken away from them was all too much to bear.   There was also a lot of swearing going on. One dismayed Twitter user said: First they charge lucozade, then irn bri (sic), now they’re f***ing discontinuing Fanta lemon, wits next no more green milk??? Another said: what the f*** as if fanta lemon has been discontinued honestly what am i even living for anymore cba   But this is a prime example of rumours and false information getting out of hand on social media - because while it is being discontinued in the US, it\u0027s not actually going to affect us British citrus lovers.  The official Fanta Twitter account sprung into action this morning to console any annoyed UK-based fizzy drink fans, apologising for the confusion the whole debacle has caused.   So there you go, you can still enjoy that refreshing tang - this has all got us feeling a bit thirsty.

First came the \u0027dab\u0027, then the \u0027mannequin challenge\u0027, but the latest hit dance craze is the \u0027floss\u0027. The quirky dance originated in America but has now become a sensation on school playgrounds worldwide - even footballers are giving it a go. It involves moving your arms from side-to-side, moving one behind your back as if you are flossing, before switching sides. However not everyone seems to think the childish dance is all fun and games, as one mum has discovered.  A parent has taken to MumsNet to share her frustration at learning her son\u0027s school is handing out punishments to anyone caught \u0027flossing\u0027.    Going by the username, purpleshimmer, the mum said: I\u0027ve just been reading on my Facebook and it seems my child\u0027s school has decided to give out detentions to any child caught doing the floss dance or any other dance from the Fortnite game.  How bloody silly is this? Fair enough if the kids are doing it in class but detentions are being given out to anyone doing it at any time! Seriously?? The mum admitted that her son is always doing the dance at home and that she had even tried (and failed) to do it herself. World has gone mad, she added. There\u0027s nothing harmful in it whatsoever... but because it\u0027s from a game that isn\u0027t \u0027age appropriate\u0027 it is being banned in school.  Other mums were equally shocked by the school\u0027s decision to hand out detentions. One said: It does seem to irritate adults (including me) a lot. But I can\u0027t see a good reason for banning it during breaks and lunch time, so detention for doing it any time does seem, on the face of it, unreasonable. Another wrote: I think it\u0027s a bit daft to give detention for it if it\u0027s being done at play time - who does it hurt, after all? A third commented: They should not be doing it in class or on way to class or dinner queues, but detention for playing at play time seems harsh.  However not everyone was in agreement. Lots of users thought the dance was rather annoying and encouraged the ban. I don\u0027t blame them, read a comment. It\u0027s infuriating when they\u0027re jiggling about doing it and not listening or doing what they\u0027ve been asked.

Footage from Taigan Safari Park in Crimea shows a family, including a child, driving without even windows for protection before getting up and close with the fearsome cats. Lioness Lola goes for a cuddle with one of the group as he sits in an open-sided vehicle, just inches from a child. The beast is pulled away by world famous lion whisperer Oleg Zubkov, 50, owner of the park, with his bare hands. The lioness also sought to cuddle a young woman who moved away as Zubkov, seen in the green shirt,pulled her away.  The untethered animal - rescued two years ago from being put down by a private zoo in Russia - was reportedly “purring like a cat” although this is something lions are supposed not to be able to do. Two other unchained male lions are nearby as the video was shot. Zubkov allows visitors to mix with big cats in scenes that defy normal health and safety rules and would be forbidden elsewhere. “If a giant lioness jumps into your arms while you drive around Safari park, and purrs like a cat, then you can be sure that this is Lola from Chelyabinsk,” said Safari park director Tatiana Aleksagina. “Life in the park has transformed her into one of the kindest wild animals we’ve seen. “She just gave birth to her first cub, a lioness we called Lilu, and she loves coming to say hello to tourists. “In fact, she is so passionate in jumping into safari bus with kisses and hugs that many tourists can’t handle it. They can’t believe that all Lola wants to do is kiss and hug.”  She had been neglected at a zoo which was poised to put her down because they couldn’t afford to feed her. When Lola arrived at the park she was hostile to people. But she was eventually tamed by Zubkov, who insists his animals will not harm tourists and that they are safe if accompanying him. The lioness was rescued by Karen Dallakyan, a vet and animal shelter owner in Chelyabinsk. “Lola was in horrible condition after being fed with too much cheap cooked meals like porridge,” he said. “A huge tummy didn’t let her jump, and her joints ached from carrying extra weight. “She had to go through a strict diet and in a matter of weeks she started to move around and jump, like any young animal is supposed to do.

They were expecting a turnout of 20 people, in the end there were nearly 30.“I had traffic waiting to the left, right and behind me.”Pictures taken at the Broughty Ferry Lifeboat station include a crew photo and shots of coxswain Murray Brown, lifeboat navigator Fiona Johnston, lifeboat shore crew Sandra Chalmers and mechanic Scott Huggins.Colin Davidson, a spokesman for RNLI Broughty Ferry, said the crew found taking part in the photographs a great experience.He said: “As well as being fun to be part of, the crews were also given an insight into the history of photography.“The photographs developed from the shoot allowed the crews to see how they would have looked a long time ago, which caused interest and some amusement.“Broughty Ferry RNLI station being built in 1909 also added character. We wish Jack all the best for the rest of his project.”To take the photo of the crew Jack had to stand in the middle of the road at the T-junction on Fort Street, causing traffic to come to a stop while he worked.To track Jack on his travels you can follow him on social media or via thelifeboatstationproject.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b34a8316ddeb-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee man gary 22 lived a tragic life but is now with his family","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe grieving family of a Dundee man found dead in prison have paid tribute to his “kind soul”.Gary Williamson, of Byron Street, was found unconscious on June 14 in his cell at HM Prison Perth.The 22-year-old, who was buried on Thursday, had been sentenced just a day earlier for breaching a previous bail condition.The Scottish Prison Service has said a fatal accident inquiry will be held into his death.His adopted mother, Mhairi Cameron, paid tribute to Gary who she said had a “bubbly” personality despite having lived a tragic life.Gary’s sister Catherine died from meningitis aged eight, before Gary was born.When he was six, his mum Margaret died having had stomach problems, and, six years later, his dad Charles died of a heart attack.Three months after that, his brother, Charles junior, known as “Chicky”, took his own life aged 29.With no immediate family left, Mhairi and her husband Peter – who is Gary’s cousin – adopted him and took him in aged 11.Mhairi, 35, said: “As hard as it is, I think he’s in a place he wants to be, with his family.“Although he lived a sad life he was full of life. But he was a bit of a lost soul with all the tragedy in his life. A lost soul, but a kind soul.”Former Craigie High School pupil Gary, who was a gardener, was laid to rest next to his brother and dad at Birkhill Cemetery following a service in the Hilltown.Mhairi said the police had alerted them that he was unwell but the family weren’t initially told how serious a condition he was in.She said: “The CID came to us about 3am on the Thursday. They told us at that point he was ill in Perth Royal Infirmary.“I had problems with my phone but when I got through to the hospital they told us how serious it was and to grab anyone close to him and to get there. We were told he wasn’t going to make it.”Mhairi said with no brain activity detected, medics told the family there was nothing they could do for him. His life support was switched off at 10.30am.She said: “I had to leave before they turned the machine off – I couldn’t be there for that. I said my goodbyes and Peter and I left.“We have been told it was a cardiac arrest, but they don’t know if there were drugs or something else involved. We have to wait for the toxicology report and then a fatal accident inquiry.”She added: “Gary never really got over Chicky dying. He never understood him leaving him like that, I don’t think.\u0026#8220I’ll remember his cheeky smile, especially when he was lying to you. He knew you knew he was lying and that would always bring a smile to his face. He knew how to make you laugh and would do anything for you.“Gary was bubbly, outgoing, really helpful. And he liked to party with his friends.“A lot of people will be lost without him. Loads of people have got in touch since he died.“There are tributes on Facebook from his pals but I haven’t watched the videos people have shared. I’m not ready to hear his voice again, yet.”Peter, 35, said: “Gary liked his young life, spending time with his friends. I had known him all his life with him being my cousin.“He was a troubled soul because he lost his family. He did some daft stuff but he had a heart of gold. You could make him happy short-term, but long-term, he had lost too much.“He never really got over his brother’s death, he couldn’t make sense of it. He loved being out working, outdoors, gardening, doing cladding, things like that.“It was obviously very emotional when he died. It still doesn’t seem real.”Mhairi added: “It hasn’t sunk in I don’t think. I don’t want to believe it’s real. I think it’s because we don’t know what happened to him.“Once we do, then hopefully we can get some closure.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1f819d44b02-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people customer base like a little community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tChoosing what to have for lunch in a bustling city centre can be a task, however, Brodie’s Takeaway has you covered.The blue-fronted shop on Bell Street is often the go-to place to grab a whole range of tasty homemade grub and it is all thanks to Cate and Ron Brodie who opened the shop almost 14 years ago.Cate said: “We already owned Brodie’s Coffee Shop in Forfar and we wanted to branch out and open another shop.“The premises we are in were already a takeaway when we took over.”After three years of running both businesses the couple decided to sell the coffee shop and focus on their Dundee business and their two children.Cate said: “We found with running two businesses and having two kids that we were just too widespread between the shops and we decided to sell the coffee shop.“It was a really hard decision to make, but with business you have to either go really big and hire managers or stay small and in control so that is what we have done.“It has also allowed us to get our weekends back to spend with our children.”Now the takeaway is thriving with masses of hungry locals heading in five days a week for the huge range of homemade food on offer.Cate appreciates though that the shop is in an ideal location with the High School of Dundee, Abertay University and the DC Thomson offices in close proximity and full of willing customers.“We have a huge amount of regulars now from all the local businesses.“The shop is now like a meeting point with everyone like a little community and we all know each other.“I also like to introduce people to each other while they are waiting in the queues for their food.“It is a way for them to network and meet new people and it’s also great for me getting to know everyone who comes in.”Now after more than a decade the owner couldn’t imagine not having the takeaway shop.“Although it is very hard work with my days lasting easily 12 hours and starting between 5-6am, I couldn’t imagine myself not having Brodie’s.“People may think it is easy, but there is a lot of work that goes on in the background that customers don’t see.Whatever you fancy to eat Brodie’s is more than likely to have it with an extensive menu ranging from homemade soups, sandwiches and burgers to daily specials including chicken curry and stovies, there is something for everyone.But owner Cate says it wouldn’t be possible without her three employees and her 81-year-old dad, Gordon Bruce.She said: “My dad is basically on call whenever we need him.

armstrong cash boost from celtic transfer to southampton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United won’t get their Stuart Armstrong windfall straight away but that will not affect their summer signing programme.The Tangerines are in line to receive six figures from Celtic when Armstrong completes an expected £6 million switch to English Premier League outfit Southampton this week.It’s because of a sell-on clause from the deal when the Scottish international left Tannadice for Parkhead back at the end of January 2015.Once the £1m plus the Hoops paid for him then is deducted, the cash heading to Tannadice is likely to be between £400,000 and half a million.While that will be more than welcome as United prepare for another money-losing season in the Championship, with the player’s likely move to England coming out of the blue, it is not something they budgeted for.That means the further signings being planned will not be hit by the fact Celtic do not have to pay up straight away and, if they choose, could stagger the payments over two or three years.What the money could become is a nice extra for manager Csaba Laszlo if he makes moves in the transfer market during the January window.Right now he is looking to put the finishing touches to rebuilding a squad that’s already seen eight new first-team players fixed up.He remains in the market for another striker and a central defender, in particular.Potential target Callum Morris completed a moved to second-tier rivals Ross County at the weekend – along with former Tannadice team-mate Keith Watson.Morris was still on a list of possible signings but after securing stopper Frederic Frans earlier this month, a footballing defender is being sought.Former striker David Goodwillie could complete a move from Clyde to Premiership new boys Livingston this week if the clubs can agree a fee.United were aware of his likely availability during the close season but, given his off-field issues, there was no chance of him being handed a third spell at Tannadice.Monday saw the players start their first full week of pre-season training at their St Andrews base.They are due to see action for the first time tomorrow week in a friendly at Brechin and more games are set to be pencilled in.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.126288.jpg ","title":"dundee united to get six figure sum as stuart armstrong completes move from celtic to southampton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are now guaranteed a six-figure windfall after former star Stuart Armstrong signed for Southampton.The Scotland midfielder has penned a four-year deal after completing his £7 million switch from Celtic.Under the terms of his 2015 moved from Tannadice to Parkhead, the Tangerines are due a chunk of that fee.That’s likely to see them land somewhere between £400,000 and £500,00, though the details of over what period that money comes in will have to be thrashed out with the Hoops.Armstrong’s future at Celtic Park had been in doubt after negotiations over a new contract had stalled, leaving Brendan Rodgers to cash in with just a year to run on his current deal.He was part of the side that won the ‘double treble’ under Rodgers and won a total of eight major trophies during his time at the club.He scored 17 times in 2016-17 and forced his way into the Scotland setup but struggled to replicate that form last season after an injury.Armstrong is manager Mark Hughes’ first signing of the summer window after Southampton narrowly survived relegation from the top flight of English football, and the former Stoke boss was keen to add the Scot’s creativity to a squad that scored just 37 goals last season.Hughes said: “Stuart is a player who we have admired for some time, and I am delighted we have been able to bring him here, especially given the competition we faced to sign him.“We have strong players in the squad and it is important we build on that by adding different qualities.“It is important we add a greater goal threat to the team as a whole, and to our midfield specifically, and Stuart’s record of scoring and creating makes him an extremely exciting addition in that area.“He brings with him extensive experience of European football and has developed his game impressively over the past few seasons at a major club in Celtic, where there is a demand not only to perform but also to win. Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals. I hope going forwards from here that it will be the same this term at St Mary’s.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee united coach ian cathro teams up with former boss at wolves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Hearts boss Ian Cathro has been appointed first-team coach of Premier League newcomers Wolves.Dundonian Cathro, who spent eight months at Tynecastle, was Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo’s assistant at Rio Ave in 2012 and at Valencia.The pair met on a Scottish Football Association coaching course in 2009.“I am very excited about joining Wolves and looking forward to working with a coach and staff I know, trust and believe in,” said Cathro.“All of us share the same footballing philosophy and that is such an important factor for a successful coaching team.“Wolves is a fantastic club with a rich history and lots of potential, and I can’t wait to get started.”Cathro, who began his coaching career at Dundee United, has also been assistant boss at Newcastle and met the Wolves squad on Wednesday.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32069b78095-490x564.jpg ","title":"football is a labour of love for refreshed dundee united coach craig easton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAnyone who’s come across him down the years will testify enthusiasm has never been an issue with new Dundee United reserve team manager Craig Easton.As far back as when he was part of the youth system he’s now spearheading, Craig’s huge appetite for the game was always apparent.Even he, though, admits a spell out of the game a couple of years back was a perfect reminder of just how good life in football is.It came when financial problems at Torquay United forced him into an unexpected move back to Scotland and left him searching for work.Not content to sit around waiting for his next job, Eastie ended up working in the building trade and admits it was one of the best moves he’s ever made.“I was in England for 12 years and I didn’t even think of coming back up to Scotland to be honest,” he said.“But in football you can’t plan what’s going to happen, especially as a player and then, when I was coaching, I found things could change as well.“I was with Torquay working with the U/19s and college kids. It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time. It’s about us then doing the extra wee bit to take them to the first team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b222ed15f5ad-847x564.jpg ","title":"more summer signings to come promises dundee gaffer mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann is delighted with the five summer signings he’s made so far and the Dundee boss is determined more will follow.Monday saw Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy fixed up on a two-year deal from Belgians Lokeren to join fellow-new boys Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph, Kharl Madianga and Elton Ngwatala in pre-season training.Neil felt it was import to get the bulk of his transfer business done as early as possible but his aim is to make more moves before the window slams shut at the end of August.“I hope to get one or two more in and we’ve always got targets,” said Neil.“This year we are a bit more advanced than we were this time last year and that’s good because I wanted to get a bit of business done immediately.“Now you go for ones who can probably be a wee bit more troublesome to get in but we are working hard on that and as the pre-season goes on maybe we’ll get a bit more business done.”To that end the gaffer has identified specific players and areas of the team where he wants to add more depth but will be giving nothing away on that until contracts have been signed.“I wouldn’t go into specific areas.

He’s dominant in the box, too, and comes for crosses.“At Vaduz there were two goalkeepers and they switched all the time but I really enjoyed playing when Benjamin was in goal.”Konrad is considering offers from Holland and Germany but says he’d be happy to return to Scotland.“I would go back to Scotland, I really enjoyed my two years there, though I’ve not had any options there. If there was a good offer I would go back.“A year ago at Vaduz we were relegated and weren’t able to go back up last campaign.“We had a poor start to the season with basically a new team. You could compare it to Dundee United’s season in the Championship. There was one team that had a good start and just kept winning.“It was nice in Vaduz, a good place to play. I can’t compare it to Scotland, though.“The fans in Dundee were mad for football and the stadiums were great. I don’t know if the fans in Vaduz and Switzerland don’t like football much but it isn’t the No 1 sport and it was really calm in the stadiums.”That’s something he couldn’t say about derby days in Dundee – some of his best memories of his time at Dens Park.“I had the two best years of my career at Dundee.“The derby win after 10 or 11 years and beating them at home was great.“The first game at Celtic Park was also a good memory. It is a really famous stadium, even in Germany.“All the derby wins were really good experiences and I feel really proud to have been a part of those games.“I like the rivalry in Dundee. It’s not a nasty rivalry compared with some places in Germany, there’s no fighting, but a lot of banter and people have a bit of a laugh about it.“I still keep an eye on Dundee. Unfortunately there are not many players left from when I was there.“Maybe Gowser, Cammy and Craig Wighton.

Xplore does not own any at the moment, but it is understood the firm will try to secure “green” funding in order to buy them.Last month, Transport Scotland announced a £1.7 million Scottish Green Bus Fund – the eighth such fund it has launched to promote the use of eco-friendly public transport. Xplore could take advantage of such an offer in order to buy new stock.Councillors were briefed on the plans by Xplore last week.City development convener Lynne Short said: “It’s really exciting.

ARGH\u0027s request the Autistic Pride Day flag was flown at the Scottish Government HQ, St Andrews House in Edinburgh,\" she said.Mrs Brook believes that it is a day of celebration and a chance for autistic people to show they are proud of who they are.She added: \"It\u0027s also a show of defiance to those who would rather we were ashamed, quiet, or forgotten.\"The group were supported by Tesco who provided craft materials, Ashers bakery who provided a celebration cake and Strathspey Railway who donated a family ticket for the quiz prize.Special speakers provided stories about life with

appointed champion.After months of stinging criticism over its treatment of people with autism NHS Highland has appointed occupational therapist Arlene Johnstone to be its first head of service for learning disabilities and autism.The health board faced a storm of criticism over its decision to withdraw a \u0026pound23,000 grant for the Highland One Stop Shop (HOSS) autism support service last year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s

Israeli medical technology firm Insightec has had the blessing of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) which advises British health authorities.Essential tremor (ET) and similar conditions impact people\u0027s ability to perform everyday tasks due to uncontrollable shaking.Sufferers treated at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London have experienced substantial improvement after access to the equipment, according to senior surgeons.The machine enables ultrasound waves to pass through the skull to the part of the brain responsible for the tremor.Due to the incision-less nature of focused ultrasound, there is no risk of infection and patients recover quickly.Mary Ramsay (61), a lifelong ET sufferer, has had to travel 450 miles to Newcastle \u0026ndash but for an alternative and invasive treatment. No other relevant technology was available anywhere in Scotland.Her case sparked a recent debate in the Scottish Parliament in support of her campaign for specialist equipment nearer home.She said: \"I\u0027m highly delighted.

Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland.

STV’s cameras will be there – and trying hard to keep up! – to capture the highs and lows of this incredible marathon venture\u0026#8217After a 4am start in Argyll, Mark’s 240-mile cycle route will pass through Tarbert, Ardrishaig, Lochgilphead, Inveraray, Tyndrum, Crainlarich, Killin, Aberfeldy, Pitlochry, Glenshee, Braemar, Ballater and Peterculter \u0026#8211 among many other towns and villages \u0026#8211 before finishing in Aberdeen.If you think you’re up for this epic feat of endurance, get in touch with Mark on aroundtheworld@thehunterfoundationA corporate offer is also available with four-person relay teams invited to enter for a minimum donation of £5,000.Can’t face the cycle but still want to be involved?

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"owner to assess sad inveraray halls condition","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 8:02 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe owners of the derelict Inveraray Inveraray Community Hall \u0026#8211 said to be in a \u0026#8216possibly dangerous\u0026#8217 condition \u0026#8211 are looking for financial help to assess its stability.Inspire Inveraray, formerly known as Inveraray Community Company, took over ownership of the hall in 2017 with ambitious plans for a new multi-purpose community centre on the site of the former school.The condition of the building, however, had deteriorated to such an extent in recent years that there were fears it would need to be demolished.

Road users will be sent on the usual lengthy diversion via the A819, A85 and the A82, though access will be maintained  for emergency vehicles.Following completion of the surfacing, further minor construction works to complete the project will take place ahead of the A83 opening to both lanes again later in July.Eddie Ross, of trunk road management company BEAR Scotland, said: \u0026#8216We thank motorists and the local community for their continued patience while teams work to complete the project.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12802034.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/swr_ayp_270318esther.jpg","title":"claims south ayrshire council poised","story":"NewsClaims that South Ayrshire Council poised to swoop on crumbling hotelCollapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley11:31, 27 JUN 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel (Image: ayrshire post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The council is poised to swoop on the Station Hotel to undertake emergency repairs it is claimed.  Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"holiday goer caused ruckus prestwick","story":"NewsHoliday-goer caused ruckus at Prestwick AirportIan Graham acted in an aggressive and intimidating manner towards Steven Ringtoul, and made threats of violence in the presence of children.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post16:00, 28 JUN 2018NewsAyr Sheriff Court (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA holidaygoer who caused a ruckus at Prestwick Airport has been fined.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"waiting-list-created-as-traders-flock-to-selkirk-market","story":"ORGANISERS of the new Selkirk Farmers\u0027 Market have revealed there is already a waiting list for stalls.\nThe inaugural event took place at the start of the month.\nAnd many of the 15 traders had sold out of stock within hours of opening.\nAll 15 stalls have already been booked for the second Market on Saturday, July 7.\nSelkirkshire councillor Caroline Penman said: \"The first Market was a huge success and the feedback from stallholders as well as shoppers was extremely positive.\n\"Many of the stallholders immediately booked for the next month and we now have a waiting list.\"\nLocal organisations receive a boost from the monthly Market with Selkirk Rugby Club\u0027s junior section receiving \u0026pound300 for assembling and taking down the stalls.\nAnd next month it will be the turn of the Selkirk Silver Band to receive the rental donation.\nA further \u0026pound75 was also given to Scott\u0027s Selkirk following the June Market.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"a-decade-of-singing-about-to-be-celebrated-in-peebles","story":"IT all began with an advertisement in the Peeblesshire News almost a decade ago.\nAndrew Russel, realising that contemporary choirs could be the next big thing, asked for anyone interested in singing as part of a community choir to pop into the Eastgate on September 2, 2008.\nHe expected around 30.\nWhat he got was around 130.\nEven after auditions had taken place, there were still over 100 members.\nAnd many of these founder members are still with this big choir today as it prepares for its 10th birthday celebrations.\nInChorus quickly became known -for their vibrant enthusiastic performances.\nThey were invited to sing at the public opening of the Scottish Parliament in May 2010.\nThe same year, they were asked by the American organisers of the September Concerts - a programme set up following the 9/11 atrocities to promote peace through music - to stage a concert on September 11, which took place at a packed Edinburgh Festival Theatre, and was streamed around the world.\nThis led to the choir travelling to New York to take part in the 10th anniversary commemorations of 9/11 in 2011.\nInChorus embarked on a huge fundraising programme for this and were blown away by the support they received from the community.\nOne fundraiser was a concert in the Usher Hall where they were joined by, among others, Mhairi Campbell and Dougie Maclean. InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"united-front-to-boost-the-borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716323237,16323170,16323072,16322769,16322601\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

You\u0026rsquore talking about the top 0.1%.\n\u0026ldquoIf you don\u0026rsquot get a clean sweep it\u0026rsquos not going to matter, there are still going to be plenty of options.\nMr Benton said one estimate, made last year, that just two pupils would get all grade 9s could have left pupils feeling discouraged, but the numbers are highly unlikely to be this low.\n\u0026ldquoGetting a grade 9 is a bit harder than an A*, but it is achievable, he said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos fine for students to have it as an ambition, but don\u0026rsquot get disheartened if you don\u0026rsquot get them across the board.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u0026ldquoThis research confirms that achieving straight Grade 9s is extremely difficult and will be a rare achievement.\n\u0026ldquoBut we need to avoid becoming too obsessed with Grade 9s as a barometer of excellence.\n\u0026ldquoWe are sure that this year\u0026rsquos results will show many young people doing very well across a range of grades and all deserve congratulations.\nAn Ofqual spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore aware that there is interest in the number of students who might, in the future, receive grade 9 results in all of their GCSE exams.\n\u0026ldquoNot\u0026nbspall GCSEs are graded 9 to 1 this summer, so students may\u0026nbspalso get some\u0026nbspA* to G grades too.\n\u0026ldquoWe have not done any modelling regarding the numbers likely to receive all grade 9s in those subjects which are graded numerically this year and make no prediction of figures like these in advance of a future awarding process.\n\u0026ldquoNeither did we previously make these kinds of calculations for the number of A* awards at GCSE.\nUnder major reforms, GCSEs have been toughened up, with less coursework and all exams taken at the end of the two-year course, rather than throughout.\nNew 9-1 grades have replaced the old-style A*-G system, with the first results \u0026ndash\u0026nbspin English and maths courses \u0026ndash awarded last summer.\nThis summer sees the first time new grades will be awarded in most other subjects.\nFewer candidates are expected to achieve a 9 in each subjects than the proportion who gained an A*, due to the deliberate move to change the system to allow more differentiation, particularly between the brightest candidates.\nWhereas before the highest grades were A and A* \u0026ndash this is now split across three \u0026ndash 7 to 9.\nShaun Fenton, HMC chairman elect and headmaster of Reigate Grammar School said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos important that we focus on students rather than statistics anyone who has worked hard and doesn\u0026rsquot get a 9 should celebrate and not be hard on themselves.\n\u0026ldquoThe most important thing about GCSEs is their educational value and preparation for A-level.\n\u0026ldquoHaving said that, those who do open their results this summer and see a Grade 9 should be particularly proud.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new

The atmosphere here is just amazing.\u0026#8217Away from the World Cup frenzy taking place across the country, Michael described life and work in Peru’s capital, the third-largest city in the Americas.He said: \u0026#8216Lima is a crazy, bustling city. A real metropolis. There are more than eight million people living here, a quarter of Peru\u0026#8217s population, so it is always hectic.‘Rush hour is madness.

It was as if they had won the World Cup.\u0026#8216Whole families were out on the streets enjoying the party atmosphere, grannies, parents with their young children, young people who can\u0026#8217t remember a World Cup with Peru in it.\u0026#8216That shows how proud they are to be there.’Despite the countries 1-0 defeat to Denmark in Saransk, Russia, \u0026#8211 in front of 40,000 travelling Peruvian fans, making them one of the best-supported nations at the tournament \u0026#8211 those back home were still kept in good spirits.Michael added: ‘No matter the result the massive street parties were going to continue.It was only 1pm local time and the football was finished, but there were marching bands, thousands of people chanting songs and TV cameras everywhere.‘Peru have at least two more matches to come (against France, at the time of writing, and Australia) and everyone will be back on the streets supporting the national team.‘Deep down the people know this might be a once-in-a-generation experience so they are determined to enjoy it as sport fans, and as proud Peruvians.’Michael Fee, farthest right, girlfriend Carla, second from right, and friends enjoy Peru’s World Cup party.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.

The debate during Health Question Time at Holyrood last Wednesday followed a recent public meeting which was organised by East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield and Lothian MSP Kezia Dugdale (both Labour) at the Fisherrow Centre, which attracted more than 200 people.  Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7996434.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"few-teenagers-likely-to-gain-clean-sweep-of-top-gcse-grades-study","story":"              As few as 200 teenagers could gain a clean sweep of top grades in this year\u0026rsquos GCSE exams, a study predicts.  New grades are due to be awarded for the first time this year in many GCSE courses \u0026ndash including key academic subjects such as science, history, geography and languages.  But few youngsters are likely to gain the highest result \u0026ndash a grade 9 \u0026ndash across all of their courses, according to research seen by the Press Association.  The paper published by Cambridge Assessment predicts that, among those taking at least eight GCSEs, between 200 and 900 will walk away with grade 9s in all subjects.  School leaders said the findings, which come just weeks before pupils learn their GCSE results, show achieving straight top grades under the new system is \u0026ldquoextremely difficult and will be a rare achievement.  The study used GCSE data from 2016 to predict the number of teenagers that are likely to achieve straight grade 9s in this summer\u0026rsquos exams.  The most conservative estimate, based on the numbers that scored all A* grades, suggests that around 200 candidates taking at least eight GCSEs will score 9s across the board.  The other two predictions take a more speculative approach, and take into account the varying abilities of those who scored A* grades \u0026ndash such as those scoring at the top end of the grade.  In these scenarios, the study concludes that up to 900 students could walk away with straight grade 9s.  In 2016, around 2,000 students gained A* in at least eight GCSEs, the author said.  More than half a million teenagers in England alone sit GCSEs \u0026ndash which are also taken in Wales and Northern Ireland \u0026ndash each year.  Study author Tom Benton said: \u0026ldquoStudents should not be despondent, you do not need a clean sweep of grade 9s, and almost nobody is going to do it. You\u0026rsquore talking about the top 0.1%.  \u0026ldquoIf you don\u0026rsquot get a clean sweep it\u0026rsquos not going to matter, there are still going to be plenty of options.  Mr Benton said one estimate, made last year, that just two pupils would get all grade 9s could have left pupils feeling discouraged, but the numbers are highly unlikely to be this low.  \u0026ldquoGetting a grade 9 is a bit harder than an A*, but it is achievable, he said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos fine for students to have it as an ambition, but don\u0026rsquot get disheartened if you don\u0026rsquot get them across the board.  Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u0026ldquoThis research confirms that achieving straight Grade 9s is extremely difficult and will be a rare achievement.  \u0026ldquoBut we need to avoid becoming too obsessed with Grade 9s as a barometer of excellence.  \u0026ldquoWe are sure that this year\u0026rsquos results will show many young people doing very well across a range of grades and all deserve congratulations.  An Ofqual spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore aware that there is interest in the number of students who might, in the future, receive grade 9 results in all of their GCSE exams.  \u0026ldquoNot\u0026nbspall GCSEs are graded 9 to 1 this summer, so students may\u0026nbspalso get some\u0026nbspA* to G grades too.  \u0026ldquoWe have not done any modelling regarding the numbers likely to receive all grade 9s in those subjects which are graded numerically this year and make no prediction of figures like these in advance of a future awarding process.  \u0026ldquoNeither did we previously make these kinds of calculations for the number of A* awards at GCSE.  Under major reforms, GCSEs have been toughened up, with less coursework and all exams taken at the end of the two-year course, rather than throughout.  New 9-1 grades have replaced the old-style A*-G system, with the first results \u0026ndash\u0026nbspin English and maths courses \u0026ndash awarded last summer.  This summer sees the first time new grades will be awarded in most other subjects.  Fewer candidates are expected to achieve a 9 in each subjects than the proportion who gained an A*, due to the deliberate move to change the system to allow more differentiation, particularly between the brightest candidates.  Whereas before the highest grades were A and A* \u0026ndash this is now split across three \u0026ndash 7 to 9.

Earlier this month the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) handed a \u0026pound10 million fine to PwC for its 2014 audit of BHS, which was sold by the tycoon\u0026rsquos Taveta Group for \u0026pound1 ahead of its demise in 2016.  The\u0026nbspFRC also sanctioned Steve Denison, the audit partner responsible, fined him \u0026pound500,000 and banned him from performing audit work for 15 years.  The body has not yet published its findings but is now free to do so after Mr Justice Nicklin refused to grant the injunction, which was sought by Sir Philip\u0026rsquos holding company Taveta Investments.  The judge said Taveta had not demonstrated this was an \u0026ldquoexceptional case which required an injunction.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe injunction is sought to restrain the publication of statements alleged to defame Taveta personnel pending Taveta\u0026rsquos judicial review claim.  \u0026ldquoAlthough I have found that the threatened publication does make criticisms of the Taveta personnel that are capable of being defamatory of them (and seriously so), such a threatened publication is not exceptional.  The judge said those who Taveta argued would be \u0026ldquoadversely affected by the report\u0026rsquos publication did not include Sir Philip.  Lawyers for Taveta had argued at a hearing last week that, if the injunction was not granted, a judicial review of the FRC\u0026rsquos report sought by Taveta would be \u0026ldquopointless as the \u0026ldquodamage would be done.  BHS collapsed in the summer of 2016 with a sizeable pension deficit and the loss of 11,000 jobs, triggering a parliamentary inquiry spearheaded by Labour MP Frank Field.  MPs ultimately called for Sir Philip\u0026rsquos knighthood to be rescinded.  Mr Field, who branded Sir Philip the \u0026ldquounacceptable face of capitalism had been pressing the FRC to publish its findings on the discredited audit and wanted to know what changes have been requested by Taveta.  The MP, who is chair of the work and pensions committee, said: \u0026ldquoMr Justice Nicklin needed much wisdom to make this judgment.  \u0026ldquoThe High Court has put aside the special pleading of a plaintiff whose financial resources are almost unlimited.  \u0026ldquoIn doing so, it has struck a judgment that such individuals have a very high test to meet if they are to succeed in gagging a regulator, whose report is of interest to so many citizens.  \u0026ldquoWe will be writing to the Insolvency Service to ask them to reopen their investigation into BHS\u0026rsquo former directors in light of the FRC\u0026rsquos findings."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7767466.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"castlemilk-singing-sensation-gerry-cinnamon-announces-four-glasgow-gig-dates","story":"              CASTLEMILK singing sensation Gerry Cinnamon has announced four Glasgow gig dates.

I do understand it is difficult to come to an agreement within her Cabinet and the UK Parliament, but she has to.\"  As he arrived at the European Council in Brussels, Mr Rutte added that it was \"crucial\" to resolve the Irish border issue.

New figures show the average salary of Scottish graduates was \u0026pound23,500 in 2016/17 - \u0026pound500 more than students leaving university in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  The highest salaries of \u0026pound33,500 were earned by graduates from medicine and dentistry, followed by the \u0026pound30,000 for those who studied social studies, engineering or mathematical science.

New UK-wide research from consumer organisation Which? has revealed that while there are concerns over the rate of bank branch closures across the country, Scotland\u0027s rural communities are being worst hit by ATM closures.  Which? said their report casts doubt pledges made by Link, the UK\u0027s largest cash machine network, to protect access to cash in rural areas.  But Which? said that its research based on Link data shows that there was a net loss of 146 cashpoints in Scotland between November, last year and the end of March this year - 2.2 per cent of the network. There are now 6,367 machines in the Scottish network with around 5,400 free to use.  The Which? research appears to contradict a statement made by Link chairman Sir Mark Boleat to MSPs two weeks ago that the current figure for open ATMs in Scotland \"is probably the highest it has ever been\" and that \"there has been no reduction in number\". While the UK lost two per cent of its Link machines, Scotland\u0027s rural network was hardest hit with 49 shut - a 2.9 per cent net loss.  It comes two weeks after separate research revealed that bank branches have closed at a rate of two a week in Scotland over the last four years.  According to Which?, Scotland was the worst hit area in the UK for bank branches shut or scheduled to close between 2015 and 2018.    The study comes after it was revealed that Scotland faces being one of the worst affected areas of the UK as plans to cut fees for card machine operators are set to sound the death knell on thousands of \u0026lsquohole-in-the-wall\u0026rsquo machines.  July 1 marks the start of a phased cut in the fee Link receives from banks per transaction from 25p to 20p.  Link has said that up to ten per cent of the 5,400 free-to-use ATMs in Scotland could be lost as a result.  Link had previously guaranteed that ATMs which were more than 1km from the nearest alternative cash-point would not be subject to the controversial cut.  Which? say closures have accelerated as operators began to learn of the fee-cutting plans.  A Which? spokesman said: \"The findings suggest that ATM operators have already decided measures designed to protect access to cash in more remote areas are insufficient and seem to run contrary to Link\u0027s promises that it will do \u0026ldquowhatever it takes to maintain ATM provision.  \"While digital payments are increasing, we are concerned that not enough is being done to preserve consumers\u0026rsquo access to cash payments, which are still relied upon by 2.7 million people across the UK.  \"UK Finance recently found that cash accounted for just over a third of all payments in 2017, showing it is still vital to millions of people.  \"Which? is concerned that Link\u0026rsquos decision was simply waved through by the regulator without considering the impact on consumers.  \"With fresh evidence of the negative impact these funding changes are having on the network, Which? is calling on the regulator to halt Link\u0026rsquos cuts, before more communities lose their ATMs.\"  Which? said that across the UK cash machines are closing at a rate of 300 every month.    Some 1,500 machines closed between November, last year and the end of March this year marking a near six-fold increase from a steady rate of fewer than 50 closures a month since 2015.  One of the largest independent ATM providers, NoteMachine, said learning of the changes in late 2017 had \u0026ldquoan immediate effect on its ability to maintain widespread free access, while the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA) said the move set the network on \u0026ldquoa path to disaster.  Harry Rose of Which? said: \u0026ldquoWith hundreds of cashpoints closing every month we have serious concerns that, far from protecting consumers\u0026rsquo access to cash, LINK\u0026rsquos plans risk destroying it.  \u0026ldquoThese cuts could see millions of people who rely on cash in their daily lives struggling through these closures - with severe consequences for many Scottish communities and businesses.\"  Ged Killen, the Labour MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West who is introducing bill at Westminster to protect the free-to-use network said the findings were \"deeply concerning\".    He said: \"Rural Scotland has suffered the worst of these reductions and there are now real fears we could see cash machine deserts created across the country.  \u0026ldquoLINK has so far failed to meet its promises and it is time for the regulator (the PSR) to seriously look at stepping in.  Link insists that the number of free-to-use ATMs has increased across the UK and questioned the methodology.

She suggested this was a \u0026ldquoperfect illustration of Global Britain, clinching a lucrative deal as the country embarked on life beyond the European Union.  BAE Systems has been chosen as the preferred bidder for the SEA 5000 Future Frigate, beating off competition from Italy and Spain.  The UK company will build nine warships in Adelaide with a design based on Britain\u0026rsquos Type 26 Global Combat Ship the first export of a British design for new-build frigates since the 1970s.  No 10 explained the agreement would secure more than 4000 jobs in Australia and also boost Britain\u0026rsquos export economy for generations to come.  In turn, it said it was hoped that the contract would also benefit the UK economy with exports having the potential to drive regional growth, create new jobs and showcase the strength of British innovation on the world stage.  The multi-billion pound deal is the result of four years of intensive Government engagement involving a number of departments across Whitehall.  The Prime Minister has been directly involved in making the case for the UK bid, including in bilateral talks with her Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull at Chequers earlier this year.  Over the past 18 months Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, and Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, have all visited Australia to extol the benefits of Britain\u0026rsquos world-class design, engineering and innovation.  \u0026ldquoThe sheer scale and nature of this contract puts the UK at the very forefront of maritime design and engineering and demonstrates what can be achieved by UK industry and Government working hand-in-hand, declared Mrs May.  \u0026ldquoWe have always been clear that as we leave the EU we have an opportunity to build on our close relationships with allies like Australia. This deal is a perfect illustration that the Government is doing exactly that.  \u0026ldquoAnd while this is an enormous boost for the UK economy, it will also cement our strategic partnership with one of our oldest and closest friends for decades to come, she added.  Dr Fox pointed out how the UK and Australia already enjoyed a strong trading relationship worth more than \u0026pound13 billion a year.  \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos announcement is a further boost to this relationship, which will create significant opportunities for companies in both countries to deepen their trading ties.  These opportunities, the International Trade Secretary explained, included increased data and information sharing, high-end technology transfer, and collaboration at the cutting-edge of maritime expertise.  Downing Street also pointed out how the new contract would build on the century-long ties between the two nations and would allow \u0026ldquointeroperability between Australian and Royal Navy ships amid a climate of intensifying threats around the world, especially in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific regions.  The 6,900 tonne multi-mission warships are designed to support anti-submarine warfare and a whole range of other operations anywhere in the world. They will form a key part of Australia\u0026rsquos hugely respected Navy.  The contract was secured with the UK committed to getting eight of the Type 26 warfare frigates, which are currently in-build on the River Clyde and are set to enter service with the Royal Navy in the 2020s.  Charles Woodburn for BAE Systems added: \u0026ldquoI am proud that our world class anti-submarine warfare design and our approach to transferring technology and skills to the nations in which we work is expected to contribute to the development of an enduring world-class naval shipbuilding industry in Australia."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7992962.jpg?type=article-full","title":"jan-patience-the-end-may-be-nigh-for-glasgow-school-of-arts-mackintosh-building","story":"              If buildings could talk, The Mack could tell you some stories. But this latest chapter in its chequered history takes some beating.  For over a century this majestic building which sits on a hill off Sauchiehall Street has been the beating heart of Glasgow\u0027s cultural life. It\u0027s no exaggeration to say that Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0027s Art Nouveau masterwork has fostered some of the brightest and most creative talents Scotland has ever produced.  It survived two world wars and one almost catastrophic fire four years ago. Now, with the news that large sections of The Mack will be \"dismantled\" within days following a second inferno two weeks ago, it looks like the end is nigh for The Mack.  No-one could have predicted the turn of events which led to the almost-renovated building being burned to a crisp. It was late on a Friday night \u0026ndash graduation day as it happened for Glasgow School of Art\u0027s latest cohort of students \u0026ndash when the fire was first noticed by a passing policeman. Within an hour, it had spread like wildfire. The flames licked over to the adjacent O2 ABC venue and soon its roof caved had in like a sunken blancmange.  Today, all around The Mack\u0027s majestic teetering walls, there is both physical and mental turmoil. Since that fateful night, people have been unable to return to their homes in the area around Garnethill and Sauchiehall Street. Businesses in the immediate vicinity have been locked out, with business owners and staff facing penury. Crowdfunding campaigns have even been started by small non-funded creative business based in the nearby CCA on Sauchiehall Street looking for financial help to pay staff.  Yesterday, First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, revealed during First Minister\u0027s Questions at Holyrood that a hardship fund to help people forced from their homes thanks to a safety cordon around the building will give \u0026pound1,500 to residents affected which will be matched by Glasgow City Council.  In the immediate aftermath of the fire the painter, Alison Watt, who graduated from GSA in the late 1980s and whose artist father James also graduated from the art school in the 1950s, talked on national radio about her intense feelings of loss on hearing that The Mack had been engulfed by flames yet again.  Turner Prize winning artist and GSA alumni, Douglas Gordon, flew back to Scotland from his home in Paris to see \"the corpse of the Mackintosh\". He speaks for many former students and staff when he added, \"part of my life has been cut out.\"  It all feels so distant from the cold February day last year when Gordon led me on a tour of the empty Mack for a feature in The Herald magazine. \"It [The Mack] was a place of real freedom,\" he told me. \"I haven\u0027t lived in Glasgow for nearly 30 years but it all feels really immediate. I feel both nostalgic and melancholic all at the same time.\"  While we were there, Gordon picked up a couple of pieces of green plaster from the floor which had fallen off one of the studio walls. \"Here, take this,\" he whispered conspiratorially. I still have these shards of green plaster from The Mack. They are sitting winking at me as I write.  In the two weeks since the Mack fire, mark two, I have watched as people\u0027s feelings turned from shock to anger. I have read accusations of mismanagement on the art school\u0027s part and rumours that there was inadequate insurance in place.  A statement put out by the Glasgow School of Art the day after put it so baldly, the Mackintosh Building had been undergoing a period or extensive restoration following the fire in 2014 \u0027and therefore has not been a part of the GSA\u0027s operational campus for four years.\"  The blame game started immediately in the media and on social media. All over my virtual world \u0026ndash admittedly filled with people linked to the creative community in Scotland \u0026ndash there has been much wailing and gnashing of teeth. People are livid and looking for someone to blame.  Where was the sprinkler system in the renovated building, people asked? That same question was asked four years ago and the same people feel they didn\u0027t get answers.  Leading GSA-trained architect, Alan Dunlop, prompted anger when he suggested that The Mack should be demolished and an international competition be launched to create a new building with the same spirit. Mackintosh was an innovator, he said, and he would not have wanted a facsimile\u0026hellip  Since Mackintosh isn\u0027t around to give his view, we will never know.    Friday\u0027s cartoon by Steven Camley  Labour MP Paul Sweeney, who is director of the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust, was one of the first public figures to be allowed behind the cordon around The Mack after the fire. His observations that the walls were still solid led to some optimism in among the initial gloom. Last night, he said he was \u0026ldquoopen minded about holding a public inquiry, but insisted there first needed to be more clarity about how the fire started.  So what was it that was so special about The Mack? In my eyes, it was like the most charismatic lover you\u0027d ever been with \u0026ndash or never been with. I\u0027d have given anything to have been one of the thousands of students who passed through these magical swing doors in Mackintosh\u0027s famous elongated art nouveau script with the words ART (on the in door) and SCHOOL (on the out door).  I visited it as a sixteen-year-old and fell in love on the spot with the place. How could I not, with these doors and that library? When I went home to Ayrshire and told my normally mild-mannered dad I wanted to apply to get go to this magical place, he swiftly put the kibosh on the idea. \"But how would you get a job as an artist,\" he spluttered?  As it turned out, getting a job as anything in the 1980s was going to be hard but if my subsequent degree in English and Scottish Literature had any use, it led me (eventually) into writing about art. And that meant I got to visit The Mack as an almost-insider.  As one alumni and former member of GSA\u0027s management staff wrote to me in the wee sma\u0027 hours of June 16: \"We all smoked in the building and had done so for decades. Stamping cigarettes out on timber floors surrounded by white spirit. Rennie, the librarian, was a chronic chain smoker in his wee office in the library. Maybe this is too much information, but I\u0027m probably one of many who made love in the building. This latest news is death.\"  The fixtures and fittings rescued from the last fire at GSA remain off-site. Its beautiful library had been rebuilt and is sitting in a warehouse in Edinburgh. Like a confused child piece waiting for a home.  I sent the painter Alison Watt a message last night asking her what one thing she\u0027d like to tell The Mack.  Almost instantly, she wrote back: \"You continue to live inside all of us who love you.\""},{"url":null,"title":"calls-to-locate-new-glasgow-school-of-art-building-in-citys-east-end","story":"              Local councillors have made a unusual suggestion about the future of the Mackintosh building.  As the next steps for the Glasgow School of Art\u0027s famous building remain uncertain, Glasgow politicians have suggested recreating the structure in the city\u0027s East End.  Martin McElroy and Maureen Burke both claim the Charles Rennie Mackintosh designed building could be a boon to areas of regeneration.  One wants to see the building moved to Dennistoun while the other suggests Easterhouse would be a welcoming home.  Mr McElroy, the Labour party\u0027s representative in Springburn/Robroyston ward, said: \u0026ldquoLike all Glaswegians I was saddened to see the damage that this fire has caused to one of the most beautiful buildings in the city.  \u0026ldquoIf it cannot be saved and needs to be rebuilt we should look at locating the new Glasgow School of Art in a part of the city that requires regeneration.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of gap sites in the north and east of the city that would be suitable and could provide a huge boost to an area that needs it.\"  The politician believes cash to take down and rebuild the building - known as the Mack - could come from the sale of the land it currently sits on.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe land in Garnethill is potentially very valuable and could offset some of the costs associated with a rebuild as well.  \u0026ldquoBecause of the world famous nature of our School of Art we could potentially be talking about regenerating an entire neighbourhood.  \u0026ldquoAs a proud son of Glasgow, I am certain that this is something that Charles Rennie Mackintosh would be happy to have as the next phase of his legacy.  Building control experts have inspected the building in the wake of the fire to determine whether it could be saved.  Initial possibilities included another restoration project, estimated at around \u0026pound100 million or taking the remaining structure down and rebuilding it brick by brick on the current site, which could cost as much as \u0026pound200 million, according to construction experts.  Nicola Sturgeon said after visiting the site that the Scottish Government was ready to do \u0026ldquoanything we reasonably can to ensure the Mackintosh Building has a future.  Maureen Burke, Labour councillor for the North East ward, suggested Easterhouse as a potential new home for the Mack.  The area has undergone extensive regeneration, including the building of arts centre The Bridge.  Ms Burke said: \u0026ldquoAs every politician and member of the public would say, it is really sad what has happened.  \u0026ldquoIf they can save the building, that is great.  \u0026ldquoIf it is the case they need to look at rebuilding it, as a councillor for the north and east end of the city, we should be looking at other options and this could be one.  \u0026ldquoThere is a lot of regeneration happening on this side of the city.  \u0026ldquoIf you look at The Bridge, no one thought that would work but now it is thriving.  \u0026ldquoEasterhouse has various plots of vacant land available and we should be looking at that as an option."},{"url":null,"title":"stereophonics-to-kick-off-trnsmt-festival","story":"              Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest music festival will kick off on Friday with performances by the Stereophonics and James Bay.

The Mack\u0027s interior was bathed in light, boasting huge plains of space, artists often remarked.  It had almost ideal studios for drawing and painting, and other, smaller spaces for private contemplation and study.  And a basement lecture theatre with its uncomfortable timber benches, where everything and everyone, felt close and intimate.  And, after degree shows - which often felt rather cramped and chaotic in the studio spaces - it was also a venue, perhaps, for some after-hours celebrations.  Even then, if you were toting a glass of white wine past the red-stickered artworks of young artists on their way to the world outside its walls, it was easy to feel that year\u0026rsquos graduating class was part of a continuum of art making \u0026ndash in sculpture, paint, pencil, watercolour and oils \u0026ndash stretching back to Mackintosh himself.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot that he just designed the building, there was more: it was the light fixtures, some of the furniture, the library, the clocks, the windows, Mr Gray said.  It was at the heart of generations of artists\u0027 lives, intimately so. Many speak of it like an old friend, or much-loved relative, or nurturing home, and its loss a personal bereavement.  Now fire has extinguished the light and the space for art is only ruin.  For Gray, the Mackintosh Building, where he studied painting, was an historical monument, too, to a singular talent.  Yesterday he quoted the film maker and writer Timothy Neat, who once said Mackintosh showed in his most famous building that he had enough talent, he could have \u0026ldquodesigned a civilisation.  Mr Gray added: \u0026ldquoThere were three great architects at the beginning of the 19th century: Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago, [Antoni] Gaudi in Barcelona, Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow.  \u0026ldquoThey were the figures, doing new and exciting work, finding a new style to counter the Victorians, even though Glasgow did not get the support he needed in Glasgow, and was even black-balled from arts clubs.  \u0026ldquoBut all there is left of his work now is the Hill House in Helensburgh, Scotland Street School \u0026ndash which is not even a school anymore but a museum which shows you what a school looks like \u0026ndash and of course the church in Maryhill. This fire, it is rotten for Glasgow.  This week Professor Ray McKenzie, an honorary professor at Glasgow School of Art, told Artforum that in the building, Mackintosh had kept the balance of \u0026ldquobeauty, durability and fitness for purpose in perfect equilibrium. He added: \u0026ldquoAfter 34 years teaching in the Mack I never once tired of its life-enhancing generosity as a design, its continual reaffirmation of the \u0026lsquopoetics of architecture.  Martin Boyce, the Turner Prize winning artist and alumni of the school, spoke this week to Frieze online that the building was magical.  He added: \u0026ldquoTo enter through those swing doors marked \u0026lsquoIn\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoOut\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoArt\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoSchool\u0026rsquo was to enter a place of art.  \u0026ldquoWith the exception of a small office halfway up the main stairwell, I never had any sense of administration. It seemed to be all bright studios and dark stairwells, a jewel-like library and the \u0026lsquoHen Run\u0026rsquo corridor.  Karla Black, another notable alumni and Turner Prize nominee, said that she can walk through the whole building in her head, \u0026ldquoalong the Hen Run, see the graffiti on the hard, uncomfortable benches in the Mackintosh Lecture Theatre, walk up the stairs to the museum.  She noted: \u0026ldquoI loved it. I would sit in the old library, reading and staring at it, thinking \u0026lsquoI can\u0026rsquot believe I\u0026rsquom allowed to be in here\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoMy memories of the building are visceral and physical: my hand flat on the brass plate of the big, black, wooden swing doors, marked \u0026lsquoIn\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoOut\u0026rsquo in Art Nouveau font.

The SNP Government yesterday announced it was giving the money to Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited (FMEL), despite questions over its financial disclosures.  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said the money would provide \u0026ldquoworking capital for the Clyde shipbuilder alongside private investment intended to help diversify the business.  The Port Glasgow yard was acquired by billionaire Jim McColl, a member of the First Minister\u0026rsquos Council of Economic Advisers, after it went into administration in 2014.  However it has been flagged on the Companies House website for not yet filing its annual accounts for 2016, which were due by September 2017.  The most recent public accounts are for the year ending December 2015.  Its immediate parent company, Ferguson Marine Engineering (Holdings) Ltd, is also nine months overdue filing its annual accounts, according to the Companies House website.  Ferguson Marine last night said it had an approval for late filing, but did not explain why it needed it - extensions are normally granted for events outwith a company\u0026rsquos control.  There is no public record of a late filing approval on the Companies House website. Both firms are ultimately owned by Mr McColl\u0026rsquos Clyde Blowers empire.  Green MSP John Finnie said: \u0026ldquoTransparency is vital when public funds are concerned, and this substantial loan must be held up to scrutiny.  \u0026ldquoShip servicing and repair, low carbon marine projects and decommissioning work are all very worthy but it\u0026rsquos clearly a concern if public funds are being used to support a company with a chequered history.  Mr Mackay said one of Mr McColl\u0026rsquos investment vehicles, Clyde Blowers Capital, would also invest alongside the loan to diversify the yard\u0026rsquos work.  Mr McColl recently spoke of expanding into green energy.  The year after Mr McColl acquired Ferguson\u0026rsquos it won a \u0026pound97m contract to build two new \u0026lsquodual fuel\u0026rsquo ferries for government-owned CalMac, securing work for the 150 staff.  However the contract has not gone smoothly, with the first vessel delayed from May this year to the winter, despite Mr McColl assuring ministers in early 2017 that it would be on time.

Retail chain Halfords and the Bikeability Trust, the national charity for cycling training, have launched a partnership to help 25,000 more children of primary school age in England access safe cycling programmes.  The initiative follows a survey commissioned by Halfords, which shows that 56% of parents want cycling safety added to the national curriculum so that all children will be taught to cycle competently, and proficiently on the roads.  The research also found that a third of parents think there should be a special cycling highway code for children, and one in eight families with under 12s have at least one member who does not know how to ride a bike.  Halfords will provide free bike safety checks for every child taking part in a Bikeability programme, as well as for their parents, teachers and trainers.  Chief executive Graham Stapleton said: \u0026ldquoBy helping more children cycle more safely and more often, families will be inspired to get out on their bikes.  Cycling Minister Jesse Norman said: \u0026ldquoThe benefits of cycling and walking are enormous. For people, it means cheaper travel and better health. For businesses, it means increased productivity and increased footfall in shops, and for society as a whole it means lower congestion, better air quality, and vibrant, attractive places.  \u0026ldquoHalfords\u0026rsquo investment in cycle training for children is a great boost for the delivery of the Bikeability programme.  \u0026ldquoThis investment in the future generation of cyclists, will allow us to reach and train more children than ever before."},{"url":null,"title":"plea-for-images-of-mackintosh-blaze-to-help-investigators","story":"              An appeal has been launched for images of the blaze which ripped through Glasgow School of Art\u0026rsquos Mackintosh building.

Whilst travelling\u0026nbspthrough India he came across an old British school satchel\u0026nbspand taken by the design, he decided to get a few made by local artisans. He sold these satchels from the attic in his home, as well as a few vintage furniture pieces from India. These satchels and vintage furniture proved to be quiet popular as they were items people couldn\u0027t get anywhere else.  Things started to grow.\u0026nbspToday,\u0026nbspScaramanga is made up of a team of 10 and has become a globally recognized brand that sells online as well as out of their shop in Cupar.

Men and women of all ages can find a style\u0026nbspthat suits them whether it\u0027s for work, adventure or travel.

The team are proud to get reviews such as \u0027I\u0027ve had my bag for 7 years now and it still keeps better and better with age!\u0027.

Since then customer numbers have soared, with up to 200 hour-long sessions now running each week.                                                    Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing. Providing a 100% natural and drug free complimentary treatment, halotherapy, derived from the Greek alas, meaning \"salt\", is believed to loosen mucus and reduce inflammation making breathing easier.        Donna said: \u0026ldquoWe were increasingly aware of the vulnerability of the oil and gas industry, and although we both had good jobs, our working days were getting longer and more stressful which began to impact on our family life, so the timing seemed to lend itself to a total lifestyle change.\"My mum and grandmother are regulars at Salt Caves in Inverness and Edinburgh, and both had seen a significant reduction in their respective symptoms and an upturn in their general wellbeing.

Our adviser undertook a property search on our behalf and provided invaluable information on commercial leasing and the documentation we needed to provide to secure it.

Sue Ryder launched an appeal in June 2017 to double the size of its local neurological care centre, which cares for people living with long-term neurological conditions including Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis and acquired brain injuries.                                                    The expansion project was introduced in response to the growing demand for neurological care in the North East of Scotland. Sue Ryder Dee View Court is currently home to 24 people living with complex and long-term conditions, with a waiting list double this amount.        The appeal has already reached £2.2million, with the charity now encouraging community fundraisers to set their targets in £1,000 segments, or ‘bricks’ as part of the Brick by Brick campaign - each £1,000 raised equates to one brick in the new centre. Emma Leiper Finlayson, Capital Appeal Manager for Sue Ryder Dee View Court said: “There’s a desperate need for unified neurological care in Scotland and our waiting list increases all the time.  We urgently need to expand, and our Dee View appeal is the first step in Sue Ryder’s strategy to care for more people who need help to live well and thrive across Scotland.“Since launching the appeal, we have been overwhelmed and delighted with the response from the community. In particular, the Brick by Brick initiative, which has been a fantastic platform to engage local companies and schools in some fun and creative fundraising. By buying a brick for the extension they are quite literally helping us build brighter futures for people in their community.“Of course, our residents have been involved in the appeal too, with one recently taking part in the Aberdeen Kiltwalk with her family, whilst other residents have encouraged their friends and family to undertake challenges, such as the Great Aberdeen Run.

It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Friday 29 Jun 2018 3:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

You might even be able to buy your own one!The pupils had been working on the concept of improving cycling safety since January and came up with the idea of covering a bike in Led lights.The bike was coded using a BBC micro:bit and buttons were wired up to have functions such as working indicators, brake lights \u0026ndash which turn the whole bike red \u0026ndash and a speedometer, as well as customisable colours.Pupils taking part in Apps for Good explore all aspects of product development, from the initial idea and programming to product design and marketing.Mr Aitken says he hopes to build on the success of the Light Bike by setting up an Inventors\u0026rsquo Club in Wick High and possibly a CoderDojo \u0026ndash part of a network of computer programming clubs \u0026ndash for primary children.This week\u0026rsquos category win was the latest in a series of Apps for Good achievements by teams from Wick High.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been incredibly lucky to have seen success now at the Apps for Good Awards for six years running \u0026ndash an unbeaten record, Mr Aitken said.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove seen our ideas evolve from the creation of wireframe prototypes to full-blown apps and we\u0026rsquore now pushing the boundaries further with the introduction of Internet of Things, physical computing, and very soon we\u0026rsquoll be starting machine learning / artificial intelligence with our pupils.\u0026ldquoAs always, I\u0026rsquom excited for what the future may bring for Wick High School pupils.Friday 29 Jun 2018 3:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June 29, 2018 at 1:30 pmPentland Ferries has said today that it is frustrated by the delay in implementing the Scottish Government’s subsidy scheme.

The crew also carried out maintenance work on lights and lanterns.As time went by the vessel was employed in the conversion of automated lighthouses to solar panel operation. When this work was completed in 1996, the ship was taken out of service.An initiative was later launched to preserve the vessel as a floating cultural monument.This ship is representative of a type of specialised vessel from a unique period in the history of Norwegian lighthouses and is open to the public today, Wednesday, afternoon 2pm-6pm, the again from 10am-Noon and 2pm \u0026#8211 6pm on Thursday.More details about the visit of the ship in The Orcadian next week.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Friday 29 Jun 2018 3:44 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However as soon as he was able, he was back in the saddle.The supermarket worker was delighted with his recent racing success followed by his selection for the GB squad for the world championships at the end of July and beginning of August.\"I really wanted to retain the national title but this year I knew I had my work cut out as I was up against my friend and main competitor Ben Watson who is a full time GB rider,\" he said.\"It was a great race. I felt good going into it and was able to counter any attacks and came down to a sprint where I was able to take the win.\"The news got better when British Cycling announced the world championship squad for this year with my name on it. I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to pulling on the GB kit for the first time.\"The hard work is paying off and I am hoping this is a stepping stone towards becoming a full-time GB rider. I\u0026rsquom really happy at being given this opportunity, being only 18 years old.\"He said the last eight months had only been possible thanks to the generosity of Moray Estates in paying for all his training and racing travel costs.He also thanked Tesco Dingwall which had been flexible with his shifts, allowing him to travel to races.Last year\u0026rsquos Strathpuffer 24-hour endurance event raised \u0026pound1000 to be divided between Fin and the charity Lupus UK.Friday 29 Jun 2018 3:44 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Most damaging of all, Loganair noted, was the announcement by Flybe that it was entering a new franchise agreement with Eastern Airways and would compete head-to-head on six routes.            Despite the turbulence, Loganair booked record turnover of £110.7m, a rise of 7 per cent. Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4761651.1530260357!/image/image.jpg","title":"limmy gets reaction from gary lineker for england world cup tweet","story":"\t\tLimmy provoked an incredulous reaction on Twitter from England football legend and BBC presenter Gary Lineker.\t\t\t\t• READ MORE: Watch as Sky News reads out Limmy’s ‘tribute’ to Peter Stringfellowwindow.twttr = (function(d, s, id) {            The mild-mannered Linker told the Glasgow comedian and prankster that he was speaking “utter tosh” after the Limmy, real name Brian Limond, had tweeted the Match of the Day host that England were “throwing” their World Cup fixture with Belgium on Thursday night.            England and Belgium were in a unique position going into the final Group G encounter in that the team who finished top of the group had, on paper, a more difficult route to the final of the tournament currently being played in Russia.Both teams made numerous changes to their strongest line-up with the Belgians winning 1-0 thanks to a goal from former Manchester United starlet Adnan Januzaj. It meant England avoided a potential clash with Brazil in the quarter-final, setting up a last-16 match with Colombia.Limmy, who hit the news when a tribute tweet of Peter Stringfellow was read out on Sky News, started a Twitter thread criticising England’s approach to the game. He asked Twitter: “I’m hearing that England are deliberately playing s***e in order to not be up against Brazil or something, is that true?”It was followed by calling England “cowards” and saying that he wouldn’t let the Scotland national team back in the country if they did the same at a World Cup, while using hashtags #freedom and #indyref2”            He tweeted: “So there you have it.

Shameful.”Limmy then included Gary Lineker in a tweet and the 57-year-old, who scored 10 World Cup goals for England, replied asking what Limmy was talking about, much to the amusement of Limmy’s fans.            Linker failed to see the joke in Limmy’s reply which said “England are throwing this game in order to avoid going up against Brazil. If Scotland had a team like England, we’d give it everything, all the way. #freedom #indyref2”.He branded Limmy’s view “absolute rubbish. They didn’t throw the game.

In the relatively brief history of devolution, one has to go back to Jack McConnell’s reshuffle of November 2001 to find one of comparable ferocity. Then, five senior and two junior ministers went in a reshuffle that earned the then Labour first minister the nickname “Jack the Knife”. Mr (now Lord) McConnell wielded the axe within hours of taking the top job. In contrast, it has taken Ms Sturgeon months, if not years, to carry out a similar exercise.            Yesterday’s reshuffle was long overdue. For many months now a somewhat tired-looking ministerial team had seemed to struggle to get a grip on domestic issues. In some ways that feeling of drift was typified yesterday with the Scottish Government having to deal with news on cancer waiting times and Education Secretary John Swinney shelving key education legislation.As Ms Sturgeon’s right hand man, Mr Swinney was always going to be safe from yesterday’s blood-letting. The same was not true of her good friend, Health Secretary Shona Robison. Ms Robison has been a lame duck struggling to swim against a tide of poor NHS performance indicators. As was clear from her resignation letter, Ms Robison has also had some very difficult personal issues to contend with. In those circumstances, it is perhaps easy to understand why she would want some time away from the pressure cooker environment of Cabinet politics. Ms Sturgeon will be sad to see the departure of one of her oldest friends in politics. But the truth is a fresh face is desperately needed at what is always one of the trickiest portfolios for a government.• READ MORE: Scottish Government Cabinet Reshuffle: Who’s in and Who’s out?            All sorts of spin can be spun about Keith Brown moving into an enhanced depute role with the SNP, but the reality is that Scotland’s economic growth is still lagging behind the rest of the UK. Mr Brown is a casualty of the decision to put his brief under Finance Secretary Derek Mackay’s umbrella – a change that seems entirely sensible. Angela Constance’s departure is perhaps not unexpected with her post going to former public health minister Aileen Campbell. Of the promotions, Humza Yousaf faces a tough job as Justice Secretary. That is clear given the challenges that Michael Matheson has faced, having to get to grips with the dysfunctional nature of Police Scotland. Mr Yousaf has shown himself to be a politician of determination in his handling of the notoriously tricky transport brief – which now goes to Mr Matheson, who remains in the Cabinet. Jeane Freeman, who in a previous life was a Labour adviser, has long been seen as a politician destined for the Cabinet. She has the unenviable task of taking over the health brief that always proves so difficult no matter who is in charge.             So far Ms Freeman has proved herself relatively sure-footed, aside from an episode last year when she was accused of making a clumsy attempt at smearing a nurse in a TV debate.The return of Michael Russell is an indication of Brexit looming on the horizon, while Shirley Anne Somerville faces the intimidating task of setting up Scotland’s social security system."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4761886.1530279762!/image/image.jpg","title":"queensferry crossing works to cause traffic misery over summer","story":"\t\tSnagging work on the trouble hit Queensferry Crossing will continue all through summer, transports chiefs revealed yesterday.\t\t\t\tIt will spell frustration for motorists forced to endure tailbacks getting on and off the new bridge.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"hotel chain sets its sights on up and coming destination lerwick ","story":"\nTravelodge has written to the SIC to ask about potential development sites.\nShetland is one of 20 areas identified by the firm, as the chain looks to expand across Scotland.\nAccording to Travelodge, they have written to the SIC to propose a \u0026#8220joint development partnership\u0026#8221 to finance a new hotel in Shetland, which they claim will unlock \u0026#8220development potential in the isles\u0026#8221.\nBut the council\u0026#8217s communications department said that the authority could not yet comment on the proposals because the letter had not arrived.\nThe firm announced plans for expansion on Monday as its newest hotel, located in Stirling city centre, opened.\nTravelodge\u0026#8217s plans have seen them write to 20 local authorities across Scotland, with Kirkwall in Orkney also on the firm\u0026#8217s radar.\nIf successful the company claims the expansion will represent an investment of £125 million and could create 385 new jobs.\nAccording to the chain, the letter to the SIC outlines how it has worked alongside 12 local authorities in England and Wales to create jobs and boost the economy.\nTravelodge believes it can do the same for Shetland, which it has identified as an \u0026#8220up-and-coming tourist destination\u0026#8221, and in doing so help the council to achieve its aims of increasing visitor numbers.\nAgreements between the hotel chain and local authorities have had unique funding structures, Travelodge said. Hotels have been built on surplus local authority land, with funding provided either through internal council resources, the Public Works Loan Board or third-party resources.\nUpon completion, local authorities can choose to either retain ownership of the hotel, receiving an annual rent, or sell the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.\nTravelodge chairman Brian Wallace said: \u0026#8220Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.\u0026#8221\nHe added: \u0026#8220We want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Lerwick. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Shetland Islands Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.\u0026#8221\n \u0026raquo\nHope it\u0026#8217s cleaner than the one in Bridge St / union St  Aberdeen\nI\u0026#8217d hope it would be staffed by locals here and they would have more pride in their work, saying that ive been in London Edinburgh Glasgow and Aberdeen ones and they have always been spotless\nSo, Travelodge wants to build a bland uninspiring hotel in Shetland and it wants SIC to pay for it. Really ? I think they are taking the ****. How about, they discuss with SIC and the existing Shetland tourism providers to see if another hotel is needed and if so, they pay for it. If they have a good business case they should have no problem is raising the necessary funds for the venture.\nI would suggest that people interested in the Travelodge empire google Travelodge owners .  It quickly becomes evident that it is a huge money making business which is definitely not in need of financial support from Shetland.  What a nerve these people have.  They may argue that a hotel in the Isles would be beneficial and it would be ————- to their enormous assets.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16?

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.

The wooden boat was taking in water in rough seas in the Roost.\n into Lerwick harbour.\nShetland Coastguard watch officer Alex Dodge said: “The 14 on board were all safe and well. The skipper handled the situation extremely well.”\nThe 40-year-old converted fishing boat, with an all-female crew and female passengers, was heading to Shetland for a diving trip, and will be in the isles for the next few weeks.\n since January last year and has 22 years experience as a power boat instructor, said she called the coastguard as a precaution.\n was [originally] a fishing boat and well able for the conditions.”\nThe problem started when the boat began taking in water from the rudder gland and a deck hatch, she said. The boat was equipped with a three bilge-pump system but one of the pumps had failed, meaning they only had one as back-up. Ms Weaver said: “We try to be two failures away from a problem.” Also, she said, she had to “err on the side of caution” because the boat was carrying 12 passengers.\n was able to proceed “under her own power and pumping under her own power” into Lerwick. She is currently in the small boat harbour.\n and two sunken klondykers.\n is used for various types of dive trips, including recreational and wreck diving in locations in Orkney and Shetland, including Scapa Flow and Fair Isle as well as in northern Scotland and Faroe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]
