At the meeting of party officials Monday, Kim discussed the \u0027development of the north-south relations at present and the prospect of the DPRK-US dialogue\u0027If the summit does take place, many remain skeptical about the whether a meeting between the two notoriously unpredictable leaders can succeed.It is scheduled to take place without the months of groundwork that usually precedes such meetings.No specifics have yet emerged concerning the date or venue of the proposed summit, with a third country such as Mongolia or Sweden under consideration to host the talks, according to multiple reports.Beyond that, a detailed agenda for the talks will need to be set.Washington\u0027s long-held stance is that it will not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea. That means it wants to see \u0027complete, verifiable, and irreversible\u0027 denuclearize, which is a very high bar from North Korea\u0027s perspective.The North has previously demanded the withdrawal of US troops based in the South and the end of the security alliance between Seoul and Washington, which is an extraordinary concession that it is hard to imagine any previous US president agreeing to."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/05/4B0000D600000578-0-image-m-22_1523333847435.jpg","title":"Shocking moment hit run driver aggressively runs motorcyclist Florida","story":"Police are still searching for a vehicle involved in an aggravated battery incident that occurred Sunday in Sarasota, Florida  The incident occurred around 5:00 p.m after deputies were alerted to a possible road rage incident near the intersection of Beneva Road and Riviera DriveRevenge served HOT: The moment a woman sets her cheating...New Jersey cop is suspended and charged with assault after...Share this articlePolice are still searching for the driver of the car and the Sarasota County Sheriff\u0027s Office is asking for the public’s help to identify them. The Mazda appears to be grey in color, with a large white decal on the back window. Anyone with information related to this incident, vehicle or possible driver is asked to contact the Criminal Investigations Section at 941.861.4317."},{"url":null,"title":"Spanish newspaper boss misses chair tumbles floor screaming live interview","story":"    Bieito Rubido Ramonde, director of Spain\u0027s third largest newspaper ABC (pictured left), took a tumble on live television Rubido Ramonde springs to his feet as the host peers over to producers, uttering under his breath: \u0027Oops, he fell over.\u0027The presenter rushes to his aid and asks: \u0027Are you okay?

Will it work?It’s Good Friday in Brisbane and most of the city is dead quiet, with pubs and clubs not opening until midnight due to Easter trading laws. In the inner suburb of West End, however, something very noisy is stirring.On a makeshift stage in a large room, a three-piece band called Hexmere is playing a raucous, raw brand of grindcore punk to a small crowd. There’s another gig planned for the following night, with many more people expected.These all-ages shows are being sporadically staged by the Outer Space art collective, which won the Brisbane city council’s tender to operate this 300-capacity venue for two years, rent-free. The space needs work. But it represents an experiment, a gamble and a new hope for the city’s youth culture.The fact that the city council chose to make the space available is important. Despite a rich history, live music in Brisbane, as in so many other cities around the world, struggles to survive against the pressures of gentrification, regulation and competition.The music industry’s inextricable links to alcohol and bars has left a dearth of venues accessible to under-18s, raising concerns about how the complex ecosystem that sustains a vibrant local music scene – comprising everything from record shops to independent labels to public radio – will reproduce itself without engaging audiences from a young age.Live from Outer Space is an attempt to buck that trend in Brisbane. Coordinator Alex Campbell watches Hexmere as sound technician Hannah buzzes around the room, checking noise levels and sonic balance. Campbell says she has encouraged women and non-binary people to get involved in the male-dominated space of sound engineering especially.In the crowd tonight are the three members of the Goon Sax, back home in Brisbane after seven months in Berlin. Their 19-year-old frontman, Louis Forster, is the son of the Go-Betweens’ Robert – less than half a mile from the venue, the Go Between Bridge s the Brisbane river. But surfing the city’s next wave hasn’t been easy, even for a band with such pedigree.While the Goon Sax’s members were under 18, the venues they played required them to be accompanied by a parent and to leave immediately after their set, while their friends were unable to attend.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.“It’s cool something like this has opened up,” says Forster. “I know my sister’s psyched about it – she’s 16 and she’s coming tomorrow night. I was pretty frustrated by it when I was a kid growing up. I remember going to soundchecks and standing outside venues and listening, stuff like that.”Brisbane takes some pride in its musical past – another international export, the Saints, are the subject of a mural celebrating their achievements on the other side of the river, and the band’s guitarist Ed Kuepper has a local park named after him. But the council’s decision to back Outer Space represents a recognition of the need to invest in the city’s cultural future.“There’s all these young kids who don’t have any places to go,” says Louis Whelan, who is director of Outer Space’s all-ages live-music programme and also plays in his own band, the Mouldy Lovers. “Most events are really alcohol-focused. Playing somewhere where people are just going to get wasted, it’s not the same thing as playing where people want to see music.“If there’s a whole new generation of people who are much more engaged with the arts and music, then when they get out and they have disposable incomes, they’re going to go to galleries, to venues, to buy local bands’ music and start their own labels. I think there’s a lot of value in it.”It’s not just kids who are struggling to find places to play. In Sydney – once a live-music Mecca to rival London or New York – bands now struggle to play at all, with venues under pressure from soaring real estate prices, noise complaints, punitive regulations and a cosy relationship between government and developers. The city’s longest-serving live venue, The Basement – which, over 45 years, has hosted artists from Dizzy Gillespie to Prince – closed last week, though its owners are hopeful of finding other premises.The situation has become so difficult that the state of New South Wales is now holding a parliamentary inquiry. Dave Faulkner, singer and songwriter of enduring Australian garage band the Hoodoo Gurus, told the inquiry that live music was treated like the sex industry, “as something to be shunned. We employ so many people, we generate incredible amounts of money throughout the economy – and yet we’re treated so badly.”Faced with similar issues, music scenes around the world have been forced underground, into house parties or often illegal warehouse gigs, accessible only to those in the know. “It starts to get a bit worrying when kids are in those scenes,” says Emily Collins, managing director of the government-funded advocacy body MusicNSW. “We’d much rather them be in venues where we can make sure it’s safe and they can learn to love music in a safe and supporting environment. At warehouse parties there are no security guards, there’s no regulation, no one monitoring alcohol consumption. And they’re more focused on over-18 activities anyway – not that anyone is checking ID.”All-ages shows have a twofold benefit, says Collins: they foster a self-sustaining community of audiences and performers that in turn helps nurture a creative city. The sticking point, particularly in Australia, is breaking the nexus between music and alcohol.Venues, already under severe financial duress, are reluctant to put on events where no money is coming over the bar and the regulatory environment is forbidding. “There are multiple bodies that need to be satisfied, so there is considerable complexity, high costs and red tape in running a compliant venue,” says Julian Knowles, chair of MusicNSW and a professor of music at Macquarie University.“There is no ‘agent of change’ law in New South Wales that puts the responsibility on developers to soundproof new developments near music venues. If new residents make noise complaints, the venue is held accountable and must meet acoustic treatment costs, so it’s very risky for venue operators. At best, it erodes business confidence and at worst it can shut down venues entirely.”The introduction of controversial lockout laws in 2014, imposing curfews on venues in a bid to curb alcohol-related violence more associated with nightclubs than live music events, have been relaxed to some degree, but otherwise only worsened the operating environment.Against this backdrop, MusicNSW offers funding to promoters and venues to stage all-ages shows, but Collins says applications are few. “People say it’s too hard as a venue – $15,000 won’t cut it.”Often bands are paid literally out of beer takings. “They’re basically saying: the more heavy drinkers attend your gig, the better you’ll get paid,” says Ray Ahn, bass player of another longstanding punk band, the Hard-Ons. “With that kind of a working model, it’s harder to organise all-ages shows. Where’s the money going to come from?”The parliamentary inquiry underlines what a cautionary tale Sydney has become. Dave Faulkner said the city’s culture was dying. “When people come to Sydney they don’t just come to see the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, they also go to have a night out and to see music – it’s what I do when I go to London or New York. But Sydney has been doing everything it can to destroy those places of entertainment and turn them into apartment buildings.”In the late 70s and early 80s, hundreds of pubs and clubs throughout the city and suburbs kept artists busy, with major Australian bands such as Midnight Oil honing their live skills by playing upwards of 200 shows a year.From the late 80s to the early 90s, Ahn says, the Hard-Ons would often play an all-ages show in the afternoon and another for over-18s in the evening. Now, they might have played one all-ages show in Australia in the last 10 years. When the band tour Europe or Japan, though, it’s a different story.“A lot of the shows we do in Europe are in purpose-built halls that have the bar on the outside,” Ahn says. “Inside, there is no bar – it’s like a flat-ceilinged room with a massive PA and volunteers running around everywhere. So where are they getting the money from? They’re getting it from the city council.”The environment in Germany was more easygoing, says Louis Forster, even when he was younger. “I spent a lot of time there growing up, and I could always get into venues – it was never a problem. Parents would bring their kids to shows, which was really fantastic.”In Australia, Melbourne actively promotes itself as the live-music capital, and with good reason. A Deloitte study in 2011 valued the sector’s economic contribution at over half a billion dollars, with small venues providing the bulk of revenue and employment. Though many venues have closed in recent years, the value of investing in the live-music sector at grassroots level has long been recognised.The Push, a not-for-profit youth music organisation, has been operating in Victoria since 1986, providing a launch platform for countless bands. As well as all-ages shows, it puts on mentoring programmes and skills workshops.Shaad D’Souza, a music journalist who used to coordinate all-ages events for the organisation, notes that it is a cultural investment as well as a financial one. “Lots of kids, when they grow up they’ll only really go to big festivals or big arena shows because that’s all they’ve had access to,” he says. “Whereas if you’re investing in all-ages shows, they develop a relationship with venues, they develop a relationship with artists, and then they know: ‘I want to support my local scene.’ They want to go to smaller venues they don’t just want to go to arena shows or festivals.”At the end of the night, Alex Campbell’s band, Bad Bangers, will launch their EP. The band are in their 20s now. “But that’s kind of why we started this – because there weren’t many all-ages spaces when we were younger.”In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

In the most recent edition, Melbourne was declared the world’s most liveable city for the seventh year running, with Adelaide fifth, Perth seventh, Sydney 11th and Brisbane 16th.Yet from long commutes and high car dependency to the low provision of affordable housing in the more appealing areas, Australian cities still have plenty of room for improvement.The Centre for Urban Research’s Creating Liveable Cities in Australia report provides the first baseline measure of liveability in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra, Darwin and Hobart. The result of five years of research, it examines walkability, public transport, public open spaces, housing affordability, commuting and access to food and alcohol.The walkability index combines dwelling density, daily-living destinations and street connectivity. It showed that a minority of residents in Australians cities live in walkable communities. With few exceptions, walkability is generally concentrated in inner suburbs. Despite the health and environmental benefits of walking, Australian cities are still being designed for cars. One notable exception was found: some new, walkable areas being built in outer-suburban Perth.In Sydney and Brisbane particularly, housing affordability stress is spread across large areas of the city. However, in all cities, those suburbs enduring the greatest stress were located towards the urban fringe. Given that outer suburbs also have poor access to public transport, and are less likely to be walkable, household expenditure on cars is likely to be higher there than in other areas. This suggests that continued suburban expansion will not improve housing affordability. Unlike other indicators of liveability, outer suburban areas mostly have better access to public open space than inner-city areas. Across Melbourne, Perth, Sydney and Brisbane, there are more fast-food outlets on average than supermarkets within 3.2km of residents’ homes.Previous research has shown that in Melbourne the density of off-licences in disadvantaged areas corresponded to poorer self-rated health. This reflects other Australian research showing that the density of alcohol outlets is associated with harmful alcohol consumption and alcohol-related violence, and that more alcohol outlets appear to be located in more disadvantaged areas.Due to difficulties in obtaining alcohol data, these indicators were created for only four cities: Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Sydney.

Reinstating the Irish border would be an enormous setbackTwenty years ago, the Good FridayBelfast agreement helped bring an end to decades of conflict and violence in Northern Ireland. It was a watershed moment – the result of diplomatic efforts within the halls of government and extraordinary actions of ordinary women and men who reached across longstanding and bitter ides.Today, the agreement stands not only as a local framework for shared understanding, but as a shining example of what’s possible when citizens come together to demand peace, and preserve it across generations. As the world celebrates this significant anniversary, we must also remain vigilant in protecting the agreement in the face of our current challenges – from the uncertainties heralded by Brexit to the hurdles posed by the impasse in devolved government in Northern Ireland – and do all we can to deliver on the unrealised aspirations of human rights and equality that were espoused that day in April 1998.Even now, I can picture clearly my husband’s first trip to Northern Ireland as president. On a cold winter night in 1995, Bill and I joined thousands of people at Belfast city hall for the lighting of the Christmas tree. As Catholics and Protestants alike came to that spot from their deeply ided neighbourhoods, there was no guarantee that violence wouldn’t break out yet they came with a sense of hope, after so many seasons of darkness.It was on that same trip that I first met some of the women whose names are too often forgotten, despite their vital role in the agreement. One of those women was Joyce McCartan, a Catholic mother whose 17-year-old son had been shot dead by a Protestant gunman. Joyce invited me to join women from both traditions at the safe house she had set up in a local fish and chip shop. We sat around a small table, drinking tea out of an old aluminium teapot, while the women told me how they had first reached across their ides to band together to stop the price of their children’s milk from going up. Along the way, they discovered that the deep-rooted causes of the violence – the terrors of sectarianism, the burdens of poverty, the despair of unemployment – touched all of their lives. In the end, for them and for so many women across Northern Ireland, love of family ran deeper than calls to hatred.Though they may not have made the headlines or the history books, those kitchen-table conversations were essential to the peace process. So were all the women who came together to form a coalition and claim a formal seat at the table – women like Avila Kilmurray, Monica McWilliams, Pearl Sagar, May Blood and so many more who moved mountains to help negotiate the Good Friday agreement years ago at Stormont.There are some who argue that the agreement has outlived its usefulness. They are wrong. Countless people in Northern Ireland are alive today, rather than in early graves, because of it. The last thing we can afford to do is become complacent, or delude ourselves into thinking our work is finished. In fact, 20 years later, crucial components of the agreement still have yet to be implemented. An integrated education system and support for community development, the promotion of the representation of women, and a bill of rights for Northern Ireland are all promises that have yet to be realised. The fact that the Civic Forum has fallen by the wayside is especially tragic, since it would offer a venue to discuss many of the urgent issues facing Northern Ireland today, including the possible outcomes of Brexit negotiations.These are difficult times for Northern Ireland, and for our world. As the Brexit debate rages on, I continue to believe in the value of the European Union, and of a Europe that is whole, free and at peace. But no matter the outcome of these discussions, we cannot allow Brexit to undermine the peace that people voted, fought and even died for. Reinstating the border would be an enormous setback, returning to the “bad old days” when communities would once again be set apart.Two decades ago, it was acknowledged that just as the Troubles didn’t start overnight, peace was never going to come overnight. Now, as the world celebrates this significant anniversary, the principles the agreement represented in the first place are more important than ever: a commitment to peace, prosperity and healing as the people of Northern Ireland build a shared future. As Avila and Monica recently wrote, if short-term interests take precedence over solving the long-term challenges that still exist in Northern Ireland, “then it is clear that the hand of history will be both heavy and unforgiving”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b885f6f79b0ed273ba39a560dc5ee4734f867ad3/0_34_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a387fa841ea0f9669b3a7b9d867f3cea 1240w","title":"may syrian uk intervene","story":"Hand in hand, they emerged from the White House, and she has never quite recovered from it. The moment Donald Trump clamped his paw over Theresa May’s sent a collective shudder through not just viewers at home, but Downing Street staffers too. The prime minister went to Washington grimly determined to prove that whatever her personal feelings about Trump, the special relationship between the two nations endured, only to prove there’s such a thing as too special by half.But now the limits of that relationship face a far more serious test. The US clearly intends to punish the Assad regime and its Russian backers for the atrocity in Douma, while stopping well short of anything resembling a ground war. And this time it doesn’t wish to be seen as going it alone, which means enlisting the practical or political support of Britain and France in bombing raids. Trump’s hand is on May’s sleeve again, forcing her to choose between an acquiescence that may turn stomachs at home and a rejection that would offend Britain’s most powerful ally.Already siren voices are whispering that she can’t afford to lose any more credibility on the world stage, now Brexit has shattered our historic claim to being America’s hotline to the EU and vice versa. That it was France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, that Trump called first to discuss Syria is a clear sign we’re out in the cold. True, May could still command powerful allies’ backing in her showdown with Moscow over the Salisbury poisoning. But if anything, that creates an expectation of reciprocity. Hasn’t she just been arguing that the west must unite against Russian aggression, that the use of chemical weapons in Wiltshire threatened rules-based world order?Yet if May is seen to be backing airstrikes just to curry favour with an increasingly erratic US, she won’t even carry a vote in parliament, let alone the nation. If it was hard enough for many to swallow the idea of standing shoulder to shoulder with George W Bush – imagine doing so with Trump as he blunders around the Middle East while blustering his way through the Stormy Daniels scandal at home. At least with Bush there was a possibility, however slim, of his heeding London’s advice at key moments in return for unflinching support. Who seriously imagines Trump in listening mode?So somehow, May needs to turn this into a decision made strictly on merit, free from the ghosts of the past, rather than a referendum on transatlantic relationships. She should be very publicly weighing the risks of being sucked into a proxy war between superpowers or regional powers against the equally grave risks of allowing Russian aggression to continue unchecked or chemical warfare to be normalised. We need to hear about the prospects for a successful intervention that saves lives versus the risk of making another futile or counter-productive gesture that would cost them, not about how this affects Britain’s international clout. All of which means the specific (and so far unknown) details of how, when and where the US proposes to act are crucial. Beware anyone who claims the answers are obvious.The underlying judgment is no easier now than in 2013. Military intervention can have terrifying consequences, but so can non-intervention. Calling for further inquiries to establish Syrian guilt just as previous inquiries into previous atrocities have done is likely, at best, to delay rather than remove the decision. Anyone arguing for a peaceful negotiated solution must explain how that is to happen when President Assad patently isn’t negotiating (why would he, with victory in sight?).But what’s often lost in raking over that shameful night in 2013, when in a bewildering welter of amendments and counter-amendments in parliament stopped David Cameron authorising bombing raids on Syria, is precisely why it was shaming. It isn’t just about the Syrian lives subsequently lost but the powerful sense in the Commons that night that somehow nobody had won that whatever one’s view of the decision, British democracy had stumbled to it for the wrong reasons. Even some of Ed Miliband’s team seemed oddly spooked by their victory. To them, this was a vote on one specific, hastily announced and badly explained US plan to bomb Syria imminently, and for obvious reasons they balked at being bounced once again into supporting American military action, no questions asked. They didn’t necessarily see it as the final word on intervention in Syria, yet that is what it became.

They don’t care for chickens washed in chlorine, nor for cows stuffed with hormones. But this week, an epic US document setting out the barriers to foreign trade it would like to remove shows that these concerns are just the tip of the iceberg.So a US trade deal could be both bad for our health, and bad for helping us get better again. In its report, the US government is clear that it hates the EU’s food policies. It wants to export chlorinated chicken (meat rinsed in antimicrobial wash as an alternative to keeping and killing animals in healthy conditions), and meat from animals stuffed with hormones, steroids, ractopamine, and endocrine disrupters (chemicals that mess with animals’ hormones and can cause cancer and birth defects).The list goes on, with the US unhappy about the EU’s “cautious” approach to approving genetically modified goods, chemical flavourings in food and the amount of pesticide residue allowed in fruits and nuts. They even think the amount of “somatic cells” allowed in milk in the EU is too restrictive. The US allows more white blood cells in milk than anywhere else in the world, even though this often indicates infection in the cow.The US argues that this is a matter of customer choice. But that’s disingenuous, both because importing this food will inevitably drive down standards here, and because, as we discover in the document, the US dislikes the sort of food labelling that allows the consumer to make an informed choice.If all of this is starting to make you feel queasy, it gets worse when you look at the “treatment” side of the equation. Medicines in the US are vastly more expensive than they are in Europe. So it’s little wonder that the US, batting for big pharma, disagrees with the (still very moderate) limitations many European governments place on pharmaceutical corporations.For starters, the US complains that there is “a lack of meaningful stakeholder input” into these policies. In turn this creates “uncertainty and unpredictability” and can “undermine incentives to market and innovate further”.In Britain, for instance, the NHS has some limited power to negotiate the price of medicines. It also has a framework for what is and isn’t “value for money”. None of this is to the taste of the US administration. Indeed, it even has a problem with the (again very limited) transparency the EU forces on pharmaceutical corporations to disclose drug trial dates. Drug trials are notoriously opaque, with vital information routinely withheld from the public, making it harder to scrutinise prices or even the real efficacy of medicines.This is the same agenda that the US has been pursuing in other trade deals. The American campaign group Public Citizen shows how the US routinely pushes for greater monopoly rights for pharmaceutical companies in trade deals. On the government’s list are demands to make it easier to renew patents on medicines, allow an even greater degree of corporate control over clinical test data, grant new patents on biological medicines (including many new cancer treatments) and give corporations a greater say in healthcare policy.All of this amounts to a simple reality: if the US successfully pushes through these top-line demands in a trade deal with the UK, the NHS would either have to spend more money on drugs each year, or more patients would be denied access to those drugs.The secretive US-UK trade working group, led by the trade secretary, Liam Fox, met two weeks ago. We are not allowed to know much about the talks, but we do know that “services, investment, intellectual property rights and enforcement, regulatory issues” were discussed. That means: all of the above. Changes in regulatory standards on food and healthcare will be the price Trump charges for a trade deal with the UK. And we know that Fox himself has few qualms about lower food standards.Second, the trade bill, shelved for the time being as Theresa May fears losing a vote on the customs union, will have to return to parliament soon. MPs must take this opportunity to vote for powers to properly scrutinise the trade secretary and to have the right to stop trade deals they don’t like. The stakes couldn’t be higher. If we don’t want to give in to Trump’s trade demands, we must make trade policy democratic.• Nick Dearden is director of Global Justice Now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1492e0e13c7dc32017a66fbc6e33bdd8e853eb6/628_1529_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dc75e04c19daf1588f4fbce39f5ae99f 1240w","title":"tiny violins moaning pretty being beautiful blessing curse samantha brick","story":"Being beautiful mainly seems a blessing. But it can be a curse – and the main problem is that you are just not allowed to complain about itIt’s tough being beautiful. Other women, women who are not so genetically blessed, despise you, you see. They worry you will steal their husband. They get together with their average-looking friends and say nasty things behind your inordinately elegant back. They think that, just because you have flawless skin, you don’t have feelings. But you do have feelings: tragically, the world can’t look past your cut-glass cheekbones and understand that.If you have ever wondered What It’s Like to Go Through Life As a Really Beautiful Woman, this is about the sum of it, apparently. At least, according to an article published last week on New York magazine’s lifestyle website, the Cut. In it, an anonymous woman in her late 50s explains that being attractive opened a lot of doors for her in life, but also made women hate her. I’m fairly sure the beautiful-but-damned subject of the article wasn’t Samantha Brick, but it is very much reminiscent of her infamous 2012 magnum opus in the Daily Mail, There are Downsides to Looking This Pretty: Why Women Hate Me for Being Beautiful. And, like Brick’s much-laughed-at lament, it was immediately and mercilessly mocked on social media.Rightly so. The article reads like a parody, parroting tiresome tropes about jealous, catty women. Yet it’s a shame the response to the piece descended so swiftly into jeers. There is an interesting and important conversation to be had about what it’s like to go through life as a really beautiful woman – or a very handsome man. Looks aren’t everything, but count for a lot. We might not like to admit it, but we are all prone to treating people differently according to their appearance. Studies show that even babies prefer looking at more attractive faces. But while we are all affected by beauty biases, I’m not sure we are often prompted to examine and curb them – and they have real repercussions.But while beauty mainly seems to be a blessing, it can also be a curse. Being considered attractive works against you if you are a woman applying for a traditionally “masculine” job, for example. In 2015, a study from University College London’s School of Management found that while handsome men are seen as more competent, this makes them less likely to be hired in competitive workplaces because they are perceived as a threat. Funny, isn’t it? Despite there being clear evidence that men can be threatened by other men’s looks, they are rarely accused of same-sex jealousy in the way women are. It is almost as if society goes out of its way to pit women against each other.Ultimately, it seems that the main problem with being attractive is that people are not allowed to complain about it. As articles like the one in the Cut make clear, nothing brings out the sarcastic tiny violins faster than someone moaning about the pitfalls of aesthetic perfection. While that may be understandable, I think it is also worth understanding that society sometimes penalises prettiness. Let’s not be so quick to hate on people just because they write op-eds about being beautiful.It’s a big week for Mark Zuckerberg, who is appearing in front of Congress to apologise for inadvertently undermining democracy. Facebook reportedly prepared for this personal responsibility (PR) exercise by bringing in an army of experts to give its CEO a “crash course” in charm – a quality the ZuckBot is not known for.What does this charm curriculum comprise? If I happened to control a complex system of mass surveillance or was as good at hacking as certain Tory MPs, I would be able to tell you in detail. Sadly, this is not the case. So, I can only speculate that preparations kicked off with careful scrutiny of the personal data of all the politicians Zuck will be meeting. People like it when you ask them about themselves, Mark! Why not try asking that congressman, you know, the one who has been having a secret affair for the past three months, how he liked the new carbonara recipe he tried the other day?Facebook being Facebook, I imagine some fancy tech was involved in updating MZ’s interpersonal operating system. An empathy algorithm, perhaps, devised to recommend meaningful semantic structures that build a sense of genuine community. Or maybe there is proprietary communication code that prompts Zuckerberg to nod and say “yes” at regular intervals to make it seem as if he is actually listening and not just counting the minutes until he can escape from having to interact with mere mortals.Or maybe charm training was a little more analogue than that. Perhaps Zuckerberg was just advised to take off that unflattering T-shirt and wear a suit. Perhaps he was told to say the word “sorry” a statistically significant number of times. After all, if you repeat any old nonsense long enough, people will believe it. Facebook knows that better than just about anyone.One day you tweet a question about whether snakes fart, the next you’ve landed a book deal about animal flatulence. Well, Dani Rabaiotti knows how it is, anyway. Last year, the environmental scientist sent a tweet that turned into a viral hashtag (#doesitfart) that turned into a book called Does It Fart: the Definitive Field Guide to Animal Flatulence. This includes must-know information such as the fact that sloths don’t break wind. Meanwhile, seal farts smell like fish, while herrings use their liberated gas to communicate with each other, much like small children. The book only came out in the US last week, but it was released in Britain last year. I guess the UK is inordinately receptive to hot air."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34dd078b4ba9ead33da95099dc02666aeb913f42/259_0_3957_2376/master/3957.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d6688aae128074f6f326fb553dd4c467 1240w","title":"women teachers strikes america","story":"The spreading teachers strikes are for wages and benefits – but they arise from a social landscape scoured by gender and racial inequalitiesThe US is in the grip of a wave of strikes in our public schools. As a national organizer for International Women’s Strike, which took place on 8 March let me also add: “at last”!The mainstream US media have been generally supportive of the strikes. They have highlighted how decades of neoliberal cuts to public education have kindled these flames. They have talked about stagnant salaries mean teachers are unable to keep pace with the rising cost of healthcare. What they have not talked about is this: the strike action is led almost exclusively by women. I have spent many hours talking with striking teachers, chanting with them in their statehouses. This movement has to be recognized as a feminist project, and all feminists need to stand with the teachers. 2. The prevalence of women in this sector is undergirded by a more complex issue. Teaching is seen as “women’s work.” While the majority of teachers used to be male in the colonial period, the feminization of the sector began around 1900. Indeed, some scholars believe that feminization took place because schools were reluctant to pay the former high wages that male teachers received as the school term got longer with the spread of public education. Other scholars have demonstrated how the preponderance of women “has contributed to pressure to strengthen bureaucratic controls over teacher behaviour and to ’deskill’ the profession.” Funny how vicious this circle is. Teaching is seen as women’s work and hence teachers are paid badly. Because the vast majority of teachers are women, a formerly male profession suddenly becomes women’s work.3. Since it is labelled women’s work, teaching then also gets classified as ”care work”. My friend, the economist Nancy Folbre, has done several extensive studies on the devaluation of care work, and she lists teachers, nurses, and child care workers as the most prominent examples of this devaluation. But for these teachers, “care” extends beyond the classroom. Most of the strikes are happening in the poorest parts of the country. Many students in these teachers’ classrooms get their only hot meal of the day in school. In all strike locations, teachers have organized for their students to have hot lunches. Jackie, a teacher from the successful West Virginia strike, who came from a small town in Blacksville, told me that throughout the strike they kept their city hall open where the children came in to be fed. Teachers are working with churches to prepare hot meals and take them to people’s houses. 5. Since women are the caregivers at home, all attacks on healthcare and childcare are women’s issues. We know that Oklahoma, a state where the teachers are still on strike, has, over the years, cut funding for mental health and done away with earned tax credits for the poorest families. It now ranks, along with West Virginia and Montana as leading the country in adverse childhood experiences. The teachers also had to wear Fitbits and enter data about every bodily measurements and functions, including sexual activity. Their premiums were to be decided on how well they did on such metrics. 6. Let us remember that teachers are not just women workers. They carry their gender home even after the last bell. The politicians in the states where the strikes are taking place, have, over the years, shown their deep commitment to generalized misogyny:Rebecca in Arizona is not just a strike leader, she is the mother of three children under four. Carol Roskos in West Virginia is worried about children who live in abusive homes, but the state has cut funding needed to find alternatives for them. A substitute teacher in Kentucky wrote in a secret Facebook group “I just sit here and think of a 15-month-old baby girl in my family and I am petrified about her future.”These strikes are for wages and benefits, but they arise from a social landscape scoured by gender and racial inequalities. The leaders of the strikes are thus not simply workers shaped only by conditions of work: gender marks them.These are women fighting for dignity and security in the most commodious sense of those terms. Their gender is not incidental to this strike, their narratives of fear about their families and health, are not backstories to what is merely a wage struggle. It is time to consider these ‘backstories’ as central and constitutive of the strike wave.

I am sure a lot of you can relate. However, the good news is that there are nourishing ways to get your skin back on track. Here are my tips for getting out of that dry, patchy phase.Before I apply a moisturising cream, I use a serum. My favourite is Bare Minerals Skinlongevity Vital Power serum (Bare Minerals, £48), which hydrates my skin and preps it for my facial cream. This serum has a light but moisturising texture, which quickly soaks into the skin and makes it feel more hydrated. I then immediately apply my facial cream to add extra moisture. I like to use NSPA Expert Daily-Rejuvenate cream SPF-30 (Asda, £10) as it has a creamy texture perfect for keeping it hydrated all day.I then use a moisturising primer, which is cream-based rather than silicone-based to give my skin additional moisture. I use Huda Beauty Complexion Perfection Pre-makeup Base (Selfridges, £27), as it has a velvety smooth finish, which is perfect for filling in the pores and smoothing over imperfections before applying foundation, while keeping your skin super-hydrated.I begin my makeup with a serum-based foundation, which gives my skin a dewy finish. I use MDMflow Flawless Base Foundation (Indiegogo, £10 available to pre-order), in shade 802. This foundation has a light texture that gives a natural glow, while keeping your skin hydrated.When it comes to the rest of my makeup, I use the most moisture-rich products I can find. For example, I opt for creamy eyeshadows such as the Sleek MakeUP Bronze I Lust palette (Boots, £7.49) and a waterproof mascara such as Benefit’s BADgal BANG! (benefitcosmetics.com, £21.50) to achieve a long-lasting finish.Lips tend to take the brunt of a shift in temperature, so it is important to keep them hydrated. Applying a satin lipstick is the best way to keep lips soft and moisturised. I use the Inglot LipSatin Lipstick (Inglot, £13), in shade 301, to add a little colour to my lips. I also use it as a blusher, using my fingers to blend on to my cheeks with patting motions.I love finishing my hydrating look with the NYX Professional Makeup Dewy Finish Setting Spray (Boots, £7), which rehydrates the face and ensues your makeup lasts longer. A setting spray is a good replacement for powder as it also locks in makeup without drying your skin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7138166fad451e6d457fe3908f27b04548b45d1/0_57_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=23ef93dc43ff46d866038304a5120783 1240w","title":"cannes film festival 2018 netflix feud","story":"Cannes will announce its 2018 lineup shortly, but new films by Netflix are likely to be notable for their absence. It’s a conflict that could have major ramifications for the industryThe Cannes film festival boasts some of the noisiest audiences in the world – and if they don’t like your movie, you’ll soon know about it. A few years ago, before they were reupholstered, the seats in the 2,300-capacity Grand Theatre Lumière would automatically flip up, making a booming sound to mark the early exit of disgruntled critics. Booing and jeering are common when the end credits roll. But last year’s festival marked a first: at several screenings, audiences took to hissing and whistling before the movie had even started.The focus of their wrath was the Netflix logo that preceded Bong Joon-ho’s Okja and Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories. It was the first time the streaming platform had been accepted into the main competition and the pushback was immediate. Film purists were already upset by the festival’s embrace of TV series, with Jane Campion’s Top of the Lake and David Lynch’s return to Twin Peaks both given special screenings. But Netflix proved a bridge too far. In France, a film can’t appear on streaming platforms until 36 months after its release in cinemas, but Netflix’s films didn’t get even a token cinema release. There is a rumour that the Cannes protests were orchestrated via a text message sent by French exhibitors.Festival director Thierry Frémaux responded quickly to the fuss, imposing a ban on streaming films in competition from 2018 – a move that prompted Netflix boss Ted Sarandos to comment simply, and darkly, that the company, which is set to invest $8bn in content this year, now found Cannes a “less attractive” prospect. Nearly a year on, Sarandos and the festival seemed to have buried the hatchet, and the reports in the trades are that five Netflix films had actually been accepted by the festival. But Frémaux reopened the wound in March, in a controversial interview with Le Film Francais. As well as revealing his plans to dispense with early morning press screenings and ban selfies on the red carpet, Frémaux slightly rephrased the previous year’s embargo: streaming films, he said, would be welcome in Out of Competition slots.Now it seems likely that Netflix was playing a longer game. This week, in the run-up to the announcement of the festival’s official selection, came news that Netflix was about to withdraw its five titles – a piece of brinksmanship designed to ruffle festival programmers, who famously go to the wire, with Frémaux sometimes making vital decisions in the early hours of the night before the press conference.Netflix has so far not commented on the impasse, or even acknowledged it, but, if true, the withdrawals could blast a big hole in the Cannes lineup. It would mean that Oscar winner Alfonso Cuarón will miss out on his Cannes feature debut, for his Mexico-set drama Roma Paul Greengrass, who has been only once, with his 911 film United 93, will not be bringing his new project Norway, the story of white-supremacist killer Anders Breivik and Cannes regular Jeremy Saulnier will be denied a step up from Directors Fortnight with his new film Hold the Dark, a dark, Alaskan-set thriller starring Alexander Skarsgård.But likely to strike even closer to Frémaux’s heart would be the retraction of Morgan Neville’s Orson Welles documentary They’ll Love Me When I’m Dead, and a restored version of Welles’s unfinished final film The Other Side of the Wind, a once mythical work that Frémaux surely eyed as a highlight of his always impressive Cannes Classics sidebar.With three days to go, anything is still possible, but the tensions between the festival and streaming services will probably not be going away any time soon, especially if Apple moves on its promise to commit $1bn to TV and film production this year. Traditionally, any high-profile film denied a place at Cannes will find a warm welcome at Venice or Toronto. But the suspicion remains that films financed by streaming services are, to use Frémaux’s term, “hybrids”. It’s not unthinkable to suggest that, in time, these digital platforms might yet team up to found their own festival (indeed, France currently has five TV events, from the long-running Monte Carlo television festival to this year’s inaugural Canneseries) and establish the streaming movie as a genre of its own. While Netflix and Cannes are engaged in a cold war, the fight for the future of cinema is warming up.

The family friendly Beatrix Potter adaptation scored a fourth consecutive weekend at the top spot, with takings of £3.15m taking the tally up to £32.2m. In the past seven days, Peter Rabbit added a mighty £10.6m. Most kids are still on holiday this week, so look for the box-office bonanza to continue. Few films achieve four weeks at the chart summit. Last year, it was a feat that eluded box office giants Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Beauty and the Beast, and was achieved in 2017 only by Dunkirk. This year, Peter Rabbit follows four straight weeks at the top spot for Black Panther – which with £48.4m has just overtaken Avengers: Age of Ultron to become the second biggest Marvel film ever at the UK box office, after Avengers Assemble (£51.9m). The highest new entry in the chart – in second place – is A Quiet Place, the high-concept horror directed by John Krasinski. The Paramount-backed film debuted in the UK with £1.99m over the weekend period, and £2.70m including previews. The obvious comparison for A Quiet Place is Jordan Peele’s Get Out: the surprise breakout genre hit from March last year. Get Out debuted with £2.16m in the UK, on its way to a total of £10.3m. A Quiet Place was also released in North America at the weekend, opening with a mighty $50.2m. Worldwide, it’s at $71.2m. Given that its production budget was just $17m, the film is on track to become a profitable hit, even allowing for significant marketing costs. Films featuring LGBT characters have been hits in the past, notably Brokeback Mountain, which reached $178m worldwide. In the case of teen movies, films with prominent LGBT storylines have tended to exist firmly in the indie sphere – Jamie Babbit’s But I’m a Cheerleader, for example.  Love, Simon is something different. A bright, glossy and unapologetically mainstream US teen movie, Love, Simon has opened in the UK with a robust £1.01m for the weekend period, and £1.18m including previews. Not only is that a record for a gay-themed teen comedy – it’s also the best result for any US teen comedy for quite a while. The genre has been in the doldrums, with teen-targeted hits instead coming from YA adaptations (such as The Maze Runner and The Fault in Our Stars), and before that from dance movies such as the Step Up franchise. The last notable US teen comedy hit was The Hannah Montana Movie, back in 2009 (£8.5m). From the UK, of course, we’ve had The Inbetweeners Movie (£45.0m) and its sequel. Eli Roth’s Death Wish remake, starring Bruce Willis, has bellyflopped at the UK box office, landing in 14th place with £157,000 from 209 cinemas. Death Wish debuted in the US in early March with $13m – by accepted rule of thumb, an equivalent result in the UK market would be around £1.3m, so the achieved outcome is way below that number. Also performing poorly is US indie drama-thriller Thoroughbreds, starring Olivia Cooke and Anya Taylor-Joy as two disaffected teens plotting a murder. The film struggled to define its audience, and has opened with a lacklustre £51,000 from 128 sites. 1. Peter Rabbit, £3,152,269 from 671 sites. Total: £32,223,317 (four weeks) 2.

Bennell, 64, will be eligible for an early release after 15 years but is preparing a case to argue the sentence was excessive.Passing sentence in February, the judge told Bennell a life sentence had been considered because of the “trail of psychological devastation” suffered by the victims and that the severity of the sentence was, in part, because the former coach and talent-spotter had shown no remorse.“Your behaviour towards these boys in grooming and seducing them to, in some cases, the most serious, degrading and humiliating abuse was sheer evil,” Goldstone told him. “You appeared as a god who had it in his gift to help fulfil their ambitions and realise their dreams. In reality you were the devil incarnate. You stole their childhoods and their innocence to satisfy your own perversion.”Bennell, described by the prosecution as an “industrial-scale child molester” and a “predatory and determined paedophile”, has previously served two prison sentences in England, as well as one in the United States, and the judge said the CPS would have to think carefully about pressing more charges when the defendant “may well die in prison”.Eleanor Laws, the barrister defending Bennell, said her client was in remission from cancer, having needed two operations to remove tumours, and was subject to an “onerous” regime that meant he had to be fed via a tube eight times a day. To audible disquiet from the public gallery she said he was on anti-anxiety medication and had undertaken treatment programmes to deal with his paedophilia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fe61277ebbe8890266549b42b99358ccf9ab2d9/0_61_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=39da37aa181941f50a074d8ae8b985dc 1240w","title":"psg new manager thomas tuchel talks antonio conte","story":"PSG are edging closer to deciding who their number-one choice to replace Unai Emry is after meeting Thomas Tuchel’s representatives.

Mauricio Pochettino has also been mentioned as a possible replacement for the Spaniard, whose contract runs out in the summer. The club have already held talks with Conte’s reprentatives, although no formal approach or offer has been made to the Chelsea manager. The Italian has endured a frustrating season at Stamford Bridge, with the team in danger of losing out on a Champions League place for next season. Chelsea were eliminated by Barcelona in the Champions League and their only chance of silverware is the FA Cup, in which they play Southampton in the semi-finals on 22 April. Conte has hinted at his frustration with the club’s transfer policy throughout the season and recently said he was “very angry” and “very sad” about the current situation.Tuchel, meanwhile, has been without a club since leaving Borussia Dortmund in May 2017. He spent two years at the Bundesliga club, following five at Mainz, and was widely admired for the job he did in replacing Jürgen Klopp at the Westfalenstadion. The team played attractive football and reached two cup finals, winning the second one, as well as being Bayern Munich’s main challengers in the league. The manager’s second season at the club, however, was marred by the attack on the team coach before the Champions League quarter-final against Monaco in April 2017.

Yes, I bought Just Seventeen, More, Marie Claire, Elle and Vogue, but the fact that I – and thousands of other women and girls of colour like me – spent our money on glossies did not mean they catered for us. Through ignorance and indifference, they frequently featured no one of black, Asian, mixed or any other ethnic minority heritage from cover to cover, while advice on makeup, skin care, hair styles and products was unfailingly irrelevant to us.New research by the Guardian’s data team shows how little has changed. The covers of some the UK’s most popular monthlies remain overwhelmingly white.For our study, we looked only at publications whose covers mostly featured people and based our calculations on covers that show only one person. The picture is similar if “multi-person” covers are included. The representation problem is not confined to women’s magazines. While GQ featured two black cover models over the year, the other men’s magazine in our study, Men’s Health, had just one. Neither publication featured men from any other minority background.The inclusion of children’s and men’s titles in the Guardian’s research shines a greater light on the state of ersity in magazines, a debate that usually centres on a smaller number of women’s glossy magazines and especially British Vogue. During its former editor Alexandra Shulman’s 25 years at the helm, only two black women were given solo covers. Shulman said in 2012 that, “in a society where the mass of the consumers are white and where, on the whole, mainstream ideas sell, it’s unlikely there will be a huge rise in the number of leading black models”.When Shulman stepped down in 2017, making way for UK Vogue’s first black editor, Edward Enninful, her leaving photo depicted an all-white editorial staff at the magazine.Enninful rebooted interest in the magazine, with a much-celebrated first cover featuring British Ghanaian model Adwoa Aboah – a confident decision that may have stemmed from Enninful’s time at Italian Vogue, where the first ever “black issue” sold so well that an extra 60,000 copies had to be printed. The magazine’s most recent cover headlined “New Frontiers”, was also praised for featuring a erse range of models including Halima Aden, the first woman to wear a hijab on the magazine’s cover.Vanity Fair in the US, meanwhile, has repeatedly come in for criticism for its Hollywood covers – Annie Leibowitz photo shoots depicting an array of A-list actors in a spread that is intended to depict the state of the movie industry. “Young Hollywood is thin, white,” ran one critical headline in response to the magazine’s 2010 cover, which did not feature a single person of colour. Recent years have seen a push for ersity, with the 2017 cover featuring mixed-heritage Irish actor Ruth Negga, Lupita Nyong’o and Janelle Monáe. The magazine’s new editor, Radhika Jones, signalled a further change of intent by putting Lena Waithe, the black (and gay) actor and writer, on the April edition.But the Guardian’s data suggests focus on changes at Vogue and Vanity Fair has obscured failings elsewhere. “The industry is still overwhelmingly homogenous,” says a senior figure from an ethnic minority background working at another UK magazine, who did not want to be named. “Obviously, the appointment of Edward at Vogue is amazing, but that doesn’t change the fact that magazines are still incredibly white and middle class.”One obvious indicator of the historic failure of the biggest glossy titles to cater for black and Asian women has been the mushrooming of magazines aimed directly at them. From long-established magazines such as Pride and Black Beauty and Hair to new black platforms such as Black Ballad, Gal-Dem, Glam Africa, and Skin Deep, and Asian titles such as Asian Woman, DesiMag and Burnt Roti, women of colour have been reaching for magazines that normalise their look and the issues facing their communities.“Growing up, I would pick up magazines, and I never saw anybody who looked like me,” says Afua Adom, former editor of Pride. “I was really into music, so I used to read Smash Hits and magazines like that I never saw a person who looked like me. And where I lived in Scotland there was no one who looked like me anywhere. My mum subscribed to Pride, and that’s why I wanted to work there all those years ago – because it was the only magazine I saw full of women who looked like me.”The mainstream magazines are little better than they used to be. “You flick through any title and there’s a page that’s got shampoos and stuff and there’s nothing for afro hair, or there are no beauty solutions for darker skins, or there’s no skincare for darker skin,” Adom says. “It’s like that all the time. And you just think: ‘The way that you’ve alienated so many women who pick up this magazine so quickly, there’s no thought process there at all.’”One of the magazines I read while growing up was Marie Claire, which remains one of the UK’s bestselling women’s monthlies. Although its content is more erse than it was, its covers did not feature a single non-white model in 2017.I tell Trish Halpin, Marie Claire’s editor in chief, of my surprise that the magazine is still failing to speak to women like me on its covers.Halpin agrees that the magazine’s record is problematic, but she says editors lack control over the timing of their cover stars. “We changed from model covers about 15, 20 years ago,” she says. “It’s now very much about that A-list star on the cover that’s going to sell the magazine on the newsstand. We start with a wishlist of essentially very recognisable stars, within a particular demographic of the age of women we are speaking to – early 20s, to late 30s, early 40s. Within that wishlist, there are definitely a good number of black women and women of colour. But it’s not that easy to get them. We are experiencing the trickle effect – there still isn’t a big enough pool. We had two black actresses lined up for 2017, but their publicist decided to go with other titles. We are hoping we are going to secure one of those for our summer covers next year.”I approached three other editors, who didn’t wish to go on the record. But other senior figures in the industry say the Guardian’s research reflects a relatively small pool of BAME A-list stars, linked to a wider inability in the film and fashion industries to recognise BAME talent. Yet over the decades magazine editors have proved their ability to shape perceptions as much as to reflect them. They are the ones who decide who is “cover-worthy”.All of the magazine industry figures I spoke to, while admitting shortcomings in cover ersity, pointed to significant change inside magazines. Halpin said that, in relation to Marie Claire, it was important to judge the magazine by its content as well.“You’ll see a very different story there,” she says. “At Marie Claire, we used 17 models of colour – which is probably about a third to a quarter of all of the models that we shoot.”The change inside magazines is one I have noticed, and one that would have gone a long way towards alleviating my own anxiety of otherness, had it been the case when I was a young magazine reader. Greater use of models of colour on inside pages reflects the progress being made across the fashion industry. The website Fashion Spot reported a rise in ersity in global fashion in 2017, with the big fashion capitals of New York, Milan, Paris and London all featuring more women of colour than in previous years.But covers matter. Those who appear on them are the ambassadors of beauty, success and commercial appeal. For those who scan magazine racks, the impression of whose faces are projected out on to a shop floor has a visceral impact – and the choices of whose faces those are reverberate, influencing others. There’s a danger, too, that ersifying the models inside magazines while the covers remain white sends a new message of hierarchical beauty standards – suggesting women of colour have their place, and it’s not on the cover.Internationally, according to the Fashion Spot, cover stars are becoming more racially erse. Six of the 10 most booked cover stars in 2017 were women of colour, such as Dutch-Egyptian-Moroccan model Imaan Hammam. Adwoa Aboah graced eight international covers Rihanna featured on seven.This makes the tendency of some editors – who have historically passed the buck elsewhere within the fashion industry – seem harder to sustain. “Black models don’t sell magazines,” Jourdan Dunn, one of the most recognisable fashion faces in the UK, was told when she inquired about the absence of other black women from a high-end fashion magazine in 2013. Yet their current popularity on the catwalk suggests that they could.The magazine industry’s reluctance to put BAME women on its covers is not the only way it is failing the public. The situation is even worse regarding larger, older and transgender models. But there are numerous firsthand accounts of the way in which representation of race has a particularly negative effect on black women.Nyong’o, for example, has spoken candidly about the impact black supermodel Alek Wek had on her shortly before she won her first Oscar. “She was dark as night, she was on all of the runways and in every magazine, and everyone was talking about how beautiful she was,” Nyong’o has said. “My complexion had always been an obstacle to overcome … When I saw Alek … I had a spring in my step because I felt more seen, more appreciated by the far away gatekeepers of beauty.” Nyong’o – and the other members of the tiny group of women of colour who do feature on magazine covers – are still overcoming these obstacles. In 2017, two magazines – the Evening Standard magazine and Grazia – infuriated black women in particular when they airbrushed out the more visible elements of black hairstyles from cover models’ looks. “I remember the Lupita Nyong’o cover where Grazia just airbrushed her afro out,” says Adom. “I was so disappointed, because I really love that title – I buy it all the time. And they took such a long a long time to apologise … I just thought: ‘You guys just don’t get it.’”As the country becomes increasingly erse – more than a quarter of schoolchildren in England are from ethnic minority groups – it is of special concern that this is not being reflected in magazine covers. Corinna Shaffer, editorial director of Immediate Media, which publishes 21 children’s magazine titles, including all but one of those featured in the Guardian study, acknowledges more needs to be done.It’s interesting that Shaffer mentions tokenism. Across the industry, there’s a concern that crude attempts to remedy a lack of ersity in magazine covers will do more harm than good.“I have sat in meetings at some publications where someone has said, ‘Oh, we haven’t got a black person in the May edition – we need to figure that out,’” says one source at a women’s magazine. “When I hear that, it tells me you are not getting it right – that is just tokenistic. We need to talk about the underlying reasons why black women are not finding themselves on the covers, as they undeniably should, through the normal process.”“You don’t have to have a erse team to have erse magazine covers, but when you do, ersity is a natural outflow of that. You have people who have different points of view and opinion – a more well-rounded mix,” the source adds. “We are not even getting people from a erse range of backgrounds applying for positions at a senior level.”The failure of magazines to recruit from a wide pool of journalists – particularly in erse cities such as London – creates a vicious cycle in which unreflective newsrooms continue to produce unreflective editorial and cover content, further alienating readers from different backgrounds.“The erasure of black and brown people from magazine covers is part of a much broader process of “othering” – it reinforces the idea that people of colour are not the norm,” says writer and critic Maya Goodfellow. “What should concern us all is the multifaceted impact this has on notions of race in the UK and the idea it creates that people of colour don’t belong.”It is also bad business. In these challenging economic times, neither publishers nor the advertisers on whom they rely can afford to turn away ethnic minority women who, figures show, spend a disproportionate amount on beauty and cosmetic products.If my teenage experience is anything to go by, the images magazines choose to place on their covers are incredibly influential, not just reflecting trends and celebrity in other industries, but setting them. When it comes to representation of people of colour, it is a responsibility, and an opportunity, that they could do much more to harness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbf9a28707fb4906f117ddb835e2f15cb952960f/0_238_2170_1302/master/2170.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4a1972be405d61bb310fda7a23f1ea7e 1240w","title":"10 years of lady gaga how she queered mainstream pop forever","story":"It’s a decade since Lady Gaga burst into the charts with Just Dance, and showed a new generation how to create a vivid identity for yourself, anywhereThe year is 2008. I sit on the floor of my family’s modest living room in a sleepy suburb in Ireland, my tongue contorting around my teeth in concentration as I apply a finishing layer of glitter to my masterpiece. It is my 14th year of life and also the 14th time in an hour that I’ve hit the replay button on my big sister’s CD player. A mere month before this scene, Lady Gaga had exploded out of obscurity – it is her image my younger self is reproducing in card and glitter, while Just Dance, released 10 years ago this week, loops in the background. In this moment, I already know that whatever is represented by this woman, this symbol, I love wholeheartedly. I know that she is the living embodiment of some ideal type that informs who I am. What I don’t yet know is that who I am is gay – and that my gayness will become inextricably intertwined over the course of my life with Gaga. She will become the background music in every gay club I will dance in, the overture to every drunken kiss, a talking point for every first date.Female pop icons have long formed a core part of gay culture, and much has been written about why. Some say we live vicariously through their sexuality more Freudian theories suggest they’re our surrogate mothers. Less controversially, one could simply say their bright pop ballads about overcoming love and loss have historically provided a light-hearted, strobe-lit, glittery escapism from a world darkened by the shadows of HIV and homophobia. Before Gaga there was Madonna, Cher, Diana Ross. You may think Gaga didn’t do anything over and above what these performers did: provide glamour and camp value. But the special place she carved in the hearts of gay people cannot be reduced to her penchant for changing wigs – Lady Gaga queered the mainstream.She emerged into a pop landscape staggeringly different to the one we inhabit in 2018. The pre-Gaga charts of 2007 were socially and politically sterile, thronged with such hetero banalities as Kaiser Chiefs and Timbaland. The closest we got to queer representation was the tasteless gay-baiting of Katy Perry’s I Kissed a Girl in 2008. We were at the zenith of an economic boom, unaware of the impending global economic catastrophe that would spark a period of political revolution to coincide with Gaga’s rise. Economic comfort meant that oppression was felt less keenly, that discourse was relaxed. For kids like me stagnating in small towns, in countries where gay marriage was still illegal and casual homophobia rife, the silence felt like the calm before the storm.Some would have disregarded the reactionary content of noughties charts and simply looked back to David Bowie, Prince and Boy George for revolutionary queer role models instead – they destabilised gender categories a decade before Gaga was born. But to my generation, these icons and their reassuring androgyny were out of reach. My childhood was an alienating cultural wasteland, where I survived on a diet of my parents’ Irish country music and my peers’ Top 40 pop. This was still the age of dial-up modems – for many pre-smartphone era queer kids, the likes of Bowie may as well not have existed.Consequently, Lady Gaga turned my world upside down. I suffered from chronic anxiety, linked to years of bullying. I was offensively effeminate and school was an ordeal spent avoiding older boys who spat “faggot” at me in the corridors. After Gaga exploded, I fashioned my own diamond-encrusted glasses and dyed my hair green – the slurs in the corridors lost their power when, like Gaga, I was deliberately provoking the attention. “What a freak,” my peers would scream at pictures of Gaga’s meat dress. I burned with defiance to hear them deride her – if she was a freak, this person I loved, then I didn’t want to be normal any more. The word “faggot” resounding in the corridor no longer marked me out as lesser, but placed me on a pedestal alongside my heroine, another freak – who happened to be No 1 in 20 countries. Her otherness made my own otherness feel more aspirational than painful. In a world of utter darkness, her presence was my only light, a wordless pathway to myself before I even knew what the word queer meant.Gaga did for my generation what Bowie did 20 years earlier. She re-queered a mainstream that had fallen back into heteronormative mundanity. She vocally defended the rights of LGBT people and spoke of her own bisexuality openly. In pop, she expanded what was palatable. She repopularised the flamboyant theatricality of outrageous costuming, on-stage bleeding and compulsive wig changes. She drew inspiration from Bowie’s lightning bolts, Alexander McQueen’s fashion, Leigh Bowery’s performance art, Prince’s androgyny. She performed in male drag, and forced us to question gender characteristics and human physicality with facial protrusions and prosthetic penises. She was the vanguard for a revival of queerness in pop culture that has left an astonishing legacy a decade later – one would hardly bat an eyelid now to hear a word such as “transgender” uttered in a chart-topping song, but before Born This Way the thought would have been startling. It is partly thanks to her that we now live in an era where RuPaul’s Drag Race is mainstream.In fact, Drag Race is perhaps the key to understanding what Gaga did for young queer people. When Gaga appeared as a host on the ninth series of the show, she entered posing as one of the contestants. It’s not insignificant that Gaga presented herself as a drag queen – that’s precisely what she has always been, and what she taught young queer people like me to be.Drag is about borrowing cultural references to construct a persona. When Gaga reinvented the revolutionary queer spirit of Bowie and Prince for the youth of the noughties, she was performing a drag of her own. She borrowed tropes to construct the persona that accrued her fame, figuratively lip-syncing along to the legacies of Cher, Madonna, and the stars she imitated. She invented Gaga in the same way that drag queens do their alter egos.Millions of young gay people in turn used her example to construct their own identities in small, alienating towns and villages around the world. Every person needs references to inform their social performance, to do a sort of drag in their daily lives. Gaga offered queer people those references that our heteronormative hometowns couldn’t, reaching back into the past and passing them forward to those of us who could not access them alone. She taught a new generation of young queer people how to drag up an identity out of a barrenness around them, by looking to history and pop culture. This is what gay people have always done – but many of my generation didn’t know how. Mine was a generation whose would-be mentors had been decimated by the HIV epidemic, causing a wealth of generational community knowledge to be lost forever a generation where cohesion in the real-world gay community was breaking down and gay spaces were closing.Gaga replaced my would-be mentors. When I mimicked her outrageous presentation, I was tapping into the references she offered to express a queerness that I was not yet able to put into words. Without her in the charts, many queer kids like me would have been left with no touchstones whatsoever. She taught us all to be drag queens in our own lives – as RuPaul says, “We’re all born naked, the rest is drag”. When Gaga came to host Drag Race 9, she was truly coming home. Her importance was summarised with beautiful simplicity when one of the contestants, Eureka, broke down, saying “you don’t realise what you do for people like us”.Ten years on, Gaga’s legacy is a changed world. For me, and many gay people around the globe, she is the icon of our generation, to whom we owe nothing less than our identities. Baby, there’s no other superstar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1354e6722e5d64f06234e94fc5455a27a8a842f7/0_0_6211_3727/master/6211.jpg?w=6000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1107848ad701d780d22d762227155593 12000w","title":"commonwealth uk brexit leaving eu","story":"As director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, I know what this institution does – and the notion that it can pick up the slack when the UK leaves the EU is nonsense. By  Philip Murphy‘So, Professor Murphy,” said the voice at the end of the line. “What does the Commonwealth mean to you?” It was 2014, and I had agreed to do a live interview about the Commonwealth for a radio talk show. Media interest had been sparked by the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, and while I waited, phone in hand, for my turn to speak, the presenter was busily soliciting Commonwealth-related thoughts from anyone he could find on Glasgow’s streets that morning.Finally, just as the clock was ticking towards the very end of the show, the presenter turned his attentions to me. But I was stumped by the question. What does the Commonwealth mean to me? It was only since I had become director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies (ICwS) a few years earlier that it had “meant” anything much at all. And what was that meaning? Lots of drinks receptions in the hollowed-out citadels of Britain’s former imperial power? Endless well-meaning conferences exploring how the Commonwealth could achieve its “true potential”?In the three-and-a-half seconds while all this was racing through my head, the presenter correctly anticipated that a cheery anecdote would not be forthcoming, and moved on to the more concrete question: “What does the Commonwealth actually do?” I blurted out something spectacularly feeble along the lines of: “Well, it doesn’t do very much, but then it doesn’t cost very much.” And that was it – straight into the 10 o’clock news and traffic roundup. Not my finest hour.With the Commonwealth Games taking place at the moment and the biennial Commonwealth heads of government meeting opening in London next week, my institute will again be fielding a high volume of press enquiries. And this time, I’ll be ready for the “What does it mean to you?” question. Back in 2014, I wasn’t. But it was a variant of another question that I had regularly been asked in the five years since I became director of the ICwS: “How did you become interested in the Commonwealth?” There was always an assumption that some element of my upbringing or family history must have sparked my interest in this unique organisation, one that is very largely made up of former parts of the British empire. It currently has 53 members, including Britain itself, which range in size from India, with a population of more than 1.3 billion people, to the tiny Pacific island states of Tuvalu and Nauru, with populations of about 11,000 and 13,000 respectively. But there was nothing I could really point to. I grew up in Hull. Very occasionally we did go overseas on family holidays – but only to the Isle of Man. I can’t remember anyone even mentioning Commonwealth Day while I was at school in the 1970s and 80s. Had they been fee-paying public schools, where a good smattering of the families would probably have had records of imperial service, the situation might have been different. But they most decidedly were not.Later, as a postgraduate student studying how the Conservative party reacted to the decolonisation of Africa, I became familiar with the idea of the Commonwealth as a great, soothing comfort blanket for the party’s dwindling band of post-second world war imperial enthusiasts. They could reassure themselves that the sad business of granting independence to British colonies wasn’t really the end of the line. Like the souls of the faithful departed, these countries would simply join the heavenly throng of the Commonwealth and live in eternal peace and harmony.For the next 20 years or so, insofar as I thought about the Commonwealth, it was largely as a relatively minor aspect of British foreign policy. During the postwar period, the organisation had moved from being seen as an essential prop of Britain’s “great power” status to representing a puzzle, then an irritant, and finally a constant source of disappointment. It has maintained a loyal band of supporters, mostly concentrated in a series of London-based affiliated organisations. Yet even they often seem unable to provide any very convincing reasons for their enthusiasm.Suddenly, people started to talk about the Commonwealth again. The trouble was that most of what they were saying was nonsense.In the weeks after Britain voted for Brexit, as I tried to come to terms with what seemed to me an unmitigated disaster, there were always sympathetic friends on hand to make matters worse. “You’re at the centre of things now,” they said. “You must be very busy. Apparently the Commonwealth is the way of the future.” To which, as the director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, my response was: “If the Commonwealth is the future, then we’re in even more trouble than I thought.”Despite the leave campaign’s best efforts to turn the Commonwealth into a symbol of Britain’s ability to stand on the international stage independently of the EU, its power and influence has long been on the wane. Just a year before the Brexit referendum, the party manifestos for the UK general election reflected the Commonwealth’s diminished importance. In place of Labour’s 1997 vow to give renewed priority to this “unique network of contacts linked by history, language and legal systems”, the party now barely mentioned it. The Conservatives were a little more forthcoming, although they largely cut and pasted the words from their 2010 document. Ukip, predictably, scattered in references far more frequently than anyone else. Yet even they had dropped a startlingly ambitious proposal that had featured in its 2010 manifesto, to establish “a Commonwealth Free Trade Area” with the other Commonwealth countries.So, how exactly did it manage to shuffle its way back into the political conversation? For the leave campaign, depicting the Commonwealth as a huge potential trading opportunity for the UK was a useful fiction. This was reassuring mood music for a campaign keen to demonstrate that Britain would not be left helpless and isolated after Brexit. Yet beyond a few hand-me-down figures about its supposed economic potential, there were few clues about how or why the volume of trade with Commonwealth member states would be increased.Although the Commonwealth featured as an element in the snake oil sold to voters by the leave campaign, it was by no means the most potent ingredient. Indeed, many Brexiters struggled with the whole concept of the Commonwealth. On the one hand, it fed into their arguments that Britain had the opportunity to engage more actively with growing economies outside the EU. But it also sat uneasily within a campaign that had focused sharply on the issue of immigration.Once the result was announced, some of Britain’s most prominent Commonwealth enthusiasts began celebrating. Less than a week after the vote, the Daily Telegraph carried an article by David Howell, then chairman of the Royal Commonwealth Society, under the headline “A bright future awaits Britain post-Brexit in the Commonwealth markets”. It rehearsed a series of arguments that had been regularly trotted out for two decades, including the idea of a “Commonwealth advantage” in terms of the ease and cost of trade, and the notion that the world’s future growth areas would be outside the EU: “It is to Asia, Africa and Latin America we need to look for the big prizes, and the Commonwealth network is the gateway to many of these fast-growing new economies,” Lord Howell wrote.Given the ever more certain prospect that we will, indeed, leave the EU, it is worth looking closely at whether there is anything to this view. The origins of Howell’s argument go back to a brief and not very well-substantiated 1994 article by the Australian scholar Katherine West, titled “Britain, the Commonwealth and the Global Economy”, which was published in the the Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs. The piece began with the proposition that, for the UK, Europe had “become an economic black spot, with double-digit unemployment and the lowest rates of growth in the developed world”. It suggested that the British government’s “Eurocentric political rhetoric” tended to disguise the importance to Britain of markets outside the EU. West then moved to note “the spectacular economic growth” of Asian markets, suggesting again that “myopic concentration” on Europe on the part of British policymakers was an impediment to the exploitation of these markets.Tony Blair’s New Labour government, which took office in May 1997, initially seemed keen to run with this idea. The UK was about to host a Commonwealth heads of government meeting for the first time in 20 years, and the idea of the Commonwealth as an instrument to promote British trade seemed a useful way of fitting this rather creaking institution into New Labour’s modernising agenda.This new commercially minded love affair between the Blair government and the Commonwealth was, however, fairly shortlived. In the short term, Blair himself seemed disillusioned from virtually his first sight of the Commonwealth in action, irritated by the drawn-out and inconclusive nature of the Edinburgh Commonwealth heads of government meeting. In the longer term, and particularly after 911, Blair’s attentions focused on Anglo-American relations and the Middle East.Nevertheless, it was clear that promoting the notion of the Commonwealth as an under-utilised business asset was a way of persuading the British government to take it seriously. During the next two decades, bodies such as the Royal Commonwealth Society, the Commonwealth Business Council and the Commonwealth Secretariat pushed the idea vigorously. In particular, they suggested that there was a “Commonwealth effect” that rendered intra-Commonwealth trade cheaper and easier – an idea that can be traced directly to West’s 1994 article.These figures are now regularly rehearsed at Commonwealth gatherings, but there has been little objective analysis of this report, and we might well be cautious in reading too much into them. First, as the study notes, there are wide variations in the extent to which inidual Commonwealth countries trade with others. For some, the proportion is relatively low. The UK and Canada are mentioned in this context as countries “positioned close to large non-Commonwealth markets”. By contrast, there are other member states, including Singapore and Malaysia, that enjoy greater geographical proximity to major Commonwealth trading partners, and so conduct a much higher proportion of intra-Commonwealth trade. Given this, and the fact that there are huge variations in the levels of trade conducted by inidual member states, it is difficult to see what we can actually learn from an average figure for “Commonwealth advantage” between two notional Commonwealth states.It is worth noting, too, that in the run-up to the referendum, Commonwealth member states were virtually as one in wishing Britain to remain part of the EU. Behind this uncharacteristic outbreak of unanimity is the simple fact that Brexit throws the UK’s future trading relationships into confusion. The working assumption is that the current EU agreements, which allow many developing Commonwealth countries access to the UK market on advantageous terms, will lapse in Britain at the moment that Brexit takes effect. It will only be after that point that the UK has the legal capacity to negotiate trade agreements independently of the EU.This means many less-developed Commonwealth countries that currently conduct a significant proportion of their trade with the UK risk being hit by an immediate tariff hike. Given the finite resources available to the UK government for complex trade negotiations, and that attention is likely to be focused on the more lucrative markets of Europe, Asia and North America, Commonwealth countries quite reasonably fear that they will be a relatively low priority for Brexit Britain. The UK is also a major contributor to the EU aid budget, from which many Commonwealth countries benefit, and British overseas dependencies face the prospect of losing access to this important source of development funding altogether.In October 2010, Michael Ancram – then the former Conservative shadow foreign secretary – published a pamphlet setting out a new agenda for British foreign policy. The document, titled Farewell to Drift: A New Foreign Policy for a Network World, showed the influence of David Howell’s worldview: the forces of globalisation were steadily undermining the significance of old-fashioned power blocs such as the EU. Conversely, the Commonwealth, with its lack of treaty or constitution and its emphasis on collaboration and mutual support, was “a readymade vehicle for positive action”.“For too long the Commonwealth has been under-funded and underappreciated by many of its members, including the UK,” Ancram wrote. “For us it costs only 20p per person per year, while the EU costs £52 per person per year. It urgently needs, with British help, encouragement and involvement to become a bolder organisation that recognises its own strengths. It could have associate members as well as new members indeed some of the giants of the world like Japan could become interested, especially if it is based in the emerging powerhouse of India. It is in our interest to encourage such countries to become involved in the Commonwealth in one way or another.”During the 2016 referendum campaign, Ancram duly pinned his colours firmly to the leave mast. His encomium nicely encapsulated many elements of the British myth of the Commonwealth. This includes the tension between wishing to use the organisation more effectively, and disavowing any wish to lead it. Ancram was not the first Commonwealth enthusiast to recommend moving its headquarters to India, the most populous member state – but, more than seven years since the publication of his pamphlet, that prospect is no less remote. With many members of India’s policymaking elite seeing the Commonwealth as little more than a quaint relic of British imperialism, there is little chance of them offering it this sort of flag of convenience. There was also something familiar in Ancram’s ambiguous contrast between the supposed 20p cost of the Commonwealth, against the EU’s £52. Were we supposed to conclude that the Commonwealth is better value for money, or simply that it is under-resourced?Commonwealth enthusiasts generally want to have it both ways: the Commonwealth has supposedly vast potential (thus the idea of Japan joining as an associate member), which could be augmented further with a little additional funding, yet membership will always remain cheaper than the EU, and not only in terms of the UK’s direct financial contribution. Somehow, this mythical Commonwealth of the future will cost less than the EU in terms of the vast number of hours required to negotiate its treaties and other formal agreements it will not require members to make significant concessions in return for some collective good and it will have only the most rudimentary of mechanisms to enforce its will.In this light, the Commonwealth is the international relations equivalent of a homeopathic remedy – a cadre of staff so small as to be almost invisible when dissolved across a body comprising 2.4 billion people, which nevertheless does or could achieve miraculous results. But the promise of the Commonwealth can be seen in another, arguably far more realistic way. It is based on the prospect offered by charlatans and quacks throughout the ages – that of something for nothing.In the decades since the second world war, the process of devising and agreeing mechanisms for European cooperation has indeed been time-consuming and expensive. But it has resulted in a series of concrete achievements, above all the creation of the world’s largest free-trading bloc. Decisions made at an EU level affect the texture of daily life in its member states in the way that the Commonwealth’s empty pronouncements do not. As a result, any contemporary survey of international relations since 1945 is likely to devote considerable space to the EU and little or none to the Commonwealth. Frankly, the EU matters, in a way that the Commonwealth does not.This has long been apparent to those within the UK government who engage directly with the Commonwealth. It is far less obvious, however, to the vast majority of people in the UK, who know the organisation largely through occasional high-profile events such as the Commonwealth Games, and through the annual round-robin delivered in the Queen’s speech. It is at this level, and in this specifically British context, that the myth of the Commonwealth is arguably most dangerous. It encourages perceptions of the organisation as some sort of genuine global network with the UK at its centre, the other members ready to fall into line and embrace the prodigal mother whenever Britain finally decides that it is time to resume a guiding role.It was this combination of a widespread unfamiliarity with how the modern Commonwealth actually functions, and a lingering sense that it is in some way a special asset to the UK, that allowed some in the leave camp to present it during the 2016 referendum campaign as a direct alternative to the EU. This was despite the fact that the vast majority of Commonwealth members, and indeed the secretary general, Patricia Scotland, emphasised that membership of both organisations was not only wholly compatible but also mutually beneficial. The referendum result marked the point when the Commonwealth ceased to be simply a puzzle in Whitehall – an itch the civil service didn’t quite know how or where to scratch – and became a contributory factor in, arguably, Britain’s greatest foreign policy disaster since the end of the second world war.What, then, should be the basis of the UK’s future relationship with the Commonwealth? It could be argued that the referendum result has already ordained that this relationship will be an ever-closer one. But I doubt that. Brexit is unlikely to enhance British trade with Commonwealth countries. Indeed, in the short term, it might actually reduce it, as the UK struggles to replicate deals already in place under its EU membership. There may be closer trading and diplomatic relations with Australia and New Zealand, which represent the acceptable face of the organisation to those leave supporters who continue to regard the citizens of the notional white Commonwealth as “kith and kin”. But when it comes to the genuinely vast potential of the Indian market, a UK government driven by the anti-immigration agenda of leave voters is unlikely to make great strides in that direction. For example, India seems likely to want a relaxation of visa restrictions on its nationals in return for trade liberalisation. Certainly, the issue of immigration overshadowed Theresa May’s visit there in November 2016, leading to accusations that the UK wanted India’s business, but not its people. And whatever the future holds, invoking the name of the Commonwealth is unlikely to oil the wheels of any trade deal.As the Commonwealth summit in London approaches, get ready to hear about the long list of good causes – from ending war and poverty to tackling climate change, and from spreading democracy to promoting gender equality – that the organisation champions. All of this is, indeed, laudable. But given the Commonwealth’s record in recent years, one would need a great deal of faith and a remarkably short memory to believe that the organisation really can make a significant contribution in any of these areas. What is surely beyond doubt is that the Commonwealth cannot rescue the UK from the grievous, self-inflicted wound of Brexit. And any suggestion that it can will only serve to rob the organisation of whatever last vestiges of credibility it still possesses.Adapted from The Empire’s New Clothes: The Myth of the Commonwealth by Philip Murphy, published by Hurst on 19 April• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d92c36f21038fc0b95617acc7466e8538fa46ac9/376_0_4699_2987/master/4699.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0116846df86a3dd2d829252492b7d25 1010w","title":"mays frictionless eu trade plan after brexit dealt blow by key ally","story":"More bureaucracy will be part of price tag for UK leaving single market, says Danish PMTheresa May’s plans for a Brexit deal that delivers frictionless trade with the EU have been dealt a blow by a key European ally who has said there will be more bureaucracy after leaving the bloc.The Danish prime minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said after talks with his UK counterpart in Copenhagen that there would be an inevitable price to pay for Britain leaving the single market.Following a bilateral meeting with May, he told reporters at a joint press conference: “We should avoid too many changes in our relations and I am totally in favour of an enhanced trade agreement between the EU and UK.The UK could sign up to all the EU’s rules and regulations, staying in the single market – which provides free movement of goods, services and people – and the customs union, in which EU members agree tariffs on external states. Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to “take back control” of laws, borders and money\u0026nbspwould not have been fulfilled. This\u0026nbspis an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels – but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A “Norway-minus” deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to erge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other “non-tariff barriers” to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May’s direction so far.Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business – a very different future and a lot of disruption.“I hope if there’s willingness … we will close a deal which will be as close to what we know now as possible. But we have to be realistic and we have to realise that there will be changes. Leaving the single market comes with a price tag and unfortunately the price tag is also a Danish price tag. “That is the reality of life. There will be more bureaucracy in future, unfortunately.”The European council president, Donald Tusk, has already told the UK that it should not expect frictionless trade outside the single market. “Friction is an inevitable side-effect of Brexit,” he said in March. Rasmussen, whose country is generally regarded as sympathetic toward the UK having also joined the EU in 1973, insisted Brussels was simply aiming to be “realistic and fair” in the negotiations. May also signalled that the government’s goal of cutting net annual immigration to below 100,000 would remain in place after Brexit. She said: “We recognise the concern that people in the UK have about this issue of net migration into the UK, which is why we set ourselves the target … and want to continue to work to ensure that we address that particular target.”Her position was in stark contrast to that of her home secretary, Amber Rudd, who repeatedly refused to confirm to the Commons home affairs committee last month that she was aiming to meet the target by the next election. The two leaders also discussed fishing rights, and May promised that Denmark, whose boats regularly fish in British waters, would get “fair and reciprocal access” after Brexit.Britain is braced for tough negotiations with Brussels after delaying the decision over who will control and have access to its territorial waters. The government is also facing calls at home from an increasingly belligerent fishing industry to restrict the number of foreign boats. May, who backed remaining in the EU, again refused to say whether she had changed her mind about Brexit when challenged by a Danish journalist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f398dba007c72a0235adea0e190a983ee8375024/0_128_5125_3077/master/5125.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d700f25e253cfa4d04de12d235eb580c 1240w","title":"labour minister barry gardiner sorry good friday agreement shibboleth","story":"Recording of party frontbencher emerges hours after apology for Good Friday agreement criticismBarry Gardiner, the shadow trade secretary and Jeremy Corbyn loyalist, has described Labour’s six tests on Brexit as “bollocks”, ridiculed the “meaningful vote” on the deal that Labour MPs fought for and said “any politician who tells you what’s going to happen … around that final deal is lying to you”.His remarks, caught on tape at a question and answer session after a speech in Germany last month, are the most disruptive within Labour since the general election cemented Corbyn’s position as party leader. They will be regarded by some in the shadow cabinet as a deliberate attempt to wreck Labour’s carefully negotiated position on Brexit. The recording emerged hours after Gardiner was forced to apologise for suggesting that the Good Friday agreement was outdated, a suggestion made at the same event in Germany.Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is understood to have raised Gardiner’s comments about the Good Friday agreement with Corbyn’s office, and is expected to make a second complaint on Tuesday.Starmer has repeatedly demanded that any Brexit deal achieves “the exact same benefits” as the current relationship with the European Union. It was one of six tests set a year ago, just before article 50 was triggered, setting the negotiations in progress.Gardiner was recorded ridiculing the proposal to have the same benefits – “It’s bollocks. Always has been bollocks” – and went on to dismiss the whole strategy of the six tests.“We know very well that we cannot have the exact same benefits. And actually, you know, it would have made sense, because it was the Tories that said they were going to secure the exact same benefits, and our position should have been precisely to say: ‘They have said that they will secure the exact same benefits and we are going to hold them to that standard’.” Gardiner then poured scorn on the idea of holding a “meaningful vote” in parliament on the final deal – Labour’s proudest achievement during the passage of the Brexit bill. “You tell me what a meaningful vote is? Is a meaningful vote one where you have alternatives and you reject one and you opt for the other? If so, what are the alternatives? … What we’re going to have is, at best, clarity about the orce settlement.” He suggested the most likely result would be the downfall of Theresa May, but even that would not resolve anything. “What is the new prime minister, the new leader of the Conservative party, going to be able to do as a result of that parliamentary vote? Do they go back and try to renegotiate a different deal in Europe? Well, there’s no time for that. Do they hold a general election?”Labour has not formally addressed the question of what should happen if the deal were unacceptable to the Commons. In remarks that will further infuriate his shadow cabinet colleagues, Gardiner warned: “Do not underestimate the fact that any politician who tells you what’s going to happen in SeptemberOctober around that final deal is lying to you. None of us know, none of us, because it is the biggest constitutional crisis that our country has faced in about 40 or 50 years and we simply don’t see a clear way through it at the moment. It’s going piece by piece, staggering.”A Labour party spokesperson said: “Labour has set six tests for the final Brexit deal. Those include holding the government to its own commitment to deliver the same benefits as the single market and customs union. We have been clear that if those tests are not met Labour will not back it in parliament. Barry Gardiner fully supports that position.” Gardiner’s remarks will further stoke the anger in the party that arose after the Guardian reported Gardiner’s criticism of the Good Friday agreement. As dignitaries gathered in Northern Ireland on Tuesday to mark the peace deal’s 20th anniversary, Gardiner said: “I am deeply sorry that my informal remarks in a meeting last month have led to misunderstanding.”He apologised in particular for the use of the word “shibboleth”, which he acknowledged “gave the impression that I thought the Good Friday aagreement was in any way outdated or unimportant. I absolutely do not.”Corbyn was also forced to repeat his commitment to ensuring there was no hard border. “There must be no return to a hard border between north and south, and no return to the horrors of the Troubles. All of us on both sides of the Irish Sea have a responsibility to maintain hope for the future.”Marking the anniversary, Corbyn paid tribute to the architects of the agreement, which he called “a defining moment in Irish history which allowed peace to prevail”. “It was a great achievement and I pay tribute to the work done by Tony Blair, Mo Mowlam and Paul Murphy, as well as those on all sides in Ireland, north and south, in achieving the crucial breakthrough of the peace process.”Labour insiders were furious at Gardiner’s apparent breach of the hard-won agreement that Labour policy should be to remain in a customs union with the EU, which was agreed and set out in Corbyn’s Coventry speech in February to protect the Good Friday agreement.“Barry’s remarks certainly weren’t agreed policy, and they were very unhelpful. Barry’s on the Brexit subcommittee and he was in the room when Jeremy’s Coventry speech was drafted, and that’s the policy now, ” one source said.On Tuesday morning, Gardiner restated his support for party policy. “The Good Friday agreement is a vital and essential part of the relationship between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and has been central to the two decades of peace it has brought about.“Labour is completely committed to the agreement and opposed to any return of a hard border between north and south. We are committed to negotiating a new customs union between the UK and Ireland as part of a final Brexit settlement, which would play a key role in ensuring there is no hard border.”Days after Gardiner’s remarks in March, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Smith, was sacked from Labour’s frontbench for writing an article in the Guardian that supported a second referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal. Smith described Gardiner’s remarks as “reckless and plain wrong”.“On the Good Friday agreement’s 20th anniversary, Labour should be defending and sustaining it, not joining the Tory Brexiteers in downplaying its importance and the risks of a hard border,” Smith wrote in a tweet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/026a15d1067b0350757d031ab900947b0831c4b8/0_323_4839_2903/master/4839.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1f79599ff1df2c18f4eccfc6345501b3 1240w","title":"tony blair new leadership strong progressive centre labour conservative party","story":"Ex-PM says centrism has been abandoned by Labour and Tories but denies trying to form rival partyTony Blair has called for new political leadership from the “strong progressive centre” and confirmed his institute is developing a raft of policies to encourage such leaders.The former prime minister insisted he had not given up on Labour despite his concerns of it being “in the grip of the hard left”.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he admitted he was trying re-energise the centre ground of British politics, which he claimed was being abandoned by the two main parties. “If you leave between the Brexit-dominated Tory party and a hard-left Labour party vast uncultivated centre ground, at some point someone is going to come along and cultivate it,” he said.At the weekend the Observer revealed that plans for a new centrist party had attracted £50m of investment. Blair denied trying to form a new party, saying: “I’m not advocating it or involved in such a one or certainly not running for its leadership at this or any stage.”But he said such a plan should not be derided by the established parties. “What is most sensible is for both of the main parties to realise they can pour scorn on people who are thinking of these things, but ultimately they’ve got to understand there is a constituency in this country which is socially liberal, in favour of strong methods of social justice, but also believes in a well-run enterprising economy.”Blair lamented the lack of political leadership from centrists. He said: “The really depressing thing about western politics at the moment is that the leadership of what I would call a strong progressive centre is just not there, it is lacking. “And the result of it is you have rightwing politics going into anti-immigration nationalism and leftwing politics going into sort of anti-business old form of statism, and neither are the answer to the problem of the future.”He confirmed that his Tony Blair Institute for Global Change was developing a platform for any emerging centrist politicians to utilise. “What we are is putting together is a policy platform … that anyone in politics could take if they come from the open-minded approach to the problem, which says that globalisation is essentially a good thing, not a bad thing, but its risks have to be mitigated … My institute is looking at things like housing, infrastructure, what’s the right tax and spending policy. “It is not a manifesto because it is not for a political party – it is for people whether they are in the Labour party, Conservative party, Liberal Democrats, wherever, who can see the way politics is developing in the is country and who think there must be a better set of policy ideas for the future.”He added: “I have got no infrastructure for building some political party. But what I fully own up to is trying to create the sort of centrist policies that I think can rekindle optimism about the future, since I think that these lurches to the right and to the left are basically the politics of pessimism.“Starting a new political party is incredibly difficult. I’m focused on one thing, which is what are the right ideas.”“We have got an old-fashioned Conservative party and a Labour party that’s got frankly reheated politics from the days I remember when I was a student. I don’t think either of those things answer the challenge for the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a374eb2acb82c8588e2b633808876742c3c97925/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3a76cbc4caa95ce106b60b709831abac 1240w","title":"english language british american book","story":"Many ‘American’ phrases are actually British but a new book argues why we say what we say reveals a lot about our culturesTo those dedicated warriors hunched over their keyboards or gripping tightly to their pens, ready to fire off an angry salvo about the Americanization of British English to their favorite newspaper, television channel or book publisher, linguist Lynne Murphy has a solemn warning: check a good dictionary first.Or consider her new book, The Prodigal Tongue: The Love-Hate Relationship Between American and British English, which assaults the British obsession of attacking US English with cold, hard facts. “There is a tendency in Britain to see linguistic things you don’t like as American,” Murphy told the Guardian. But Murphy, an American who moved to the UK in 2000, demonstrates repeatedly in her book that both countries’ citizens aren’t very good at knowing which words began in which country. For instance, while shambles may have been a British invention, Murphy says it was Americans who first used it to mean “a scene of disorder or devastation”. (It was, however, a British television writer who invented omnishambles).Her book delves past simply clarifying what Americans call a courgette to explain why the two Englishes aren’t more different, how prudishness changes our experiences at the doctor’s office and what makes grammar classes a political issue in one country but not the other.It is not just the British who are taken to task, Murphy challenges her birth country’s habit of fawning over silly British words (which are sometimes American, see: poppycock) or treating the people who speak those words as more intelligent and refined just because of how their voices sound. “Nowadays, pride in American English seems to have gone the same way as our pride in being a monarchy-free republic,” Murphy writes. “The American public enthusiastically consumes news about every British royal birth, wedding or death and fetishizes the u in colour as if it hadn’t deserved the drubbing our ancestors gave it.” These language explorations aren’t just about proving people wrong, Murphy insists. Knowing the stories behind our languages helps us better understand ourselves. She pointed to how people from the two countries say please and thank you at inverse rates: with the British saying please more and Americans saying thank you more. “That tells us a story about British politeness culture being more deferent to saying please and American politeness culture being more interested in not showing deference but showing appreciation,” Murphy said. “Because we do tend to assume ‘the way I say things are just the way things get said’, but we say things for particular reasons and you learn a lot about yourself that way.”Before arriving in the UK, Murphy had worked in South Africa and was already well-versed in the familiar differences between Englishes, such as liftelevator and biscuitcookie. It was the lesser-known linguistic differences, such as how Americans think a frown is something you do with your mouth and the British think is something you do with your eyebrows, that inspired her in 2006 to start a blog: Separated by a Common Language. Blog entries, like the book, explore things such as the differences between American and British overstatement and why one country says arse and the other says ass. And though Murphy is married to a Londoner and has lived in the UK for nearly 20 years, she has yet to identify all the linguistic differences between the two languages. The University of Sussex linguistics professor said she still leaves administrative meetings at work with notes on phrasings unusual to her American-born ears, such as “not worth the candle”, which means worthless. “I learn new things all the time,” she said.Lynne Murphy’s The Prodigal Tongue: The Love-Hate Relationship Between American and British English is published by Penguin Books in the US and Oneworld in the UKThese words came into English after 1776. Do you know whether they are American, British or neither?

Money talks in Augusta, same as anywhere, but Augusta does not like to talk money. Certainly they are made in Cincinnati by the Hamilton Tailoring Co, from tropical wool, pantone 342, three buttons, double‑breasted, with the owner’s name stitched on the inside. And there is nothing, certainly not in the game of golf, that Rory McIlroy wants more. This was McIlroy’s fourth run at finishing the career grand slam and the most painful to watch of the lot because it was his best chance yet.McIlroy was right where he wanted to be on Sunday, in the final group, and, though he was three shots off Patrick Reed at the start, that at least meant he could freewheel as he did not have a lead to hang on to. “I’ve been waiting for this chance,” he said on Saturday night, and a long time, too. This was his first time in the final pair since 2011, when he blew up on the 10th. “That was a huge turning point in my career. It was the day that I realised I wasn’t ready to win major championships and I needed to reflect on that and realise what I needed to do differently.”That round haunted McIlroy. And, if there is a lesson there for him to use this time, it is that he has to make sure this one does not do so, too. They say the Masters starts on the back nine on Sunday but McIlroy was so flat that this one was all over by then. Jordan Spieth was so far back that even his final-round 64 did not really worry Reed. “When he birdied the 12th and 13th, I knew I had those holes coming up,” Reed said of Spieth, “and as long as I could keep it at least tied with him, he would run out of holes and I would have more birdie opportunities coming in.”So Reed felt he always had Spieth covered. It was the same with Rickie Fowler when he made a birdie on the 18th to go to 14 under. Reed knew all he had to do was get through the last two holes in even par. Which is not to say it was easy. He still had to get up and down on the 17th and then face that wicked downhill putt on the 18th green. “But I kept reminding myself, and my caddie kept reminding me: ‘Just go do you. Go play golf.’ And I was able to get through it mentally.” Reed found a way to cope.McIlroy did not. It was telling that he did not even figure in Reed’s conversation about what was going through his mind as he came round the back nine. Their business was already settled. It had been a scrap on the early holes. Both were nervous on the 1st, where Reed hit his opening tee-shot into a tree, and McIlroy pushed his wide right into the pine straw. They both ended up in the front left bunker by the green. McIlroy made much the better recovery and Reed dropped a shot. And when McIlroy uncorked a pinpoint approach on the 2nd, he looked the likely winner.Then McIlroy missed his eagle putt. Which is the first of a few what-ifs he will be left with. But still he made his birdie, which meant the gap between them was down to one and the pressure was all on Reed, just as McIlroy predicted it would be on Saturday night. But at the 3rd everything shifted when McIlroy missed a 10ft putt for par and Reed made one for birdie from half as far again. McIlroy made another birdie on the 4th but gave it away again when he missed a 5ft putt for par on the 5th. That was the end of it.“Every time I took a step forward I took a step back on the next hole,” McIlroy said. He added that he was going to “sit down and reflect over the next few days” to try to figure out what had gone wrong, “whether it be mindset or, I don’t know, if I just didn’t quite have it today”.But Reed had a pretty clear idea of what happened. The pressure got to him. “That’s the biggest thing is going into a Sunday, especially for me trying to win my first and for him, trying to win the career grand slam. It’s who is going to handle the pressure and who is going to have more pressure on them.”Reed believes that the reason McIlroy’s golf was so much worse than it had been on Saturday, when he shot 65, was because he was that much closer to winning that Green Jacket and finishing the grand slam. Hell, McIlroy could not even bring himself to say the phrase on Saturday night. “We’ll obviously still be feeling it,” he said when he was asked about the pressure, “It’s the last round of a major championship, and we’re both going for – Patrick is going for his first and I’m going for” – there was a beat here while he held the words in his throat – “something else.”McIlroy did not sound like a man who was all that comfortable with the position he was in, even though he has clearly learned to feel comfortable with the course.

She did a nice piece of work towards the end of last week and everything has gone smoothly with her.“She has plenty of form on heavy ground, but she has a good action and I think better ground wouldn’t be too much of an issue either.”As well as Walsh aiming to be the first female to ride the winner, the mare is trained by her husband, Ross O’Sullivan.“We’re counting down the days now, but it’s going to be a great experience and I’m looking forward to riding in the race again and especially for Ross.“There is so much luck involved in a Grand National. It can depend on where you’ve been positioned throughout the race or whether you’re behind a horse who doesn’t jump well. There are a lot of variables involved.“Every runner has a chance of winning the Grand National – you just do not know what is going to happen. We’re really excited about Baie Des Iles and it will be great to be a part of the race again – I’m really looking forward to it. ”There are three female jockeys lined up to ride in this year’s National with Rachael Blackamore, one of a handful of women professional riders in Ireland, booked for Alpha Des Obeaux and Bryony Frost on board Milansbar.Overnight rain has accounted for two of Tuesday’s four scheduled meetings this morning, with Southwell forced to abandon its seven-race National Hunt card following a 7am inspection and Hexham following suit a few minutes ago with its track waterlogged and more rain expected. That leaves Hereford’s jumps card as the only survivor this afternoon – and if you were planning to attend Nottingham’s first Flat meeting of the new turf campaign on Wednesday, you can forget about that as well.The obvious temptation is to spend a little more time looking at Saturday’s Grand National, but there are a couple of runners worth a second look at Hereford, including Surtee Du Berlais (3.10) in what promises to be a demanding handicap hurdle for stayers.Oliver Sherwood’s mare has not run over hurdles since February 2017, but had enough talent over timber to win a Listed event at Kempton in November 2016 and earn a handicap mark of 138. Surtee Du Berlais returns to the smaller obstacles on Tuesday off 132 following a somewhat underwhelming campaign over fences, but she is a live runner at around 7-1 if she can rediscover anything close to her best hurdling form.Llantara (2.10) produced a career-best to win by 15 lengths at Towcester 12 days ago and while a couple of those that were fancied to run well were left floundering on the ground, the winner’s time was solid. She should follow up today, while Faadhel (6.45) can make the most of an opening mark of 70 on the Flat card at Wolverhampton this evening.Tips by Greg Wood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ee4e78120b90f00c445606983041832832b6918/203_243_3005_1803/master/3005.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=785b4979e52a5b3573a669487f6b660f 6000w","title":"commonwealth games day six in pictures","story":"All the latest pictures from the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast as cyclists, boxers, ers and athletes battle for medals"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a51ba261ffb18cd47f01b76efc6f0783441ae58a/511_465_5135_3081/master/5135.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7c72c93cc11f7f3cf4965139f2f4b3bd 1240w","title":"mark bonnar i do a good cold hard stare line of duty interview","story":"After playing corrupt cops and tortured barristers in TV shows like Line of Duty and Unforgotten, Bonnar is returning to the theatre – in a dystopian drama about replacing a dead childMark Bonnar takes comfort in the fact that he once played the back end of a pantomime cow. It was the actor’s first stage role, at the amateur Leith theatre in Edinburgh, the city where he was born. It was a funny start for a man who would go on to be known for the icy stare of his green-grey eyes.Back in 2008, he was in Michael Grandage’s Twelfth Night at Wyndham’s theatre, and on press night, he started to feel a serious case of nerves. “I knew Branagh was in the audience, and Judi … I was Orsino, so I opened the show with ‘if music be the food of love, play on.’” He starts to thump his chest. “My heart was giving it that,” he says, “and then I remembered about the pantomime cow. I thought, it’s all right, isn’t it?” He laughs. “It’s not a big deal, look …” If you can be the back end of a cow … “you can do anything”.I meet Bonnar over hasty supermarket sandwiches in his lunch break. He’s much more twinkly in the flesh than his famous TV baddies and bastards, from Line of Duty to Apple Tree Yard, would suggest. But he’s also adept at comedy, playing the acerbic and pathologically dry Chris in Catastrophe, as well as popping up in Psychoville and the rebooted Porridge. We’re at a rehearsal space in south London, where he’s finishing preparations for a new play at the Royal Court, Thomas Eccleshare’s Instructions for Correct Assembly. “It’s ostensibly about a man and a woman” – played by Jane Horrocks – “who have lost their son to a heroin overdose when he was 21,” he explains. “So they buy a new one, a flatpack son. A son they can construct. It’s about love and our relationship with technology, I suppose, and about parenting, and loss, obviously. All the big questions.”Almost immediately, he was cast as the philandering Duncan in BBC1’s Scottish take on scandi-noir, Shetland, a role that’s about to take him into its fifth series. “It’s a lovely thing to do,” he says. “And there were a few bits and bobs along the way, but Line of Duty was certainly a big break, if you like. It was the biggest part I’d played on telly, with the biggest profile.”Since then, he’s been on a roll, jumping from one quality TV show to the next, most recently in the grimly gripping Unforgotten, where he was a gay barrister who had been sexually abused as a child. He puts some of his success down to luck, or, as he puts it, “a chaotic miasma of circumstance that brings you to somebody’s door”. For example, when he played Eric Morecambe in BBC4’s Eric, Ernie and Me, he was lucky that his wife, the actor Lucy Gaskell, was from Wigan, and could help him with his north-west accent. “But it also helped when I woke up the morning of the audition saying, ‘I’m not going to do it. I can’t, it’s not me, I’m not right.’ She was going, ‘Don’t be stupid, get out of the door and go.’” He thinks it’s probably easier to be married to another actor, though he’s never been married to anyone else, he points out. “It’s a weird one, isn’t it, because sometimes you have to look deep into somebody’s eyes and tell them you love them and do it every night, or for millions of people to see on the telly. So yeah, I suppose it’s a bigger leap for those who don’t do it themselves, to imagine what the fuck you’re doing.” He laughs. “You have a shorthand: ‘God, I had to get my pants off today, it was really embarrassing.’ That’s all it would take, rather than, ‘You had to do what? Why? In front of how many people? 16?’”It was the simple fact that he loved Correct Assembly so much that brought Bonnar back to the stage, even though his TV career continues to go from strength to strength. While he acts in a dystopian play about rebuilding one’s dead child, he will appear on Channel 4 in another near-future role, the third series of Humans. He plays a government scientist – other details are secret, including whether he’s a goodie or a baddie. “I don’t know if I should tell you that. And anyway, I think it’s more complicated. He’s neither one nor t’other. But both, maybe,” he teases.Why does he think audiences are so fascinated with the future right now? “I was in my 20s in the 90s, when mobile phones were first around,” he says. “That wasn’t that long ago. It feels like the rate at which it is evolving is far outstripping the rate at which we are.” He mentions fake news, Trump and the Cambridge Analytica revelations. “That kind of thing is exactly why we should be questioning our relationship with technology and truth and memory, and all the exciting things that this play brings up, albeit in a very domestic setting. That’s why things like Black Mirror are such a huge hit, because people are, rightly, terrified about what this all means.” He left Facebook himself a year ago, he says, and hasn’t missed it.Bonnar will turn 50 in November. “It gets weirder, the older you get. You look in the mirror,” he says, with a dramatic sigh, “and go, Jesus Christ, it’s all going so fast. I certainly don’t feel 50.” It’s also his mum and dad’s 50th wedding anniversary this year, and their 70th birthdays, so they’re thinking about getting together for one massive party. “My dad went to art school when I was one. They scraped and continued scraping, because artists, as we all know, don’t earn a lot of money. It’s a precarious existence and my mum didn’t work, so dad sold paintings. He was town artist for a couple of places, in the glorious 70s, when a thing like that even existed. A town artist, wow.” There’s a knock on the door, and Bonnar’s lunch break is up. This is the last day before they move into the theatre, and time is tight. Before he goes, I ask if he ever takes offence at being known as such a good villain. “No, I don’t think so,” he grins. “I relish it in a way, because you get to do things you would never obviously do. It’s more interesting to e into those kinds of psyches.” And, he says, he’s got a good thousand-yard stare. “I do a good cold, hard stare,” he nods. Go on then. And he turns to me, and stares, and it’s so unnerving that I begin to squirm. “Yeah?” he says, refusing to drop it, for just a second too long. And then he starts to laugh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f7bac99d179fde44e38591c19c2a4578375c353/0_160_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=efcc8041ab4ca2fb3de640f51e99fa07 1240w","title":"rsc royal shakespeare company costume auction ebay","story":"Outfits worn by Susannah York, Patrick Stewart and Sinéad Cusack will also be listed on eBay to raise money for the Royal Shakespeare Company’s costume workshopA red floor-length coat sported by Ian McKellen as King Lear, khaki shorts worn by Patrick Stewart as Antony and David Tennant’s Hamlet trousers are among 54 costume items to be auctioned off by the Royal Shakespeare Company this month.The eBay auction is being held to raise money for the RSC’s Stitch in Time campaign, which supports the restoration and redevelopment of its costume workshop.

Visier said the companies represent a wide array of industries.“Given managers on average earn two times the salaries of non-managers, this gap contributes significantly to the overall gender wage gap,” the report said. The report recommended companies examines their female headcount, hiring practices, performance ratings and promotion practices to help close the gap.Since the 1960s, the pay gap has narrowed in the US, but progress in the last couple of decades has slowed.

But Gelderland council has promised to monitor the impact on the local wildlife, which includes many water birds and beavers.Towns across the Netherlands have been investing in heating stretches of cycle paths, but nothing on the scale proposed in Gelderland has been constructed.Cutting through the Jufferswaard, a nature reserve near the Nederrijn in Renkum, the two-way cycle path is also likely to be one of the most idyllic, and is due to be completed in time for the winter of 2019. De Jufferswaard, a nature area of 31 hectares (77 acres), is located in the floodplain along the Nederrijn river, between the factory site of the paper mill Parenco, one of the area’s biggest employers, and the Rhine bridge at Heteren village, 7.5 miles (12km) south-west of Arnhem.Petra Borsboom, a spokesperson for Gelderland council, said they believed the path would be the longest of its type in western Europe. “We don’t want to make the claim that it is the longest in the world because there might be one in China we don’t know about,” he said.The cycle route will shorten the riding distance between Wageningen and Arnhem by 600 metres. The biggest gain of the route would be “time, safety and experience”, the council said.The spokesperson added: “This path is mainly for commuters. It is a beautiful protected area and that is the reason we wanted to do this. We don’t want to use salt there to keep it snow-free.“There was a lot of fear that frogs in the road would want to stay there but we will follow the impact on the smaller animals very closely.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f29e237198369ca27e016f09700828b2ad8d06ba/0_15_1486_891/master/1486.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=44fb2a22fd7e97914db6a39c52118f65 1240w","title":"it took me years to accept it would work readers on the good friday agreement","story":"For the 20th anniversary of the agreement we asked people to share their memories from the time and to tell us how they feel nowAlthough I was only seven at the time, I have a vivid memory of it being one of the first times when I took an interest in watching news as opposed to wanting to play outside. My mother sat down with me and proclaimed that it was the most important decision that would bring about peace for my generation and that for once we would all be equal. I remember watching both our local and the national TV coverage as I was so engrossed in the story of people putting aside differences and working towards peace. The peace process is a shining example of the good that politics and democracy can bring. It makes me proud to say that I’m from Northern Ireland due to its legacy and how that can inspire other nations also experiencing internal conflicts.Brexit poses a grave risk to the positives of the Good Friday agreement. Although I grew up in a RepublicanNationalist household I would have self-identified as a Unionist, as I felt Northern Ireland was better off as part of the UK and the EU. After the EU referendum results, my ideological views completely shifted and I wanted a united Ireland instead. I travel on the Enterprise train from Belfast to Dublin. Will a hard border force us to stop for a customs search? My boyfriend lives in Dublin and the thought that there will be added unnecessary delays when we come to be together feels so foreign and illogical to comprehend. To disregard the Good Friday agreement and its importance is to disregard the unique and special relationship Northern Ireland has with the Republic of Ireland. In doing so, Brexit risks not only the agreement but also the very nature of the United Kingdom.I grew up in suburban Dublin and my parents were from border areas (one north, one south). We visited my grandparents north of the border on a regular basis and spent a lot of time with my cousins, aunts and uncles there. It didn’t matter to me that helicopters flew overhead every day or that there were armed soldiers patrolling the streets of the quiet countryside town.  In 1992 I turned seven. My sister and I were staying with our grandparents for a few days and I was let out on my bike as long as I didn’t cross any roads. Around one corner there was a soldier holding a rifle. I was probably only a few metres past him when a huge bang went off. I was terrified and raced down the road and hit straight into my grandparents’ door. I found out later that the soldier was shot by a sniper.  Six years later and with the Good Friday agreement the lookout towers started to be dismantled and there were barely any street patrols. People were happier and free to come and go as they pleased, play sports, walk the hills and enjoy the magnificent countryside. Life was better. It got rid of the bad from both sides and I want neither to return, nor do I want anybody to relive what I’ve experienced - but I want them to remember.On the day of the agreement I remember my parents watching in the afternoon on the small TV in the living room and telling me to watch it as it was history in the making. I wasn’t really that interested though. It was lovely and sunny and the first day of the Easter holidays so I took my younger sister up to a building site to explore instead! In the run up to the election however I was engrossed. I asked my father why all these yes and no signs were up everywhere and he explained the terms of the agreement. I read the booklet and remember saying quite clearly that I would vote yes.I’m very disappointed in the current state of affairs in Northern Ireland. The political parties seem more concerned about getting one over each other rather than focusing on changing issues that affect us all, such as the economy. I really hope Brexit has as little effect as possible as a hard border would be a nightmare situation. If the UK economy slows as a result Northern Ireland will be hit the worst.My employers in Dublin gave me the day off to travel north to vote. I cried for most of the journey as I remembered the last time we dared to hope. I had grudgingly accepted failure and chaos, not due to the people of the island of Ireland - whether they were green or orange, but the history of Britain’s politics in Ireland did not stand up well to scrutiny. After the results were announced I still expected to be disappointed it took me years to fully accept it could work. But no matter what we think of modern day politicians they stood tall. Some thought it a victory whereas I thought it was a wasted life and 30 years. We had just been permitted to compete but had yet to start running. I had fully accepted that I wouldn’t live to reap the true rewards nor perhaps would my 10-year-old son. It will be a long slow road but at least there is a road. However Brexit will be nothing but negative for all concerned.I am embarrassed to say that I voted against the Good Friday agreement. At the time, I felt that the prisoner release scheme was a step too far and that it was difficult for people to forgive the violence and death that was part of the Troubles for so many years. I was 18 and I had always lived in Belfast and I think I found it difficult to see the broader picture. Within a very short time I was able to see the value of it ending violence and enabling politicians to engage with each other across the sectarian ide. I feel that all the politicians involved worked hard to secure the agreement and, despite some terrible atrocities in the weeks and months after, it has been successful in ending violence. I am happy that my children can now enjoy their lives without the knowledge or the threat of paramilitary violence. There continues to be ision and political uncertainty in Northern Ireland and the peace process is still very much a ‘process’, however the achievements of the Good Friday agreement mean that, eventually, we will have a stable and more progressive country. I was nearly 12, and remember the vote no graffiti going up in various places along the way from Belfast to Armagh. I was quite apathetic to the whole thing. Thankfully the Good Friday agreement seemed to have a pretty decent impact, especially after the Omagh bombing. Industry in Northern Ireland is now on the wane, and the political vacuum that exists now is really worrying. It’s really sad that the schools and residential areas are still segregated and I genuinely believe that no real difference can be made unless children realise from the earliest possible age that their neighbours from a different religion are just as benign and boring as they are. It looks as if Brexit will be wholly negative and that is because the political powers have been largely irresponsible to date. The role of Northern Ireland has straddled the odd position of being completely ignored by one side (UK) and being used as a pawn to benefit a party and leader’s status in another jurisdiction (RoI and EU negotiations). I wouldn’t be very optimistic if the changes heralded by Brexit are as drastic as some Tories and others are pushing for. Some names have been changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a783647592272d39a8e469ebe7e1b8b7a3c1f908/263_510_2655_1593/master/2655.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a46815ba82d95e9e2f19672102031725 1240w","title":"orban election victory gives us mandate to pass stop soros laws","story":"Hungarian leader says package of bills targeting civil society will be pushed through parliamentHungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has pledged to push through a controversial package of bills targeting civil society, described by his government as the “Stop Soros” package.Orbán said his Fidesz party’s landslide victory in Sunday’s parliamentary elections had given the government perhaps the strongest mandate in modern Hungarian history.“The reason we submitted this package before the elections is in order to allow the Hungarian voters to cast their vote knowing our intention on this. This has happened and we believe we are mandated by this election to pass this law.”The Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán has used scaremongering tactics about migrants and refugees as the cornerstone of his politics in the past few years, but in classic populist style, he has also required a shadowy, nefarious overlord to target. In Orbán’s case, that figure has been George Soros, who perfectly fits the bill as both insider and outsider in Hungary.Soros was born György Schwartz to a family of Hungarian Jews in 1930, but his father changed their surname to make it more Hungarian. His family split up and lived under assumed identities to escape the Holocaust, and Soros left Hungary in 1947 to study in London. He later emigrated to the US, making billions as an investor and hedge fund manager. His Open Society foundations have donated billions to promoting civil society and human rights, particularly in the former Communist countries of central and eastern Europe.Soros is a favoured target of rightwing governments worldwide, including in Israel. Hungarian officials have used criticism of Soros by Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to deflect allegations of antisemitism around their own anti-Soros campaign.However, at times, the rhetoric appears to borrow heavily from antisemitic tropes. In a March\u0026nbspspeech\u0026nbspin which he accused the political opposition of being “Soros candidates”, Orbán referred to his enemies as “not straightforward but crafty not honest but base not national but international does not believe in working but speculates with money”.Orbán, who will now serve a third consecutive term as prime minister, portrayed himself on the campaign trail as the defender of a white, Christian Hungary at risk from refugees and migrants, and under attack from George Soros, the financier and philanthropist of Jewish-Hungarian origin. The campaign was almost exclusively focused on migration, and on Tuesday Orbán said the result of the elections vindicated this choice.“The Hungarian voters have designated the most important topics: immigration and the topic of national security. Hungarians have decided they want to be the only ones who will decide who can live in Hungary.”Orbán said the government had not yet discussed the specific issue of Soros’s Budapest-based Central European University, which announced on Monday an agreement to open a satellite campus in Vienna. The prime minister also said he planned to build on diplomatic ties with Poland and the German region of Bavaria following their direct support for his re-election.Orbán refused to comment on a sharply critical preliminary report on the Hungarian elections released on Monday by international monitors, which referred to “intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric and media bias” during the campaign.Two weeks before the vote, thousands of anti-migrant billboards appeared that were theoretically unrelated to the campaign. They featured a long line of migrants, emblazoned with the word “stop”. The same photograph was used in Ukip’s controversial “breaking point” poster during the UK’s EU referendum campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d6ac5f1f3c7555a8e63ea9e57e68a5ac9f35424/0_744_5899_3539/master/5899.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=82c05a097e012b698fe71267a7459c2e 1240w","title":"what could the us target in syria and how might russia react","story":"The response to a 2017 chemical attack was largely symbolic this time it could be more comprehensiveAfter the 2017 Khan Sheikhoun attack, Donald Trump ordered a strike on the airfield that launched the Syrian jets involved. The 59 cruise missiles launched from US warships in the Mediterranean damaged runways and hangars at Shayrat but they were quickly repaired. That attack was largely symbolic. If Trump orders a second strike, it will probably be more comprehensive. The US president will be keen to assert himself as a strongman if he feels his own red line has been crossed (comparisons to Barack Obama are too much for him). France too has previously said it would be prepared to act if the use of chemical weapons is proven.Probable targets a second time round would be other Syrian airbases, and perhaps what remains of the air force itself. Whittled down and battered, the Syrian jet fleet has been heavily propped up by Russian fighters. Syria’s air defence system has been heavily damaged by Israeli attacks.The US maintains a naval battle group in the eastern Mediterranean, well stocked with over-the-horizon missiles. It has a large number of jet fighters in Qatar and on carriers in the Gulf, which are deployed to bomb Isis. The politics of flying over Iraq or Saudi Arabia to bomb the Syrian regime may prove tricky. Missiles are a more likely option. They’re harder to shoot down and it matters little if they are. Striking from the west poses fewer problems all around. French jets could hit Syrian targets after taking off from French airfields. If Britain joins the fray, it has a base on nearby Cyprus, a short hop from Syria.The RAF has a large contingent in the Middle East still engaged in action against Isis remnants and could easily ert planes and drones to Syrian military targets if required. It has Tornados posted in the region that have a reputation for flying low and precision bombing, and Typhoons armed with Paveway lV guided bombs. It also has Reaper drones equipped with Hellfire missiles. All were in action over the last few weeks in either eastern Syria or Iraq against Isis. However, the main value of the UK to any military action by the US – which is not short of firepower or expertise – would be in allowing the US to say it isn’t acting unilaterally.Though the Syrian air defence system was heavily damaged by Israeli attacks in March, it remains a threat. Its ageing missiles still fly faster than modern jets – a 45-year-old SA-5 missile brought down an Israeli F-16, prompting the Israeli counter-strikes. However, the air defence battery offers little defence to ground-hugging missiles. And more than 100 Israeli strikes had previously been launched without a plane being hit. The bigger question is whether Russia would activate its more formidable S-400 system, which has been in place in Syria for more than a year. This poses a lethal threat to the world’s most modern jets. During previous attacks, Russia has sometimes briefly turned the system on, but it has not yet used it. A warning by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to Trump not to attack could indicate a different approach a strike is ordered this time.What remains of the opposition is on its knees. It has no defence against air attacks and has lost most of its strongholds. Only Deraa in the south and Idlib in the north remain under its control, and the latter it shares with jihadists who have a very different view of what a postwar Syria should look like. For the past six years opposition leaders have been calling for no-fly zones or airstrikes to weaken the regime.Russian and Syrian jets have battered anti-Assad forces into submission, eastern Ghouta being the latest example of that. With Russia dominating the skies across at least two-thirds of Syria, a no-fly zone is not an option. The opposition pipe dream remains the ousting of the regime. But with that not a consideration for even Assad’s foes these days, the best the opposition can hope for is a weakened Syrian air force.Additional reporting by Ewen MacAskill"},{"url":null,"title":"dit-s-new-campus-at-grangegorman-takes-shape-1.3453048","story":"  April 7, 2018The biggest higher-education development in the State\u0026rsquos history will transform Dublin\u0026rsquos north-inner city.

Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty ImagesA senior member of the British Labour Party’s shadow cabinet has accused the Government of playing up the issue of the Border in Brexit negotiations for economic reasons and described the Good Friday Agreement as a “shibboleth”. Barry Gardiner, Britain’s shadow international trade secretary, told a conference in Brussels last month that fears that hardening the Border could bring a return to violence were confusing cause and effect.In a recording of his remarks, which The Irish Times has heard, he said the watchtowers and other physical infrastructure that had been built on the Border during the Troubles were removed 20 years ago to deprive terrorists of a target after the Belfast Agreement.“Now, we went back to that normal border relationship at a time when we were both - the UK and the Republic of Ireland - were in the EU, and so a normal border relationship was a completely friction-free border. “But that doesn’t mean that putting in a normal border relationship when one party is no longer in the EU will bring back paramilitary activity - that is to confuse cause and effect.“And I think we must also recognise that there are real economic reasons why people have played up the issue of the Irish border and the need to have the shibboleth of the Good Friday agreement. And that is because it is hugely in the Republic of Ireland’s economic interest to make sure that there is no tariff and no external border there,” he said.Mr Gardiner was addressing a conference organised by the European trade union movement and the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung, a political foundation attached to the German Left party, on March 20th. Mr Gardiner went on to ascribe political motives to Sinn Féin’s focus on the Border after Brexit.“And of course there are very good political reasons. Sinn Féin, who are members of this group and trusted colleagues, of course want to see the unification of Ireland and that is a political objective of Sinn Féin. “But it doesn’t mean that a normal border will bring back paramilitary activity. And so, these are deeply unfashionable remarks to make, but actually I do think that we do need to understand that there are economic reasons, there are political reasons, and they do not always concur with what we are putting forward - from all sides - as this shibboleth of the Good Friday Agreement. I think we need to actually start drilling down.”Mr Gardiner was not immediately available for comment but Owen Smith, who was sacked as Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary last month for advocating a second Brexit referendum, condemned the comments.“Labour members will be particularly shocked, but it should concern people in every party and none that there now seems to be a substantial group of senior politicians - from Daniel Hannan to Barry Gardiner - who are prepared to sacrifice the Good Friday Agreement in order to deliver Brexit. “Instead of supporting those in Northern Ireland committed to making the Agreement work, these ideological Brexiters put leaving the EU ahead of everything else. “They must be resisted by all those, who value the achievements of the Agreement, and above all the peace it has brought. If the choice is between Brexit and the Good Friday Agreement, we must support the Agreement every time,” Mr Smith said.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3456730.1523349799!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"davis-claims-sf-pushed-government-s-hard-stance-on-brexit-1.3456731","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish Brexit Secretary David Davis has claimed Sinn Féin’s growing influence in the Republic has pushed the Irish Government into taking a harder-than-expected stand in the Brexit negotiations. Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesSinn Féin’s growing influence in the Republic has pushed the Irish Government into taking a harder-than-expected stand in the Brexit negotiations , British Brexit Secretary David Davis has claimed.The charge, though much-ridiculed, has been made by a series of Conservative politicians in recent months, such as former Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Paterson, but never by a leading member of the British Cabinet.Speaking at a conference in London, the Brexit Secretary said that he had not anticipated the tough approach to negotiations taken by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who took over from Enda Kenny last June.“We had a change of government, south of the border, and with quite a strong influence from Sinn Féin, and that had an impact in terms of the approach,” he said – though he was corrected by members in the audience, who told him that no change of government had taken place.“We’ll leave our interpretations aside if you like. But the simple truth is that on both sides of the border the politics changed with the change of taoiseach and with the disappearance of the Northern Ireland executive.“That’s quite important. It’s slowed the process down slightly.”In a statement to The London Times, the Irish government quickly rejected Mr Davis’s claims: “(The Irish) position is unchanged since the time of the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership and is one which has cross-party support in Dáil Éireann.”Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney also described the comments as “way off the mark” and “nonsense”.Mr Coveney told RTE’s Morning Ireland that it would help if Mr Davis came to Dublin where he could learn about Irish politics and would realise that the idea of an Irish government being influenced by Sinn Féin was “nonsense”.Meanwhile, five former Northern Ireland secretaries of state have warned about their concerns that the introduction of a hard border between NI and the Republic, saying “that it will lead to instability that could threaten the very existence of the agreement.“The Good Friday Agreement was founded on mutually reinforcing rights and the obligations and cemented through referendums in NI and the Republic of Ireland,” wrote Peter Mandelson, John Reid, Paul Murphy, Peter Hain and Shaun Woodward.“Those who value the agreement and the peace it brought to Northern Ireland have a duty to speak up and make clear their opposition to the (British) Government’s Brexit policy,” the five former senior politicians declared.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3456739.1523351964!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gardiner-apologises-for-remarks-on-good-friday-agreement-1.3456740","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner described the agreement as a shibboleth.

Photograph: ReutersWhen British prime minister Tony Blair left Downing Street in early April 1998 and headed for Belfast to take charge of the Northern Ireland peace talks with taoiseach Bertie Ahern, it seemed all was on the verge of ruin.The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) was poised to reject the first draft of US special envoy for Northern Ireland George Mitchell’s document on what would eventually become the Belfast Agreement, with the party’s deputy leader, John Taylor, famously declaring he would not touch it “with a 40-foot bargepole”.The Belfast Agreement would go on to become the cornerstone for peace in Northern Ireland, ushering in a new era of co-operation between unionists and nationalists both at the top table of government and in terms of the political structures that stemmed from it.By Tuesday, April 7th, UUP leader David Trimble had rung Blair three times at Downing Street before faxing him a letter rejecting the deal, citing a host of complaints. Later that day Blair arrived in Belfast with his private secretary John Holmes.What occurred over the following days would change the Irish political landscape forever. Yet exhaustion and the speed of events meant that much of the detail leading to the signing of the agreement on April 10th – Good Friday – 1998, has up to now been unknown as no comprehensive minutes were known to have been kept.However, Holmes, who was blessed with good shorthand, did keep a record, which has recently been unearthed by journalist Eamon Mallie. While it is a British version of events, it is one that provides much new insight into the see-saw nature of the talks and the personalities that shaped them.“The situation looked bleak as we arrived,” Holmes wrote.Mitchell’s decision to include two long, unagreed annexes covering North-South co-operation and sections on rights, policing and prisoners, which unionists had not seen before, had pushed them “over the edge” and were “too green for their taste”, Holmes recorded.The British moved swiftly, inviting Trimble to Hillsborough to hear his concerns. “With the important exceptions of the North-South section and decommissioning, these objections did not seem insuperable,” said Holmes. “As important, he still seemed interested in a deal.”They were joined at Hillsborough by Mitchell, who agreed to sweeping changes to his draft to get the unionists on board. They worked through the night on amendments to present to the Irish side the following morning.When Ahern arrived from Dublin for breakfast, Blair outlined the landscape. “Ahern made clear in response that he and his team were ready to have a crack at amending the paper, in particular the North-South part,” wrote Holmes. “But he also stressed his own difficulties, and his fear that if one unionist set of demands was met, another one would quickly appear.”Ahern then returned to Dublin for his mother’s funeral.Holmes said the Irish delegation had been “shaken” by the unionist reaction, and were ready to make “significant changes”. The disputed annexes in Mitchell’s draft were shelved,“The process, therefore, looked as if it might get back on track,” noted Holmes.The agreement sets out a framework for the creation of a number of institutions across three so-called “strands”.Strand one dealt with the democratic institutions, and established the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, while strand two dealt with cross-Border political co-operation such as a North-South ministerial council. The final strand concerned “east-west” issues and institutions to be created between Ireland and Britain.Holmes wrote that there was “great concern” on the nationalist side that unionists were refusing to engage on strand one issues until their concerns about strand two matters were addressed.By prior agreement with Ahern, Blair did not give the UUP the new strand two text “for fear of simply triggering further unionist demands”, wrote Holmes.Ahern would not get back from Dublin until the early evening, and a “frustrating period” followed with no real negotiations. Until Ahern could prove to the unionists that the Irish were up for serious change the process was “effectively stuck”.“When he eventually did arrive for a bilateral with the prime minister, the initial atmosphere was chilly because the Irish mistakenly thought we had been trying to negotiate with Mitchell behind their back over policing and decommissioning,” said Holmes.“Apologies from the prime minister quickly restored relations, and Ahern confirmed he was ready to sign up to the paper on strand two, contingent on the unionists being ready to do a reasonable deal on other issues, notably strand one.This was followed by a crucial tripartite meeting with the unionists. Ahern made clear he was ready to make compromises.“Trimble appreciated Ahern’s return to Belfast from his mother’s funeral and suggested both sides’ political needs could be met,” Holmes recorded, adding that in “a critical intervention” John Taylor now said he thought “proper business could now be done”.It was, therefore, agreed that the UUP and Irish should meet to try to reach agreement on North-South issues. “We subsequently gave the UUP the new text, suggesting that we thought the Irish would be ready to sign up to it,” said Holmes.“The UUP and Irish eventually met late that evening for a long and evidently tense discussion. It did not focus on the new text, as we had hoped, but on the difficult issues.“It was agreed that both sides would go away overnight to draft words to reflect their respective ideas. Some of the Irish side seemed encouraged by the meeting, but Ahern himself commented that it had finished just in time, before blows were exchanged.”“He feared the delay would make things worse – a fear which proved amply justified the following morning. But Ahern was clearly too tired for an all-night session to be possible.”Later that evening Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams came in to see Blair on his own. “He was friendly and philosophical as always, but his underlying message was worrying,” said Holmes, “Sinn Féin wanted to sign up to a deal, but we had to give them a deal they could sign up to.”That had to mean more than the release of prisoners.Blair asked John Hume and Mallon immediately afterwards if they thought Sinn Féin would sign up. Both thought Adams genuinely wanted to do so. But this question was to be a constant preoccupation for the next 36 hours: “We eventually returned to Hillsborough after midnight, frustrated that so little progress had been made.”Early on Thursday, Blair rang Trimble to again say he thought a deal on strand two was possible but that the Irish were in a fragile state. He “should not therefore push his luck too far on other issues”, Blair told Trimble, “and should in particular engage quickly with the SDLP on strand one”. Trimble said he understood.Shortly afterwards, over breakfast with Blair, Ahern voiced his “extreme suspicion” about unionist intentions, recalling past failures to honour promises made in 1921 and 1973. Westminster legislation was needed to ensure that NorthSouth bodies would be created. “The Irish also showed further concern about Sinn Féin’s position,” Holmes added.Back in Castle Buildings at Stormont, a “frustrating morning” passed. “We had assumed both the Irish and UUP had been drafting overnight, but in fact neither had, and a long gap followed,” said Holmes.“It gradually became clear that the two were not capable of solving their problems bilaterally – the mutual distrust and hostility were too great. From now until virtually the end of the talks, we negotiated with both by proxy, and kept them apart.”At midday Trimble brought Blair and Holmes the unionist draft, and “made clear” it would have to be the basis of any deal. He also said decommissioning would be “a show-stopper”.Blair put the proposal to Ahern and “pushed him hard”. The taoiseach accepted that the basis of a deal was there, but again sought Westminster guarantees.Department of Foreign Affairs secretary general Dermot Gallagher studied the text in detail, and suggested more changes. Blair then put the amendments to Trimble, who accepted the essential ones. “A deal appeared to have been struck on strand two, and a breakthrough achieved,” said Holmes.Strand One negotiations now began in earnest, but problems soon appeared. “Word began to reach us of serious difficulties about the new text in the Irish camp ... and unhappiness on the part of Sinn Féin and the SDLP,” wrote Holmes.“It was a disaster. The Irish had altered the balance fundamentally, reintroducing the necessity for Westminster legislation throughout the text, and putting all the responsibility in the hands of the two governments. There was fury on our side that the deal had so quickly fallen apart.”Blair quickly told Ahern the text could not be seriously reopened, but he was ready to see if the UUP would accept lesser changes. He met Trimble and Taylor, and put the Irish changes to them. They accepted four of the six changes, believing that they did not fundamentally alter the balance of the text.“The Irish were in turn satisfied,” said Holmes, “The deal seemed to be back on, and attention could switch back to the wider problem of whether Sinn Féin would sign up to a deal, not least since Ahern had made it increasingly clear that a deal would be almost impossible for the Irish if they did not.“Ahern had already spent hours with Adams trying to persuade him the deal was worth accepting, and listening to Sinn Féin demands for improvements, particularly on policing, security, the Irish language and prisoners,” he wrote.Northern secretary Mo Mowlam had spent much of the previous two days on the latter subject, with the British side “deliberately refusing to reveal our hand”, he said.However, Sinn Féin’s public line had turned negative. Fearing collapse, there were “two very long meetings” with just Blair and Ahern on one side, and Adams and Martin McGuinness on the other. This was followed by a 3am telephone call to Adams from US president Bill Clinton, which “seemed to turn the tide”.“It eventually became clear early in the morning of April 10th that, while they would not sign up to the deal on the spot, not least because of their annual conference a week later, they were ready to make positive noises about it and argue for it.“It was made clear in return that while we would stick for now to the planned two-year release deadline for prisoners, we would be ready to advance this if Sinn Féin did sign up and circumstances allowed.”Early on Friday morning the UUP accepted the essence of what they had rejected for so long: a Northern Ireland Executive with a first minister and deputy first minister, and a reasonable form of sufficient cross-community consensus for voting on key issues.“Exhaustion was combined with a degree of satisfaction and optimism,” said Holmes. “But we were also uncomfortably aware that there was bound to be a last-minute obstacle, and the UUP would no doubt find reasons to dislike the texts.”A mini-crisis then arose over the annex listing the areas where separate or joint North-South implementation bodies would be set up. The Irish were unhappy since just 12 were proposed, together with the fact that few of them were what they had wanted.They claimed to have persuaded the UUP during the night to accept an Irish language promotion body and a trade Promotion and indigenous company development body, both of which the UUP had fiercely resisted. “We stupidly took their word for it,” said Holmes.“When the UUP saw the new list they blew a fuse, accused the Irish of duplicity and refused to accept any more than the original list. The Irish in turn dug in their heels, and a lengthy impasse followed, with Mitchell (whose role in the previous 48 hours had effectively been zero) unable to circulate a new text and getting increasingly angry.“We were also tearing our hair out. Eventually the prime minister brought Ahern and Trimble together again. Trimble had been given fierce instructions by his colleagues not to accept another body or not to bother coming back. He was adamant. Ahern pressed, but in vain.“Eventually Trimble, at his most boorish, was persuaded to propose again a pretty meaningless health body. We sold this to an unhappy Ahern on the basis of an additional reference in the text to other bodies being considered and an exchange of letters with Trimble where Ahern set out four Irish requests again, and Trimble agreed to consider them later.“This fudge allowed the text to be circulated around midday. We sat back and waited for the next problems,” Holmes added.They were not long in coming. First, the UUP insisted the Anglo-Irish secretariat at Maryfield be closed by the end of the year, but the Irish resisted further concessions to the UUP.“Faced with the prospect of selling to their community a deal involving Sinn Féin at the Assembly and government table with no guarantee of decommissioning, with all prisoners out in two years...they were losing their nerve.”Blair spoke to Trimble several times by phone. “We deployed all the big picture arguments we could,” said Holmes. “But Trimble still seemed to be losing the argument and to share most of his colleagues’ reservations. It began to look hopeless, and despair took hold.”Trimble eventually brought a senior UUP delegation to see Blair. “All effectively said the text was unacceptable and unsaleable to unionists,” said Holmes. “The prime minister let his despair show but said he was ready to help if he could, but not by reopening the text itself.“The delegation made clear that the single biggest issue was the prospect of sitting round the cabinet table with Sinn Féin when there had been no decommissioning. The prime minister promised to consider this.“When they had left we concocted a letter to Trimble making clear that, if after six months of the Assembly the present rules to promote non-violent methods had proved ineffective, we would support changing the rules to give them teeth.“We sent this off without much hope, and meanwhile enlisted Clinton’s help through a direct phone call to Trimble. The cause still looked all but hopeless, although Trimble had said one or two things which suggested he was determined to make his colleagues swallow the agreement.”Suddenly, at about 4.30pm, the picture changed again. “Rumours reached us that, following the prime minister’s letter and Clinton’s call, Trimble had taken renewed heart and called a vote, which he had narrowly won.“This seemed too good to be true, but Trimble quickly rang to confirm that the way was now clear for the plenary to be held, and Mitchell arranged it for 5pm.”The plenary itself was relatively devoid of drama.

It brightens up the venue, a party warehouse hidden inside a bare industrial estate, sandwiched between Berlin’s erse Neukölln and Treptow areas.Tonight the venue has become a gathering for Irish people – more than 1,300km away from where the referendum on May 25th will take place.The referendum will ask voters if they want to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which grants equal right to life to the mother and unborn child.The Berlin-Ireland pro-choice solidarity group organised “Plugged in for Repeal” to highlight how people can vote in the referendum or campaign, as well as raise money and remove the stigma of abortion.Dozens of people have already arrived at 9.30pm.\u0026nbspThe atmosphere is intense but cheerful as conversation moves from serious talk on the effects of the Eighth Amendment to “soli shots” (solidarity shots) and homemade Guinness cake.Is this an occasion to celebrate or prepare for the fight ahead? Both it seems.Maebh Murphy, from Waterford, moved to Berlin in 2008. The 33 year old, who works in the music industry, co-founded the pro-choice group with Dervla O’Malley, in 2012.She says “the buzz” of the party is because the referendum is finally happening – and feels fairly positive about the outcome.Under Irish electoral law, Irish citizens retain their right to vote for 18 months after moving abroad. There is no postal vote from abroad so eligible voters must travel back to have their say.Although she can’t vote, Murphy wants to go back to Ireland with her husband, who’s from Cork, and their three-year-old daughter but is unsure if the family can afford it.Despite being fervently pro-choice, she can understand arguments on the other side.“I would never talk about a clump of cells because people in my family have gone through miscarriages,” she says. “I totally understand the different feelings towards it and I also think you can make your own choice yourself.”But she feels angry about pro-life lobbyists using children with Down syndrome in their campaigns.When she was pregnant, Murphy was given the choice of receiving a chromosome abnormalities test in Germany but decided against it.“It’s just really insulting to think that if you had the choice then the only choice you would make is to abort all the babies because this is not the case. People will still have kids.”Cora Quigley, from Dublin, moved to Berlin in January last year. The 28 year old’s time abroad is within the 18-month limit so she will fly back to vote and is doing all she can to raise the issue.“I’ve already had a discussion with my mother which went really well,” says Quigley. “It’s important to have conversations in your family because people don’t really talk about it. Even people who appear liberal in other ways might be on the fence.”PhD geography student Lorna O’Hara splits her time between her home city of Dublin and Berlin.The 30 year old, who can vote and will return, has also been having difficult conversations.“It’s hard to look at someone who you love and know their opinion is so different,” says O’Hara. “I’ve been an activist for six years, I know the facts. But when I sat down with my mother all of that flew out the window because you just fall apart.“I think it was the emotion in that conversation that got her to see it from my perspective.”Clíodhna Walsh, a writer from Waterford, says being unable to cast a postal vote is a major disadvantage. “I haven’t found a job yet in Berlin but I’m going to book flights anyway and hope for the best.”As a doula who helps women in pregnancy and abortion, 27-year-old Kilkenny-born Jes Walsh,\u0026nbspwho has been in Berlin for five years and will go back to Ireland to campaign, says: “I don’t see abortion as an act of violence. I see it as violence when you hold people back from their choices.”The group was launched six years ago after the death of Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital Galway due to the complications of a septic miscarriage.“We had quite a few protests outside the Irish Embassy and vigils,” says co-founder Dervla O’Malley, from Galway. “Every year on the anniversary of Savita’s death we hold a vigil.”O’Malley, who has been making sure the event runs smoothly, says the money raised will go to abortion rights and support groups in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.“This referendum is well overdue,” she says. “We’ve waited a long time for this.”Outside, the industrial estate is cold and grey – the opposite of the electric atmosphere among the Irish expats. Physically they are in Berlin. But these emigrants feel more connected to Ireland than ever.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum hereThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"real story anne craig coach accused encouraging false memories","story":"Anne Craig leaving the High Court in 2016What made two seemingly happy young women from loving homes sever all contact with their families and friends, renounce their inheritances and  vanish into thin air? Mick Brown investigates how a self-styled ‘personal development coach’ digging for ‘forgotten’ childhood memories opened a door to catastrophe Towards the end of 2016 I received a telephone call asking whether I would be interested in talking to a woman named Anne Craig.
