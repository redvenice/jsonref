It was grabbed from fishmongers\u0027 hall before being used to confront the terrorist. The tusks are so strong that in the 19th century one pierced the two and a half inch thick ship hullIt was commonly supposed that they came from unicorns and their association with this mythical beast meant that the tusks were somehow magical and had miraculous curative powers.In his History of the Worthies of England in 1662, historian Thomas Fuller observed that the tusk was ‘antidotal to several venoms’ and that it could resist poisons.It was said that just a few grains of ground-up tusk was a ‘great cure against poison’, although the historian was somewhat doubtful and speculated that very few would ever dare put it to the test.But whether the tusk was medicinal or not, there is no doubt that there was an extremely lucrative trade in these ‘unicorn horns’, just as there is with rhinoceros horns today. They could be astonishingly expensive and be worth more than ten times their weight in gold.One lucky owner was no less a figure than Queen Elizabeth I, who was given a tusk by the privateer Martin Frobisher.         Scientists still don\u0027t know what Narwhals use their tusk, which is actually an elongated tooth, for. They have been observed hitting cod with it to make them easier to catch and some have even theorised that the tusks could be used for communication         It was grabbed from the Fishmongers\u0027 Hall in London and used to fight off the terroristShe placed what became known as the Horn of Windsor in the Royal Wardrobe and Treasury.In 1598, it was valued at £10,000 – which is the equivalent of some £2million today.Sadly for the Royal Family, the ‘horn’ no longer survives as it disappeared from the Tower of London during the Civil War.It was reputed to have been destroyed by the Puritans, who did not care for the object’s supposed association with magic.Today, tusks are somewhat cheaper than they were in Elizabethan times. In October 2013, John Jeffries, of Tregony, Cornwall, sold a fine example for £36,000, which still, of course, puts hanging a tusk above the mantelpiece out of the reach of most.Curiously, a plaque on that tusk revealed that it had been presented in 1881 to a sailor called Cornelius Fudge, which happens to be the name of a Harry Potter character. Author JK Rowling herself has insisted this is a complete coincidence.While the tusk sold by Mr Jeffries was over 8ft long, and a good 3ft longer than that bravely brandished by Luckasz, the tusks can grow to around 18ft.This raises the question of what exactly the narwhal uses it for.              The narwhal tusk is pictured here being used by the Polish-born chef Luckasz to confront the London Bridge terroristWhat first needs to be appreciated is that the tusk is, in fact, a tooth – a very extended canine tooth that projects from the left side of the upper jaw through the lip and forms a left-handed spiral as it grows.Despite lots of research, it seems that marine boffins are not completely sure of the tusk’s function. What is known is that it is hollow and contains some ten million nerve endings, which makes it likely that it is used to assess the condition of the water.It was previously thought that when males rub their tusks together, this was part of some masculine dominance ritual.But scientists now believe that the narwhals – which can live for some 50 years – are actually communicating with each other.Of course, it seems unthinkable that the narwhal would not use the tusk as a weapon and indeed it appears that they do.In May 2017, aerial footage of a pod of narwhals showed them using their tusks to knock out some cod, thereby making it easier to eat them. What the narwhals did not do was to use the tusks as spears but rather as clubs.It does seem satisfying that there is still some mystery attached to the narwhal and its tusk. They are shy creatures and they do not give up their secrets easily.There is still something magical about them, something vestigial of the old name for them – the sea unicorn. And, of course, even though it seems bizarre in the extreme that a narwhal tusk was used as a weapon last Friday, we should not let our British love of the absurd obscure the deep tragedy of that day."},{"url":null,"title":"14 church goers massacred eastern Burkina Faso","story":"Share this article More than 700 people have been killed in Islamist unrest since fighting spilled across the border from Mali, according to an AFP count.An ambush on a convoy transporting employees of a Canadian mining company in eastern Burkina Faso earlier this month killed 37 people, the deadliest attack in nearly five years of jihadist violence.

These risks include regulation, taxation, competitive disadvantage, brand impairment, financing, physical asset impairment and litigation.” TCI said disclosure should include targets for emissions reduction.The hedge fund also warned it would vote against auditors where the annual report and accounts failed to report material climate risks. It threatened to dump investments where a “portfolio company refuses to disclose emissions and does not have a credible plan for their reduction”.Sir Christopher Hohn, the billionaire hedge fund manager who set up and runs TCI, told the Financial Times: “Investing in a company that doesn’t disclose its pollution is like investing in a company that doesn’t disclose its balance sheet. If governments won’t force disclosure, then investors can force it themselves.”The UK government is working with regulators in London to decide whether mandatory reporting on climate risks is necessary for publicly listed companies and big investment funds and pension schemes.This summer the UK became the first G7 country to sign into law a commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and its green finance strategy published in July said the financial sector must lead the way. It called for more investment in sustainable projects and infrastructure, and said changes include “setting expectations for publicly listed companies and large asset owners to disclose by 2022 how climate change risk impacts their activities”.Hohn accused BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, of “greenwash” because it does not require emissions disclosures. “Asset owners should fire asset managers that do not require such disclosure,” he said.“Investors don’t need to wait on regulators who are asleep at the switch and unwilling or unable to regulate emissions properly,” he said. “They can use their voting power to force change on companies who refuse to take their environmental emissions seriously. Investors have the power, and they have to use it.”TCI’s move comes as the world’s governments meet in Madrid this week for the UN climate summit, and as the UN appointed the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who steps down in January, as its special envoy for climate action and finance from February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2765b3426baceeed1e68475724db251d4f41e223/19_0_3170_1902/master/3170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e019a922ec40deac415834b673c75ec","title":"cyber monday 2019 best deals bargains and the latest news","story":"Our Cyber Monday live blog will help you find the best deals, and point out some ethical and sustainable ways to mitigate the environmental impactOne absolute “Urgh!” of Black Friday is I’ve just seen some stats about the increased number of flights sold over the weekend.

There’s no better time to do what makes you happy than in your 40s. From living your passions to saying what’s really on your mind, six fortysomething women share their tips How are you? Busy, I’ll bet. Maybe you’ve felt frantic for so long you can’t imagine a time when you’ll have a moment to yourself. Take that moment now. Here, six remarkable women in their 40s reveal what freedom means to them – and how you can get more of it.‘Never say “I’m fine” when you’re not’Laurence Sessou, 40, massage therapist, LondonFreedom means being honest about who you are and how you feel. In so many ways for so many years I lied to myself. I wore many masks to conform. Being honest with yourself starts with a basic thing: I no longer say “I’m fine” when I’m not feeling great. I don’t pretend everything is OK. I say how I’m feeling. Telling the truth is liberating, however difficult it might be sometimes. As a therapist I ask clients how they’re feeling and they’ll tell me they’re fine. Really? It’s something we say out of habit and it does not serve us. “How fine are you really then?” I ask, and then we can open up and start to feel better.‘Getting away for a microholiday as a couple is essential to my marriage’Kate Parker, 42, communications professional, Shropshire‘Don’t give up doing cool things. Even if it means going solo’Jiao Jennings, 40, international business consultant, LondonNow’s the time to come clean and say what you want to do. A girls’ holiday in Ibiza is not me anymore – horrible idea! Why spend precious time doing things you don’t want to do? The key is not to be afraid of doing things by yourself. Recently I went to the Modigliani exhibition at Tate Modern and spent two luxurious hours wandering around looking at the show solo. Another time I spontaneously got up early for an incredible yoga class in the V\u0026ampA courtyard. If a friend wants to come, great, but I don’t want to give up doing cool things, or to feel like I’m dragging someone along with me. It makes friendships simpler and stronger: when we get together we happily pick up where we left off, even if it’s been six months.‘Knowing that I can do something I’m slightly scared of makes me think I can do anything’Caroline Crowther, 40, fundraiser, EssexWhenever I plan a relaxing evening – simple stuff like watching TV with my partner or having a bath – that time gets eaten into by kids, working late or household chores. It’s not surprising that I’ve felt pretty stressed for almost as long as I can remember. Then my best friend gave me trapeze lessons for my 40th birthday, with the idea that if I booked out the time in my diary then I’d treat it with the same respect as I would a board meeting. I always make time for my class. Partly because I feel accountable – the class is booked – but mostly because I love trapeze. I’m terrified of falling flat on my face, but hanging on to the bar and flying through the air is exhilarating. Afterwards I have more energy and I feel inspired. Knowing that I can do something I’m slightly scared of makes me think I can do anything.‘I’ve shaken off the idea that I should settle down and have a proper job’Jo Carnegie, 44, journalist and advice columnist, BedfordshireNot going down the traditional fortysomething path of having a family is liberating because I’m free to find my own way. I don’t have to worry whether I’m making the right or wrong choices – they’re just my choices. For example, for the past five years I’ve been volunteering at a charity in India, Tree of Life for Animals, working out there for a month or two each year. It’s a massive part of who I am now just as important as my life back here. I’ve shaken off the idea that I should stay at home, settle down and have a proper job. I can choose what fulfils me.‘I had no time to pursue my passion, so I turned it into my job’Emily Murray, 41, founder of The Pink House, EdinburghWhat with two kids, a marriage, a mortgage, septuagenarian parents and some semblance of a social life, I realised there’s scarce time to pursue my own passions unless I make it my actual job. So when I went back to work after an extended maternity leave, I founded my interiors business with this in mind. Essentially, my job is to convey my enthusiasm for interiors to other people, so every day I’m dovetailing work and joy. I’m not trying to squeeze in work and play as it all wraps into one. My business model is basically if something grabs me, I grab it back, whether it’s a technicolour wallpaper, bizarre lampshade or a week-long design reccy in a luxurious Alpine ski chalet.Beauty is ageless.

At the request of the non-Batek tour guides, Batek people hurriedly hide their televisions, radios and mobile phones. “Tourists don’t like to see these,” they explain.As an anthropologist who has conducted field research with Batek people for many years, I have become familiar with these common expectations placed on hunter-gatherers. It’s difficult to say exactly how many hunter-gatherers there are in the world. There is a general lack of demographic data, and the boundary between who is and isn’t considered a hunter-gatherer isn’t always neat.They are also erse, for example from the Batek of Malaysia to the Mbendjele of Congo-Brazzaville, and the Agta of the Philippines. Their practices may vary, yet popular expectations of what they should be like are fixed.Often, these rely on the assumption that today’s humans are, in essence, prehistoric hunter-gatherers trapped in modern life, and that this mismatch is the source of our ills. Desiring an antidote, we look to modern-day hunter-gatherers, conflate them with prehistoric relics, and fetishise them as “the noble savage”: an ideal representation of simplicity and happiness. Ultimately, this reveals more about our needs than it does about them.I’m becoming increasingly aware that two early modern understandings of hunter-gatherers that emerged during European colonial expansion still endure in the UK. The first is Rousseau’s view of primordial man existing in a simple “state of nature”, happy because he has few desires. The second is the Hobbesian view, that premodern life was “nasty, brutish, and short” – thank God for “civilisation”.Either way, the assumption is that an amorphous hunter-gatherer past and present represents a less complicated way of existing. This is a derogatory yet persistent belief. One recent literary review published in the London Review of Books notes of the Penan in Borneo that “they foraged, hunted and ate, and moved through the forest in the only way they knew, and then they died”. In one fell swoop, Penan people are denied any trace of humanity, of any joy, desires, hope or even free will. Instead, their lives centre on unthinking, base survival.Similar tropes are prevalent in popular media. I have been contacted by TV producers who want to film the Batek for documentaries or immersive reality shows. One suggested that because some Batek people live fairly close to small towns, they wouldn’t be “authentic” enough for her show. Living with them would be “more like a holiday than a real experience”. It was unclear how the Batek could be much more authentic, given that they are Batek. The show was never made.Hunter-gatherer-style activities are also presented as a way to promote mindfulness. Helping people with anxiety is legitimate, but the unwitting implication is that hunter-gatherers are so simple that they are unaffected by the anxieties of modern life. This line of reasoning can be extended to health: if only we would adopt the Paleo diet, eschewing all processed foods, we too could be fit and healthy, like hunter-gatherers.When hunter-gatherers are held up as the antidote to modern life, it becomes a modernity from which they are excluded. Yet they exist on the same planet as everyone else – and with as much right to human dignity.In the chaos of the environmental destruction, alienation and anxiety produced by the failed promises of capitalism, and as knowledge of these issues becomes more widespread, we ask these hunter-gatherers to provide our answers, to oppose everything that causes us suffering. This is exoticisation. It is also both unjust and ironic. At the same time as we revere the idea of the noble savage, we continue to contribute to the global processes of climate crisis, commodity trade and the extractive industries that rob hunter-gathers of their livelihoods.It is often they who suffer most acutely the effects of relentless capitalist environmental destruction. The world over, they are subject to discrimination, violent dispossession and illegal land grabs and associated threats to their health and wellbeing.Instead of taking up the Paleo diet, we must listen carefully to the range of hunter-gatherers’ experiences of how they want to live, the pressures they face, and their erse and in-depth knowledge on all kinds of issues including economics, equality, conservation and environmental ship. Their knowledge of such matters is invaluable. But we cannot require them to provide the answers to problems that they did not cause. What we must do is listen to them on their own terms, and we must vigorously resist resource exploitation and consumption patterns that threaten human ersity. As the tourists walk up the pathway to the camp, a few Batek men decide who will do the demonstration. A young man offers to demonstrate starting a fire. The kindling doesn’t catch, and the tour guide laughs. In English, he tells the British tourists: “He won’t be able to marry yet. A Batek man must demonstrate he can make fire before he is allowed to marry.” This is a fabrication. The tour guide blows on a tube of bamboo, making a piercing whistle. He says: “This is what Batek hunters do to tempt monkeys to them.” The Batek woman next to me bursts out laughing and whispers, “If a hunter did that, the monkeys would all run away.”• Alice Rudge lectures and researches in social anthropology at University College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbc8fb2ee9bf58bea30686eee44dbde11c24a4d9/0_125_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e43a9862201135dbf6afb03906fa237a","title":"labour red wall brexit progressive industrial england","story":"Some kind of Brexit must happen before progressive politics has a chance again in post-industrial EnglandAcombination of long-term cultural shifts and the fallout from the 2016 referendum have disrupted the electoral map in this general election, and two kinds of English places stick out. In one group – exemplifed by such recent Labour wins as Canterbury and Kensington, and talk of the Tories losing some Home Counties suburbs – are the kind of constituencies where a broadly liberal, educated element is repulsed by the Conservatives’ reinvention as an anti-European, decidedly nasty party. Meanwhile, politicos are newly obsessed with the second: a very different swath of seats that are post-industrial and less affluent, where a majority of people voted leave and politics seems to be in a fascinating state of flux.This “red wall” includes, to quote from the Mail on Sunday, “the constituencies in the Midlands and the north which have historically voted Labour, but are swinging towards the Tories because of Mr Corbyn’s opaque Brexit policy”. Our exit from the EU – or, rather, the fact that it has yet to happen – is certainly a big part of what is afoot. But if Labour shows signs of weakness in these places, many of the reasons stretch back decades. In that sense, however people vote, the sudden arrival of these places at the heart of politics marks a welcome turn away from the vapid politics of “aspiration” towards something altogether more vital and visceral. It also asks massive questions of the left about whom it wants to represent, and where its politics is going.Last week, I spent four days travelling from Wolverhampton to Darlington, via the old Nottinghamshire coalfields and the Lincolnshire town of Grimsby: all said to be areas where the Tories may well be in with a serious chance of winning. I spoke to a lot of people – older leavers, in the main – who talked about their affinity with Labour as something from the past, were bitterly dismissive of Jeremy Corbyn, and set on voting for Boris Johnson, even if their view of the Tory leader was often deeply sceptical. Equally, the stereotype of politically aware young people avidly consuming the election on their phones and determined to vote Labour is real, and often impressive.In between lay a varied array of voters, many of whom vividly conveyed why – notwithstanding Labour ticking up in the polls – the party seems to have no chance of convincingly beating such an awful government, with such a terrible record. I met people who work as teaching assistants and care workers, still uncertain whom to vote for, with a view of Labour characterised not by contempt but a puzzled sense of distance. Running through a great deal of what I heard was a point voiced time and again by all kinds of people: in the absence of Brexit being delivered, why should they trust politicians to do anything else?And then there are the even more profound political factors. Go to such cities as Manchester and Plymouth, and you instantly get a sense that Labour has renewed its identity, and reaped the rewards. In too many other places, by contrast, there is often a sense of historically complacent party establishments, and failures frozen into the architecture: the Soviet-esque office block nudging the Victorian terrace, the grim multi-storey car park.Everywhere I go, there is no end of social innovation happening, usually in the form of grassroots initiatives that prove that some communitarian, compassionate ideals run as deep in the old Labour heartlands as they ever did. But politics too often seems irrelevant. In Grimsby, I spent time at Centre4, which offers everything from financial help for new small businesses, through support for people experiencing loneliness, to a gym. Its volunteers – women, for the most part – talked about the election as an extraneous event that didn’t much interest them.If what we are facing is a deepening estrangement between progressive politics and the people and places it once spoke to as a matter of instinct, even more difficult arguments rear their heads. If you see a certain kind of old, white, working-class man and think that progressive politics ought to have nothing to do with him, you should maybe understand that your opinion is an indication of huge political failure.We also need to understand that the young person taking passionately about Corbyn and embracing his brand of social justice does not represent an entire generation. At a shopping parade in the Wolverhampton neighbourhood of Penn I met two sparky, loquacious twentysomethings whose jobs pay less than £9 an hour: he a duty manager at a town-centre hotel, she a care assistant. When I asked them whether they had thought of joining a trade union, they bluntly told me they did not know what that term meant. Neither did they have any sense of what the Labour party stands for. After talking to them, I sat in the car and listened to Len McCluskey imploring the party’s lost voters to “come home”. What does that even mean any more?The same, it pains me to say, applies to all the lingering noise about the Brexit referendum somehow being overturned and the need for a second vote. I am a passionate remainer. Instinctively, the prospect of binning the Brexit result lifts my spirits since 2016, one of the most frustrating aspects of British politics has been Labour’s refusal to talk meaningfully about our exit from the EU and the Tory fantasies that have propelled it. But at the same time, much more difficult thoughts are inescapable.Once a culture of industry, trade unionism and reflex Labour-voting had started to wane, people in post-industrial England felt increasingly cut off from politics. Whatever its inbuilt mendacities, the referendum was presented as a clear, era-defining choice and whatever their motivations, people voted in good faith. Which brings me to my own tortured ambivalence, and a conclusion that has been rattling around my head since I got back from the red wall trip: unless millions of voters’ exasperation with what has happened since 2016 is convincingly answered, and some kind of Brexit takes place, the chances of any firm reconnection between progressive politics and its supposed ancient heartlands look slim.That, undeniably, is one of the key reasons why a party led by an Eton-educated chancer is forecast to perform strongly in seemingly unlikely places – and why, even if Labour holds on in these seats, it has no end of work to do. If your response to that is a mixture of horror and bafflement, do not blame the voters. Think about your own side, from the Corbyn-supporting left to the liberal remain hardcore, and absences and estrangements out in the country that still seem a long way from receiving any kind of convincing answers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5763e8bb8e9d5e801d943e8f77789e514ad4e47/0_0_6048_3629/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92eae5e48baae0aa381884a846248829","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of frozen","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘frozen’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘frozen’.Share your photos of what frozen means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 4 December at 10am.

And with its exhilarating blend of cultures, plus a spotlight on film, fashion, sports and arts, there’s always something to celebrate in Canada’s largest cityWalking Toronto’s streets is like stepping into the pages of an atlas. The city’s multicultural mix is everywhere in its colourful neighbourhoods – five Chinatowns, a Greektown, Little Portugal, Little Italy, Little Jamaica, Korea Town, plus numerous other enclaves ranging from Ukrainian to Ethiopian. It all adds up to a restaurant scene that takes variety to a new level.Cosmopolitan Toronto also does fine dining superbly well, with menus that raid the Canadian larder for Nova Scotia lobster, Newfoundland crab, Prince Edward Island grass-fed beef and maple syrup from Ontario’s very own Lanark County. Try the inventive dishes that mingle Canadian and international flavours at the ONE restaurant at the Hazelton Hotel in swish Yorkville, or sublime plates with a view at Canoe on the 54th floor of the TD Bank Tower in the Financial District. Hot new arrivals on the foodie scene include Aloette, run by chef Patrick Kriss, which champions bistro dishes – from Burgundy snails with Puy lentils, to pulled lamb in couscous. And don’t miss the desserts at Bacchanal pastry chef Cori Osborne produces exquisite treats like Paris-Brest and babas au rhum.Along with fine-dining restaurants, Toronto is fast becoming known for a more simple pleasure: beer. Whole neighbourhoods have been given a new lease of life thanks to the steady rise of microbreweries – just wander down the streets of the Junction in the west of the city to see how the Indie Ale House and Junction Craft Brewing transformed this former down-at-heel neighbourhood. You’ll be spoiled for choice, too, among the laid-back bars of Ossington Avenue and the burgeoning craft breweries on Geary Avenue in Bloordale.Toronto’s cultural life is as rich as its restaurant menus. Come in September to catch glimpses of film stars during the Toronto International Film Festival, one of the largest in the world that’s open to the public. In June, the Luminato Festival celebrates Toronto’s creative spirit with 10 days of music, theatre, dance and visual arts events.There’s a chilled-out, family-friendly atmosphere at the fun Toronto International BuskerFest, which takes over Woodbine Park on the eastern lakeshore in the last few days of August. Photography fans can enjoy the largest photography event in the world during the Scotiabank CONTACT festival in May, when more than 200 exhibitions take place around the city.If your visit doesn’t coincide with any of Toronto’s festivals, however, get your cultural fix at the Royal Ontario Museum, whose exhibits  the globe and go back to prehistoric times. Around the corner is the Gardiner Museum, which showcases artistic ingenuity through the medium of pottery and ceramics. And for the more fashion-focused, the Bata Shoe Museum has a riveting collection of footwear that goes back 4,500 years.If standing on the glass floor near the top of the CN Tower isn’t hair raising enough for you, strap yourself into a harness and take the EdgeWalk around the outside of the highest free-standing structure in the western hemisphere. They call it Toronto’s most extreme attraction, and they’re not exaggerating.Come back down to earth gently next door at Ripley’s Aquarium, which turns into an underwater jazz club on the second Friday of each month. There’s more music in store at Casa Loma, a wondrous Gothic fantasy castle built more than a century ago by a rich financier. Its garden is a magical setting for summertime classical concerts.For an unusual night at the museum, join the dancing at Friday Night Live at the Royal Ontario Museum. While DJs and artists perform, snack at the pop-up food stalls and check out the galleries by night. There’s a similar vibe at the Art Gallery of Ontario’s First Thursdays, with live music and the food-focused Night Market.The city buzzes all year round, thanks to a busy festival calendar that guarantees fun every month. Summer brings some of the city’s biggest outdoor parties, including the Caribbean-inspired Toronto Caribbean Carnival .

But even if it stays stable there’s a story where people could say: ‘Well, Michael Gove made all those reforms that were meant to raise standards but nothing’s changed’,” said John Jerrim, a professor of social statistics at UCL’s Institute of Education.“With the Conservatives having been in power for nine years, most of the children taking part will have spent most of their time at school under Conservative or coalition governments. High scores or low, there will be spin put on that.”Jerrim warns that the Pisa results are likely to show few shifts in the underlying performances of British pupils, no matter where they are taught.“The cross-country stuff is boring because nothing really changes,” Jerrim said, pointing to movements in Pisa rankings caused largely because of new entrants while the underlying scores for rich countries such as England have remained broadly stable.“The differences between England and France or Germany on the Pisa scale is only 10 to 15 points usually, which is a really small difference. In terms of magnitude it’s not really anything to shout about.“There’s a tendency for people to over-interpret what are actually quite small differences.”Comparing the three sets of Pisa outcomes since 2009 shows remarkable consistency in the test scores of 15-year-olds in England. In the 2009 tests, England scored 493 in maths, followed by 495 in the 2012 edition, and 493 in 2015. The three years saw a similar pattern in reading (495, 500, 500) and science (515, 516, 512).At the same time, the UK’s overall school performance has remained close to the OECD average.Dr Sue Grey, a researcher at the Institute of Education in London, who studied the impact of Pisa on public perception and policymaking, said politicians would use its results to support their own agendas no matter what the outcomes.Grey pointed to Gove’s use of Pisa’s data on school autonomy in successful countries to support his drive for free schools and academies, even though the OECD said schools in England already had more autonomy than those in east Asia being held up as models.Similarly, a government push to adopt maths teaching methods from China was inspired by the Pisa success of schools in Shanghai. But the Department for Education’s own analysis found “no evidence” it had led to improvements in schools in England.“People should bring a healthy degree of scepticism to any claims made by politicians of any party based on evidence from Pisa,” Grey said.“Politicians will use the Pisa results to support whatever agenda they wish to pursue anyway, to hide the real issues they don’t want to speak about, and history suggests they won’t be challenged on any misuse or twisting of Pisa data in this way.”Jerrim said there was also troubling questions about how the OECD arrives at its published scores for each country, using methodology he described as “a mysterious black box” that outsiders, including himself, had been unable to replicate.“No one really knows how Pisa scores are created and the OECD really aren’t transparent about it,” Jerrim said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66fb9becb904f006c8ce191d72285b4aaa7e4be/14_0_4547_2728/master/4547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=077cf97565c36f670d54895bfd42d850","title":"coal power becoming uninsurable as firms refuse cover","story":"US insurers join retreat from European insurers meaning coal projects cannot be built or operatedThe number of insurers withdrawing cover for coal projects more than doubled this year and for the first time US companies have taken action, leaving Lloyd’s of London and Asian insurers as the “last resort” for fossil fuels, according to a new report.The report, which rates the world’s 35 biggest insurers on their actions on fossil fuels, declares that coal – the biggest single contributor to climate change – “is on the way to becoming uninsurable” as most coal projects cannot be financed, built or operated without insurance.Ten firms moved to restrict the insurance cover they offer to companies that build or operate coal power plants in 2019, taking the global total to 17, said the Unfriend Coal campaign, which includes 13 environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Client Earth and Urgewald, a German NGO. The report will be launched at an insurance and climate risk conference in London on Monday, as the UN climate summit gets underway in Madrid.The first insurers to exit coal policies were all European, but since March, two US insurers – Chubb and Axis Capital – and the Australian firms QBE and Suncorp have pledged to stop or restrict insurance for coal projects.Peter Bosshard, one of the Unfriend Coal campaign co-ordinators, said: “We hope within two to three years it will be so difficult to obtain insurance that most coal projects won’t be able to go forward.As global temperatures climb, hurricanes, wildfires and floods have become more frequent and severe, resulting in higher claims bills for insurers.Lloyd’s, the world’s biggest insurance market, is the only major European firm which continues to insure new coal projects.Bosshard said it had a critical role to play: “Together with Asian insurers, the Lloyd’s market is becoming the ‘lender of last resort’ for a dying and destructive industry.”Lloyd’s started excluding coal from its investments in its own £4bn central mutual fund in April 2018. However, its chief executive John Neal last month ruled out issuing guidelines on underwriting coal projects to its member syndicates.Lloyd’s said: “We take climate change extremely seriously and recognise the important role insurance can play in supporting, accelerating and de-risking the transition to a low carbon economy.“Whilst Lloyd’s Corporation does not set underwriting policy in the market, except if there is a specific legal or regulatory requirement to do so, we are nevertheless committed to building consensus across the 90-plus syndicates that operate at Lloyd’s about how we make this transition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59afd66dd7e3fc1aa5688ecc34adc0072fd8f485/18_789_1663_998/master/1663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8826789a14df5753b0c479a4ec189059","title":"a cold snap what to wear in december in pictures","story":"Padded jackets, prints on prints and knee-high boots – this winter doesn’t have to be all warmth and no style"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/699d96a1f7fdb50f77405468aeb05c499dffd122/0_292_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31c4400f8766be02334252daedf76ad3","title":"martin scorsese the irishman dont watch on phone netflix","story":"Five days after director’s mob epic hits Netflix, Scorsese urges viewers to see it on as big a screen as possibleMartin Scorsese has implored audiences not to watch his films – or those by other directors – on their smartphones.Scorsese was speaking to the Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers in the wake of the Netflix streaming release of his latest film, The Irishman.“I would suggest,” said Scorsese, “if you ever want to see one of my pictures, or most films – please, please don’t look at it on a phone, please. An iPad, a big iPad, maybe.”Following a three-week run in cinemas – where it continues to be shown – The Irishman was made available on Netflix accounts last Thursday. Netflix do not officially release viewing figures, or box office receipts, but numbers for both are likely to be high.Opinion on social media has been split between those championing a cinema viewing for the film, which stars Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci and those embracing its smaller-screen accessibility.Some users have proudly shown themselves watching the film on an Apple phone.Others, meanwhile, have offered guidance about how best to break the three-and-a-half-hour film into a manageable miniseries.This format was emphatically rejected by Scorsese. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, he said he had “never even thought of it” as suited to being .Scorsese, who made an advert for the iPhone 4s in 2012, is winning some of the best reviews of his career for the film, which employs cutting-edge digital technology to tell a tale ning many decades.The film has won some limited criticism for the scant airtime offered to its female stars, most notably Anna Paquin, who plays De Niro’s adult daughter and speaks six words in her 10 minutes on screen.Speaking to USA Today, De Niro defended the decision of screenwriter Steven Zaillian, saying that such silence was part of the point of the character.“She was very powerful and that’s what it was,” De Niro said. “Maybe in other scenes there could’ve been some interaction between Frank and her possibly, but that’s how it was done. She’s terrific and it resonates.”Other backlash to the film largely stems from superhero movie fans angered by Scorsese’s dismissal of the genre. Speaking at the Tallinn Black Nights film festival in Estonia at the weekend, Dante Spinotti, a cinematographer who worked on films including Marvel’s Ant-Man and the Wasp, said: “I think probably Scorsese wasn’t thinking correctly when he said what he said.“I ide movie-making into two large categories: good movies and bad movies. That’s all there is to it. Why say what’s a movie and isn’t a movie? I don’t see the point.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed525ad945c4790116cf98246f45e3162ad75257/0_1151_8015_4810/master/8015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c38225a58997ecf5007c56213ed8639","title":"rachel roddys recipe for italys traditional christmas fruit cake panforte","story":"Try this Sienese ‘strong bread’, packed with dried fruit and spice, as an alternative to Christmas cakeThey arrived last week: the top of the fridge in the bakery at the bottom of my building now has a cardboard box crown, half containing pandoro, the other half panettone. “They are the long-life ones,” Angela behind the cash desk reminds me, before unwrapping a sweet: “They will last until next June.”“I might be dead by June!” says a lady paying for a packet of chickpeas. “Well, you should wait and buy one of the ones we bake in December,” Angela laughed. “They won’t last until June, and they are better for it.” A panettone has been as much a part of our English family Christmas as heavily injected fruit cake since the middle of the 80s. A puffed-up Italian cake you can tear is how I first remember it, picking and stripping the bits left behind on the paper. At some point, it became our Christmas Day breakfast cake, a habit that has remained: mouthfuls eaten in between opening presents, the panettone wrapper getting tangled up with the wrapping paper and dressing-gown belts. It is now my job to bring a panettone (or three) back with me from Rome, which means they are inevitably a bit squashed. I am loyal to the bakery at the bottom of our building and their chestnut-topped, classic panettone. Also, because I don’t plan to die before June, I buy a long-life one to put in the cupboard, which I eat for breakfast for a week in March.Our treat this year is going to be a panettone from Mammamassaia in Abruzzo, made with the best ingredients by traditional methods, then allowed a long rise and 100-day aging: these panettone begin life in October to be ready for Christmas. The label suggests leaving them somewhere warm for a few hours – near a fire or warm cooker – before cutting them with a serrated knife. As well as for breakfast, I like panettone for Boxing Day supper, warmed in the oven for a few minutes, then served Anna del Conte-style with a fat blob of mascarpone that melts obligingly.Having bought the panettone, I am going to make panforte: a strong bread that doesn’t so much make me think of bread as nougat crossed with a heavily spiced, dense fruit cake. Classic Sienese recipes, or at least those not shrouded in secrecy, call for 300g candied orange and lemon. I use a third of that, so 100g candied fruit and then 200g dried, pitted figs and prunes.Thanks to the honey, spices and the resilient nature of dried fruit and nuts, panforte will last as long as the box crown on top of the fridge, but is best after two weeks. Keep in a tin and, just before serving, dust generously with more icing, before cutting into strong slices.200g honey250g caster sugar300g mix candied orange, citron, pitted dates, prunes or sultanas250g roasted almonds or hazelnuts, or a mix of the two100g plain flour½ tsp ground cinnamon½ tsp ground cloves½ tsp ground nutmegIcing sugar, to dustLine the base and sides of a 20cm cake tin with baking paper.

The semi-final against Barcelona had not been played but Jürgen Klopp’s assistant was already contemplating the ideal preparation. He thought about inviting a team who could mimic Ajax’s or Tottenham’s style, to give Liverpool an idea of what they could expect if they overcame Barça.The location was decided. Marbella’s weather was similar to Madrid’s and it would be relatively easy to fly a team there secretly. “I really wanted to organise a game because otherwise it would have been three weeks without any competitive action,” Lijnders says. “I wanted us to play a similar team to the opponents we could face in Madrid. The idea was to privately invite a team to train three to four days in the way we wanted them to play us in the friendly.”Lijnders’ efforts proved well worth it after Liverpool overcame a 3-0 deficit to reach the final. “Benfica B came over and everything remained secret,” Lijnders says. “We gave a presentation to their manager about how they had to play. It had to be like Tottenham, with their set pieces, footballing intentions and defensive organisation. We played that game behind closed doors. We even built higher shields so no one could see anything. The match took place exactly one week before the final and we prepared everything like we would do during the day of the final.”Liverpool, who defeated Benfica B 3-0, secured the Champions League by beating Spurs 2-0. When watching the buildup to the early goals in both those games there is a recognisable pattern, with Liverpool winning possession on the halfway line and playing a long ball to Sadio Mané. “In both moments you could clearly see how we positioned ourselves to be able to dominate the second-ball game and directly searched for Sadio into the free space behind the last line.”“Together we decide what kind of aspects we want to develop for the team and then I create the exercises. It’s quite simple it’s just about the continuing stimulation of our mentality to conquer the ball as quick and as high up the pitch as possible. That element comes back in every exercise. We as staff always try to find ways so the players can be more spontaneous and more creative.”The high counterpressing has become the identity of the modern Liverpool. Lijnders works to refine its model and creates exercises which help players master the system. For example, in training a rule can be that a goal counts only when all the players have crossed the halfway line. “Purely to stimulate the team to push up quickly and be ready to counterpress counterpressing is only possible when you are together at all times. People say Liverpool are good at this or at that but I always say the main thing we are good at is that we are always together.”Lijnders explains there are a lot of formats. “Let’s take the five-v-two rondo, which in fact is a pressing rondo. Our game is about movement and speed, and with only five players those five have to run non-stop. The two guys in the middle are encouraged to make an interception within the first six passes. If they succeed, they can go out both at the same time, otherwise only the player who intervened is allowed to leave the middle. This all stimulates our counterpressing vision where we try to disrupt the buildup of the opponent inside their first few touches.”Lijnders explains how they often continue a session with other rondo-esque exercises, such as two teams of three competing against one team of three, until the latter wins the ball and replaces the team who lost the ball. That exercise is about instant transition and not dwelling on disappointment after losing possession.Lijnders argues those drills help shape Liverpool’s identity. “The players first have to understand the importance of counterpressing to our team. They have to feel it, not with the head, but with the heart. They start the exercise with the idea to keep the ball, but in the event of losing it they have to be directly on top of things.“When a team lose the ball in training, you will hear me, Jürgen or Pete screaming: ‘Go! Get it back! Don’t stop!’ It’s so loud they’ll even hear that in Manchester, haha. They have to understand why it’s so important. That power and emotion is our game. Because our identity is intensity. That comes back in every drill. And that’s what I like about coaching: that you can stimulate certain common behaviour and create a lot by specific team training. That’s what I live for.”Lijnders is only 36 but has been coaching for years. At 17 he was forced to quit playing after sustaining a serious knee injury. He quickly moved into coaching and after starting at the amateur side SVEB in the Netherlands he moved to PSV as a youth coach. In 2007 he went to Porto to become their academy’s head of inidual development and coached the youth team. After a few seasons Manchester United were keen to take him but that failed to materialise when Sir Alex Ferguson retired and Lijnders joined Liverpool in 2014, with responsibility for the Under-15s and Under-16s. A year later he was promoted to the first team by Brendan Rodgers.Lijnders says he is often inspired by the players when creating exercises. “The five-v-two rondo is a good example. It’s actually called Milly’s rondo now, after I got inspired by James Milner, because he always intercepted the ball within the first few passes. He was really quick and brought the focus of the rondo to another level. I was like: ‘How can I come up with a rule that everyone will execute with his kind of intensity?’ So I gave an extra incentive for the two players in the middle if they would intervene within the first six passes. So I told Milly: ‘This is your idea!’ The other players loved it.”“Jürgen does really care about the squad and his staff. Players will understand and absorb more of our philosophy when they feel how much we care about them.”The philosophy is about playing football in its most attacking shape. “We always focus on ourselves, attack the opponent with – but especially without – the ball a chasing attitude over 95 minutes.In his first season at Liverpool Lijnders was occasionally invited to Melwood by Rodgers to talk about counterpressing and Lijnders’ interpretation of 3-4-3. Lijnders impressed Rodgers with his tactical insights and accepted an offer to join the first-team staff but stayed connected to the academy, where he had created a group in which the best players from different age groups were brought together. One player to emerge from this pool was Trent Alexander-Arnold.Rodgers left shortly after promoting Lijnders but Klopp kept the Dutchman as first-team coach. They appeared to complement each other, so the manager was sad to see Lijnders leave in January 2018 for a managerial role at NEC in the Netherlands. So upset, in fact, that he swiftly offered Lijnders the chance to return as his assistant.“He was convinced we could conquer a lot together,” says Lijnders, who accepted Klopp’s offer and left NEC after half a season at the end of which the team lost in the promotion play-offs. “Jürgen can touch someone straight to the heart. He knows exactly what he wants and when we were on the phone it felt just right.”Since then Liverpool have become even better, with an increased tactical flexibility and intensity. Lijnders picks out another Klopp strength: “He is able to give a completely different perception to a situation inside a few minutes.” Lijnders gives an example of the game at Barcelona last season. “We lost 3-0, but afterwards Jürgen said in the dressing room: ‘The only team in the world who can overturn this defeat against Barcelona is us.’ It gave the squad a boost, also because of the way we had played that night. When the players walked towards the coach there was already a different feeling.”Lijnders’ bond with Klopp goes beyond a professional relationship. Occasionally they meet at their homes but most of the time they are at Melwood, where they spend even their down-time together.A glass cage adjacent to the Melwood building was specially built for Klopp and Lijnders to house a paddle tennis court. “It’s a combination of tennis and squash and because of the glass walls the ball can bounce, which keeps it in play,” Lijnders says. “The court is actually meant for two v two, so it’s not only a battle against each other, but also yourself.”The initial idea was to build a court beside one of their houses, at a time when they lived close to each other, but a court at the club made more sense. “It’s fantastic. Perhaps we play two to three times a week, sometimes more often.”In everything Lijnders does preparation is key. He has learned the smallest details can make the biggest difference. On the day of the return leg against Barcelona he sent a message via club staff instructing the ball boys to throw back balls as quickly as possible. “They can make a difference tonight, we need everyone on the top of their toes,” Lijnders wrote in his message.The decisive fourth goal came after Alexander-Arnold received the ball very quickly from a ball boy to take a corner which Divock Origi slotted home. So the final became a reality and enabled Lijnders to continue working on his preparations for Madrid. And there, after 21 seconds, he realised that those early investments had paid off. The puzzle was complete."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0bea0a99b4bba0e007335d72ceaf5c49998fc94/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63479d2edd2ae113af5098df749558aa","title":"womens super league talking points from the weekends action","story":"Arsenal were right to be ruthless, Liverpool are on their way to relegation and Man City need a marquee signingJust the six goals for Vivianne Miedema – and four assists – in Arsenal’s 11-1 win over Bristol City. Every one of the first 10 goals was either scored or created by the Dutch international, who broke the record for the number of goals scored in a WSL season last year – in fact, she broke it by January – and with 10 to her name already in this campaign I wouldn’t bet against her beating that tally of 22. At the moment Arsenal and Manchester City are going toe to toe at the top of the table, with Chelsea just behind, and it may well be that goal difference is vital – it’s all that separates the Gunners from City at the moment. It is absolutely key, then, to be ruthless, but all the same Arsenal’s mentality, scoring five goals in the first half against Bristol City and then bettering that total after the break, is impressive. After a quarter of an hour they were two goals up and they scented blood. Joe Montemurro will have drilled into them the fact that the league might be decided on the finest of margins, and when you get that chance you’ve got to be relentless.There is no disgrace in losing 1-0 to Manchester City, but Liverpool have now lost five of their eight WSL games by the same scoreline, and it’s starting to get really worrying. How many times does that have to happen before you decide you need a different approach? At the other end in those eight games, Liverpool have only scored one goal. At what point do they open up and start playing more attacking football? They’ve got players like Jess Clarke, who has been struggling with injuries but is an attacker with real pace and quality. Clearly they desperately need a No 9 and an attacking midfielder who can run with the ball at her feet. It’s clear that their manager, Vicky Jepson, needs to change things up either in terms of tactics or personnel – if not, they’re going down.Until Sunday, Manchester United had never conceded more than one goal in a WSL game, so the 3-2 defeat at West Ham was a real blip. Having taken the lead through Lauren James with just 10 minutes to play they would have been confident of seeing the game out. It didn’t work out that way and what will hurt most of all is that they were architects of their own downfall. In the last minute Mary Earps rolled the ball out short, West Ham pressed high, won the ball back and United then conceded a free-kick from which Katharina Baunach scored the winner. As a former goalkeeper myself, I thought United’s decision to play out from the back was criminal. West Ham, though, emerge with great credit: they brought in a lot of new faces over the summer and gelling them as a team looked a really difficult prospect, but they are growing under Matt Beard, and their link-up play is getting better and better. In Baunach and Kenza Dali they have a couple of set-piece specialists, and that gives them another way of winning games.You could also draw conclusions about Reading’s mentality from their performance at Brighton. Last week, after they came back from going two goals and a player down to beat West Ham, I suggested that they seem to need to go behind before they really kick into gear, and this was more evidence. They scored the first goal after 15 minutes, but conceded an equaliser within three minutes and were 2-1 down by half-time before coming back to equalise with the last kick of the game. It must be so frustrating for the manager, because their problem is nothing to do with technical or tactical ability, it’s just concentration. Reading have been a feared team in the WSL in the past, but I think their stock is slipping. The opposite is true of Brighton, who are consolidating and while they are not going to blow teams away, the south-coast club are also not going to get relegated.There are now just a few weeks until the mid-season transfer window opens, and with Chelsea making a huge statement of intent with the signing of Sam Kerr the question is how other teams are going to react. It’s a turning point for Chelsea and maybe for the WSL. Arsenal will feel their squad is good enough to win the title, and they might not add to it, but despite being second only on goal difference I think Manchester City need another landmark signing, either now or in the summer. Over the last couple of seasons they have lost key players without really replacing them, and with Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United improving all the time City are moving backwards. And then there’s Liverpool, who should want for nothing in terms of facilities or finance. Why aren’t they keeping up with the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea and City?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6fd5893d055f82301d5d642d50338bb8c95ba68/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2ae08046f2d961e7519588f8a5f9353","title":"premier league 10 talking points weekends action","story":"Chelsea toothless without Tammy Abraham, Everton better than results suggest and clever Jonjo Shelvey helps LiverpoolAfter a medley of mid-table finishes, could this be the season Crystal Palace return to the top half? They finished 10th four years ago under Alan Pardew and after victory at Burnley are part of a chasing pack on the tails of fifth-placed Tottenham. The win stopped a worrying rot of five games without victory and, with Wilfried Zaha having come to the fore in recent outings, there is plenty for a painfully inconsistent Palace to build on. December looks kind, too, with Bournemouth the visitors to Selhurst Park on Tuesday before matches against Watford, Brighton, Newcastle, West Ham and Southampton. After a quiet start Zaha, who has scored in successive games, is beginning to take centre stage, which is right where Palace need him. “He has been very good in recent games,” Roy Hodgson said. “We are grateful for the three points but now we need to use this feeling going forwards.” Ben Fisher Expect Tammy Abraham to walk straight back into the Chelsea team if he has recovered from a hip injury in time to face Aston Villa on Wednesday. They were clueless in attack during the home defeat by West Ham and badly missed Abraham’s mobility up front. Olivier Giroud started for the first time since August and a laboured performance from the striker could persuade Frank Lampard to sell him next month. However, Chelsea’s squad is not deep. Lampard made five changes after the draining draw with Valencia but it was a muddled display. Pedro, another who could be allowed to leave, struggled after being handed a rare start and it was surprising Michy Batshuayi stayed on the bench when Chelsea, who finished with the diminutive Christian Pulisic playing through the middle, were chasing an equaliser. Lampard needs Abraham back. Jacob Steinberg Whatever the future of Marco Silva, Everton are not a team bereft of talent. Djibril Sidibé, playing as a wing-back, supplied the excellent cross from which Richarlison scored a ing header of which Andy Gray and Graeme Sharp, the strike partnership of the club’s 1980s golden era, would have been proud. And the Brazilian goalscorer maintained his threat right up to the point Leicester stole the game with Kelechi Iheanacho’s late winner. Moise Kean’s brief cameo started with an improvised chip that had Kasper Schmeichel beaten and scrabbling. Alex Iwobi played a second-half crossfield pass of wonderful vision amid other flashes of creativity. James Maddison, Youri Tielemans and Harvey Barnes were kept unusually quiet by the midfield endeavour of Tom Davies and Gylfi Sigurdsson. Defeat, though, came when concentration dropped. John BrewinOld Trafford was treated to a familiar sight in the opening 10 minutes, as a spindly, cocksure attacking midfielder was kicked from pillar to post by brutish opponents before responding with a wondrous goal. Jack Grealish is no Cristiano Ronaldo but it says a fair bit about Manchester United’s last decade that they are now playing the role of hapless bruisers. As for the Aston Villa man, the fact he is the Premier League’s most fouled player – and by an astonishing distance – is a reflection of defenders’ inability to deal with him legally. The 24-year-old would be wise, though, to think twice when the heavyweights inevitably come calling. The opponents he played against on Sunday, who included Juan Mata, Fred and Luke Shaw, offer all the evidence he needs about the power of a big move to derail a decent career. Alex HessBefore kick-off a plane flew over St James’ Park trailing a banner urging everyone to Vote Brexit Party and, perhaps warming to the election theme, Pep Guardiola’s post-match message was similarly unconvincing. “We played so good,” said City’s manager, applying the sort of spin capable of making even a politician blush. In reality his side were always vulnerable to Newcastle’s counterattacking pace and had no excuses when the former Liverpool midfielder Jonjo Shelvey quite possibly handed his old club the title after being left unmarked as Christian Atsu shaped to take a late free-kick before pulling the ball back for Shelvey to equalise. “I’d love to say it was due to wonderful training-ground coaching,” Steve Bruce said, “but Jonjo saw City had nobody on the edge of the box, which is very rare for teams these days, and had a word with Christian.” Louise TaylorTalking about VAR: fine. A bit tedious but sadly unavoidable. Arguing about VAR: regrettable but perhaps an inevitable corollary of a botched law and an increasingly heated public discourse. In these ided times can we at least agree that singing about VAR should be beyond the pale? Norwich and Arsenal fans were the latest ones at it on Sunday. After the technology first awarded Arsenal a penalty, and then awarded Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang a second go at it because of Norwich encroachment, the indignant Norwich fans struck up an indignant chant of “Fuck VAR” – the protest anthem Joan Baez never wrote. Not to be outdone, the Arsenal fans started merrily singing their praise of the new technology. This is football in 2019: rival fans engaging in VAR-themed call-and-response opera, like a doomsday Gilbert and Sullivan. Jonathan LiewVictory over Watford has eased the pressure on Southampton before Norwich visit St Mary’s on Wednesday but it would be foolish for Ralph Hasenhüttl’s side to get carried away. Hasenhüttl said Saturday was not the time to berate his players’ worrying first-half performance but if his side can replicate the kind of urgency they displayed in the later stages of their first home win since April then they will give themselves a fighting chance. Norwich will take plenty of heart from an enthralling draw against Arsenal on Sunday and Saints could do worse than take inspiration from the way Daniel Farke’s side attacked on home soil. Too often Southampton shrivelled into their shell before Sofiane Boufal and Shane Long injected life into a desperate display. Against a playful and fearless Norwich they cannot afford to make the same mistake. Ben FisherIt has been suggested Moussa Sissoko is José Mourinho’s type of player. He has the physicality and athleticism the manager values and is capable of making an effective defensive contribution from the right-hand side of midfield. That may be true but Sissoko would surely not be in Mourinho’s team if he did not think he could trust him. He led the Tottenham team in interceptions (and fouls) against Bournemouth and buzzed around constantly in support of the right-back Serge Aurier. Sissoko was reliable and read the game well. It is surely this improved aspect of the 30-year old’s performance that will have endeared him most to Mourinho. Sissoko’s sweetly taken goal was a sign of a man playing with confidence and – for someone whose strife in front of goal has become legendary – a pleasure to watch. Paul MacInnesIf Chris Wilder’s Sheffield United are largely a triumph of coaching (four of Sunday’s back five played on their last trip to Molineux in the Championship) then the rampant form of Lys Mousset is proof the manager is no fool in the transfer market either. After three deeply unremarkable seasons at Bournemouth, Mousset was not many people’s idea of a sparkling goalscorer but Wilder saw something in him and, having parted with the relative pittance of £10m, can feel fully vindicated. The forward has already found the net more times in 13 games for his new club than he did in 71 at Bournemouth. Pound for pound, Mousset is the signing of the season so far – although it says plenty about the grotesque wealth of the Premier League that its bargain-basement castoffs are now selling for eight-figure sums.

It can be very limiting for sufferers as it can cause embarrassment and discomfort. Noticeable symptoms include yellow or brown discolouration of the nail that will not go away on its own, while crumbly nails can break off. A musty smell can occur, too.If the infection spreads to the area between toes, it is commonly called athlete’s foot, a condition that is contagious and easily spread by walking barefoot.There are simple precautions you can take to prevent getting an infection or passing one on. These include wearing socks when you try on shoes in shops, and wearing pool shoes or flip-flops up to the edge of a swimming pool and in the changing rooms and shower at the gym. Most importantly, dry your feet thoroughly after bathing, including between the toes to prevent soggy skin. And don’t share towels with your family members. If you do have an infection, use a separate towel for your feet to stop it spreading.Nail fungus is usually easiest to treat when it hasn’t gone to the root of the nail. Over-the-counter medicated treatments are usually only licensed to be used on infections that are in the top half of the nail. Many of the products sold for fungal nails are not actually medicated, but instead provide a preventative barrier for healthy nails against fungus or alter an infected nail to cause an improvement in its appearance, but do not actually kill the spores.

I had good reason to think this way. My grandmother had an awkward relationship with her mother, just as my mother endured a difficult relationship with her. My parents were spectacularly mismatched but stayed married – against my grandparents’ gloomy predictions – for a full 10 years before going their separate ways. After they split, my relationship with my younger brother dutifully headed in a similar direction: eternal enmity. We grew stealthily into polar opposites and our adolescent issues didn’t mellow with age. The last we saw of one another was at our mother’s funeral, 20 years ago.Hardly surprising, then, that I never much wanted to start a family myself, convinced that I wasn’t up to it. An absent father does not prime you for becoming an engaged one.When my future wife told me, on our third date, that she didn’t want children, I almost married her on the spot. But after a dozen years together, biology, circumstance and lingering whim conspired to change her opinion, and she then worked diligently to change mine, patiently explaining that I didn’t have to perpetuate the circle of familial dysfunction together, we could change it, and make ours better. Her reasoning was entirely sound. Ours was a happy union – my grandparents approved – and she had a confidence in me that I didn’t quite yet possess myself.And so, in early 2004, we took the plunge and threw ourselves open to fate. A mere 13 months later, one week shy of a doctor’s appointment to test the increasing probability that I was firing blanks, a blue line appeared where there had previously been none. I was thrilled, and relieved. I was also absolutely terrified. I remained twitchy throughout the pregnancy, fearful a baby would expose in me a pair of great clunking achilles heels. I read books on the subject – not hectoring self-help titles but, rather, brave, unflinching memoirs from writers such as Anne Enright and Rachel Cusk, whose combined message, as I interpreted it, was that I was right to panic.The learning curve, when it came, was bewildering. Such ruction from so small a person such flagrant disregard for bedtime. There were tears from each of us, but gradually I learned that fearing something so much actually prepares you for it all the more. It builds confidence, an inner steel, and once that’s established you become, if not quite adept, then at least increasingly fit for purpose. Cusk was right: it changes everything, but not necessarily for the worse. Starting a family didn’t drive us apart it knitted us together. And, thus emboldened, we repeated the process two years later. Somewhere in the middle of all that, we got married, because why not?My daughters are now 13 and 11. They have brought noise and chaos into our lives – the kitchen hasn’t been properly clean in a decade, and I can never find my keys – but I marvel at their existence, and the fact that I haven’t yet made a mess of things. I didn’t run away, and they don’t hate one another. We are an actual, functioning unit. We’re good.My working day is generally interrupted each afternoon at 3pm. Successive, post-school texts arrive, asking if they can bring friends round, if they can stay out, whether there are any prawn cocktail crisps left. An hour later, they’re home, the younger one demanding immediate access to my computer in order to watch YouTube the older one accusing me of finishing the Nutella. They hog my wife when she gets back from work, then conspicuously give us both a wide berth in pursuit of their own respective screen time, bedroom doors firmly closed, do not disturb, enter at your own risk.I can still see why I thought having a family seemed so unsettling. Ever since their arrival, life has become comprehensively more complicated, more convoluted and far more expensive. The house is crowded with competing opinions, raised voices and withering teenage sarcasm. They confuse me, exasperate me, make me laugh and, occasionally, particularly on birthdays when they write cards with their careful handwriting, make me cry. They are utterly self-obsessed and astonishingly lovely. They ask so many questions and never like the answer. I couldn’t imagine my world without them. Families, I’ve come to learn, don’t have to be knotty and dysfunctional but can actually be a harmonious place in which to dwell – a realisation that has brought comfort and relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5364dd8d83f816cd260e72fdaabfd654d888fb79/0_280_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0514eb549620b43f1515f4f0458c7852","title":"five ways to improve your commute","story":"David Spencer, professor of economics and political economy at the University of Leeds, has crunched the data on working on the commute and generally advises against it, saying any time or effort savings are likely to be illusory. “The encroachment of work into commute time simply extends the length of the working day, for no extra pay,” he says. “If we are to use commute time as work time, a radical step then would be to shorten the working day.”Our greatest struggle in commuting is the lack of control, says Kiron Chatterjee, associate professor in travel behaviour at the University of the West of England, Bristol. “Test out options for dealing with unpredictable events such as alternative methods of getting to work on particular days,” he says. “Empower yourself with options and flexibility.” Taking the fastest option is not always the best. A 2017 study by Chatterjee’s team, Commuting and Wellbeing, found that longer rail commutes, where you’re more likely to get a seat and be more comfortable and relaxed, were unsurprisingly associated with less stress than short rail journeys.On average, says Chatterjee, “commute satisfaction is much higher among walkers and cyclists”. His 2017 report found that active commuters didn’t feel robbed of leisure time to the extent that others do, implying they view it as a beneficial use of time, getting exercise and relaxation. But researchers at the University of Surrey warned this year that pollution spikes in the evenings, and therefore advised taking more leisurely, back street routes home.Your commute time might be better spent, says Chatterjee, “doing something relaxing such as mindfulness, to be calm before and after work”. If you’re not yet ready for meditating in public, arm yourself with a good audiobook or podcast.Commuters are in a state of denial when it comes to their need for human connection. We may hide behind our phones and avoid eye contact at all costs, but chatting to a stranger would make us happier. Take the 2014 study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, with the title, Mistakenly Seeking Solitude. The 200 train commuters who took part insisted that their ideal commutes would be spent in solitude. The researchers then split the self-styled loners into three groups. The first rode on their own, the second were told to connect with another commuter, while the third group just commuted in their regular way. Who ended up having the most positive commute? Those who had had a nice chat whether they’d been told to or it just happened naturally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d39d2bfaf5c09d6d1d262af432d55779f26f8db3/19_65_4795_2877/master/4795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39410d25fcccceb5aa6836bab5d9a886","title":"the hollywood christmas parade 2019 in pictures","story":"The Hollywood Christmas Parade is an annual event held along Hollywood Boulevard on the Sunday after Thanksgiving Day.

If they’re not, no, you can’t because a child under 18 can’t own land or property in the UK. But assuming it is a possibility, whether you should go ahead with selling your flat to them at a discount price is quite another matter.Selling your flat to your children for the price you paid for it doesn’t reduce any potential capital gains tax (CGT) bill because, for tax purposes, the gain (or loss) you make on disposal of the flat is taken to be the difference between its market value and the price you paid for it even if you sell for less that market value. The difference between the price your children pay and its true value also counts as a gift for the purposes of inheritance tax. However, if you’re still alive seven years after making the gift, it loses its liability to inheritance tax.If your children already own their own homes, as well as not qualifying for first-time buyer relief, they would also have to pay the higher rate of SDLT – which is the standard rate plus three percentage points – on the purchase of your flat.Whatever their current ownership status, they should be aware that they will be liable to CGT when they come to sell your flat (assuming they did buy it). There wouldn’t be a CGT bill on selling a property which they had lived in as their main home.As for the pitfalls of joint ownership as siblings, you are better placed to identify potential problems than I am.

The industrious rapper from Peckham – AKA Nathaniel Thompson – kicked off 2019 by releasing his fifth album, Big Bad, a sprawling 18-track field study of urban life and strife delivered in his distinctive, unhurried and often seismic baritone. Featuring guest spots from local fixtures (Labrinth, Wretch 32) and US imports (Lil Yachty, Swizz Beatz), it confirmed the 36-year-old’s status as UK rap’s self-assured kingpin.In April, Giggs joined his admiring collaborator Drake on stage at one of the latter’s O2 extravaganzas this current tour will conclude with his own headline show at Wembley Arena. On a subzero night in Glasgow, it is a relatively stripped-back experience: just Giggs prowling back and forth in a black T-shirt, trackie bottoms and an eye-catching gold medallion that would not look out of place in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Despite the venue’s toweringly high roof, the packed room thrums with the energy of a basement club night.An early highlight is Terminator, a martial advance of regal fanfares and dense drum fills, featuring doomy warnings to would-be rivals looking to move up the food chain. It sets a rolling, relentless tone as Giggs daisy-chains tracks together, with only the occasional pit stop to address the crowd and sip what looks like a pint of Guinness. “This is the exercise segment!” he shouts cheerily as the beats crank up.Grime MC JME makes an unexpected guest appearance for the strident 2015 track Man Don’t Care, perhaps the prickliest song ever to mention digestive biscuits. On newer track Baby, Giggs is more playful, test-driving chat-up lines over an addictive bass hook. There is a noticeable audience leap at the opening bars of KMT, his collaboration with Drake – while the crowd loyally echo that hit’s sporadic “OK, OK” refrain, they are also word-perfect on Lock Doh, Giggs’s sonically sparse but lyrically saucy ode to abundant romance. It is the stealthy standout in a crammed, rambunctious hour, and its theme of being in-demand suits him well.• At O2 Victoria Warehouse, Manchester, on 3 December.

Twice, on consecutive nights – on the first two dates of their On the Road Again world tour. Once was for work, to review the show. The other was for the sheer, heady, sugar-rush pleasure.I was, I’ll admit, a little on the old side for a Directioner, even then. Most of the 45,000-odd crowd was much younger – not that that you would necessarily be able to tell from the saucy suggestions on their homemade signs. “I don’t want to draw attention to them,” Liam Payne had said fussily on stage.It was an on-brand comment for the then-21-year-old Payne, who, had the harried, slightly anxious energy of a father-of-four at Disneyland. And no wonder: it was clear, even to me, that Zayn Malik had checked out, barely bothering to conceal his rolling eyes. He would be gone within the month, marking the beginning of the end (or “indefinite hiatus”) for the biggest boy band in the world.“It was a point where every day, you didn’t know whether it was going to be the end,” says Payne, sitting in the offices of his PR company in central London. “It was so touch and go, at every single show. I was slowly losing the plot.”Now 26 and almost totally tattooed, Payne has a new album on which he raps about getting rowdy on Bacardi and being “free” from 1D. At the same time his very-nearly-naked form is plastered on buses and train stations in a provocative ad campaign for Hugo Boss. Yet Payne is as polite and agreeable as if he were talking to his best friend’s mother. He is tired he says after an energetic early morning music video shoot. “There was a trampoline involved,” he says, sucking on his silver Juul. “It was hell – but it will look great.”Gym beast and sex symbol are relatively new tags. His role as the diplomat of the group was established from the time they were first assembled from five solo applicants on The X Factor in 2010.Payne auditioned when he was just 14, but was told by Simon Cowell to “come back in two years”. He did – and, eyes serious beneath his enormous fringe, blew the judges away with a brassy rendition of Cry Me a River.Growing up in Wolverhampton, he had been a talented cross-country runner – making the reserve list for the British Olympics team. But a fan of Usher, Justin Timberlake and Chris Brown, he was drawn to singing as “the thing that made my parents proudest”. His backup plan, had he not got through on X Factor, was to follow his father into an aircraft fitting factory.Once grouped in One Direction it took the five boys, then between 16 and 19, to pull together. “At the start we couldn’t get past our own egos,” says Payne. There would be fights over who got to sing what part, and even personal style. “Everybody had their own little thing – it was like having four older brothers.” Payne went on to write songs for the group, contributing to two-thirds of their 2014 album Four (arguably their best) and even earning a production credit on 2015’s Made in the AM. But in the early days he would be the one to sing the opening part because, he was told at the time, he “used to settle everybody”.Payne says he was a more experienced performer than the other boys, and a “bit more mature” – which he puts down to spending more time with his dad than his peers, and being so focused on a career in showbusiness. “I’d lived a different lifestyle from 14 to 16. Most kids try alcohol and experiment – I never did any of that because I thought there’s a chance that I might make it.”Management took advantage of this, he says, telling him his “very specific role” in the group was to keep the rest in line. “I was like, that’s great, innit – because then everyone in the band thinks I’m a dick.” He remembers one of the band’s first hotel stays. “We’ve got plates being thrown out the window, mattresses being ridden down the stairs, and I’m getting calls from the manager saying: ‘You need to sort it out’.”It wasn’t lost on the fans. Where Malik and Styles were the heartthrobs, Payne says he was classed as Mr Boring. “When you’re at the stadium, and if you get the least screams, it’s like: ‘For fuck’s sake.’” After a year playing 1D-Dad he gave up and learned to have fun. “If you can’t beat them, join them” – at which point, he notes wryly, the band’s public image became more cheeky and carefree. “And the more fun we had, the more successful it got.”He recalls performing to sold-out stadiums night after night, seeing “hundreds” of iPhones being thrown onstage in the vain hopes of their being returned with a selfie. “It’s like the kids just lost their minds.”“There were parts of it that were a bit shit, like there is with anything,” he says, “and there were parts of it that was just euphoria.”He recalls seeing 15,000 fans camped outside his hotel room in Lima, Peru. Security had advised them to stay inside all day, and because “they were the adults, we thought they were in charge. Then over time we started to figure out that they weren’t, and that’s when we used to run off.”Yet the adrenaline peaks of performing, followed by long troughs of tedium, were akin to a drug addiction, says Payne. He turned to alcohol. “Doing a show to however many thousands of people, then being stuck by yourself in a country where you can’t go out anywhere – what else are you going to do? The minibar is always there. ”For a time, he was also taking an epilepsy drug as a mood stabiliser that he says affected his cognitive functioning under certain lights. Payne says he had been well advised to take it, to counter the “erratic highs and lows” he was experiencing – “I just needed a little bit of help to keep me stable” – “but under certain lights on stage or during interviews, I wouldn’t be able to tell them my name”.He is not inclined to discuss this today, “because it’s a bit dark,” he says, a touch brusquely – “but yeah, it was very touch and go at times”. This was both in 1D and afterwards, he clarifies. As One Direction got bigger and bigger, he says, “I was like: ‘I don’t really know how to deal with this’. Once you start, you can’t really press the stop button.”The “indefinite hiatus” button, though, was easier – in mid-2015, four months after Malik’s departure, the band made the decision together. “It was a little bit dark and twisted towards the end of it,” says Payne, “but the last few shows were really beautiful moments because the pressure cooker had been let off.“It was almost like counting down to holiday – we were going to wake up that Monday morning with no schedule.” Afterwards Payne was in therapy for two years, and took six months off. “It was difficult at the start, because I didn’t really know anything about myself. It was a bit of a numb feeling.” In early 2016, he started dating Cheryl Cole, 10 years his senior, and one of the X Factor judges to be wowed by his audition. He is vague about whether he thought coverage of the age gap in their relationship was sexist (“For me it’s like, you love who you love”), though he notes that the online rumour mill is now trying to claim his new girlfriend – 19-year-old model Maya Henry, whose face in close-up is his iPhone wallpaper – is younger than she is.His son with Cole, Bear, will turn three in March. Payne had always wanted to be a young dad, but says he struggled at first. “I built it up so much in my head. Finding your feet in that relationship between child and father – it’s difficult.”He contributed by cooking. “Cheryl was always really glued to Bear, so for me, I was like: ‘What’s my role in this? If I cook and look after her, then in turn I’m looking after him’ – that made sense to me.”The couple publicly confirmed their split in July 2018, but continue to co-parent. Lately Payne’s schedule has taken him away for weeks at a time, which is “always difficult”, especially now Bear is old enough to notice. “But he’s good at using the phone and FaceTime.”That schedule is about to get busier, with Payne’s debut album as a solo artist finally out this Friday. Laden with chart-friendly trop house, trap and Latin pop influences, LP 1 plays like a water cannon aimed at commercial radio – there is even a Christmas song.It has been a long lead-up: the first single, Strip That Down, was released nearly two years ago and established Payne as the 1D member most influenced by contemporary hip-hop – perhaps too much so. A picture he posted to Instagram of himself in February 2018 wearing a chain necklace, flipping the bird and bragging about travelling by private jet was quietly deleted following ridicule.Amid the success of Strip That Down, which was streamed over 1bn times, Payne was also still “struggling” with alcohol: “I just hid it very well.” He went on to spend an entire year sober – a necessary if boring step. “My social life completely plummeted. I always feel like you never get past the awkward first 10 minutes at a party, when everyone’s like: ‘Do we get up and dance, or do we just sit here?’ I don’t know whether it made me happier, but it was definitely needed.”His more recent stint of self-discipline was to prepare for his nude photo shoot with model Stella Maxwell for Hugo Boss. In the lead-up, he was in the gym between “five and eight times a week, sometimes twice a day” and eating mostly chicken and vegetables – with no carbohydrates after 2pm and nothing at all after 8pm. For the last “stripping” phase, he ate nothing but porridge and white fish for a month. “It was horrible – but it definitely works.”The shoot had been his idea, inspired by campaigns featuring David Beckham and Mark Wahlberg – Payne’s role models, whose cross-disciplinary celebrity shapes his own career goals. Last year he auditioned in front of Steven Spielberg for a part in next year’s West Side Story remake, and has been submitting audition tapes irregularly since. “It’s just trying to manage the time in between being a dad, a boyfriend, singer, model and whatever.”Between the trap beats, tighty-whities and tattoos is he attempting to put across a new, more grown-up image? “Oh yeah, definitely.”In One Direction, he was “Mr Vanilla – no one wanted to know a thing”. Then, with the “chain and rapper phase … I didn’t really know what I was aiming for, but it was actually exactly where we are right now. I just needed to find the right keys to make me feel like the man I wanted to be.”Which is, he jokes, is “like a really English Magic Mike”. Do you like being objectified, I ask? “I think it’s quite funny,” says Payne, clearly delighted.

She got one of the rare laughs from the audience as she icily cut into a question from Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, to Richard Burgon, the Labour representative, asking whether he thought a better deal could be negotiated than remaining in the EU. “No,” Sturgeon said. “No. There is no deal better than staying in the EU.”Burgon started off a bit hesitantly when attacked over Labour’s policy on sentencing and the party’s Brexit position, but he warmed up with a series of strong attacks on the Tories over their threat to the NHS. He also delivered a zinger against Nigel Farage when calling him out for demanding independence when there is “nothing independent about taking instruction from Donald Trump when he rings up LBC”.Price came into his own when he attacked Farage for his defence of Trump. He stated it was never acceptable for someone to boast of “grabbing women by the pussy” and said he was offended as a gay man by Boris Johnson’s comments about “bumboys in tank tops”. “Neither Trump or Boris Johnson are fit to be in public life,” he said.Swinson delivered the strongest opening statement, saying Johnson “can’t be bothered to talk to you tonight and is leaving it to his cheerleader”. She said the prime minister “picks on people weaker than himself” and stokes isions. However, her performance in the debate was somehow flatter than on Friday night, when she made a strong appearance on the BBC seven-way debate.Berry delivered a necessary message about tackling the climate emergency but she struggled to get airtime amid louder voices jostling for attention.Cheesy and wooden, Sunak did not make any major slip-ups but he struggled to cut through and his lines all sounded precooked. However, the Conservatives are likely to be relieved that he got through the two hours without incident while delivering the key campaign messages.The Brexit party leader had a clear run at attacking both the Conservatives and Labour for being “weak on sentencing”. He delivered populist lines about wanting to bang up terrorists for life, and blaming the “liberal elite” and “political correctness” for terrorists being released halfway through their sentences, without much direct challenge from the other parties. Farage has been delivering such rightwing stump speeches for decades and his confidence showed. But he came unstuck defending Trump, saying some of his sexist comments are the kind of thing men say “after a night out with a drink”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a626b61ab04234750c98bcf03940d4da70e8453/171_404_6281_3769/master/6281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c957ae249cda3dc73dcd922d9c8e24","title":"on road with jeremy corbyn a photo essay","story":"As the Labour leader fights his second general election,  photographer  Sean Smith joins the campaign trailI started photographing Jeremy Corbyn during the leadership contest before the 2015 election. After a short time covering him on the campaign trail, I thought he would do a lot better then people expected. By the time of the next general election, in 2017, I, probably in a minority of one, thought he could win.Corbyn is quite relaxed with a camera around. When we first met, he would ask: “What do you want? What should I do?” But now he understands I’m not trying to do photocall pictures I want it to be as if I wasn’t there.To start with I didn’t have much special access, but over time I persistently asked to follow him. I don’t think the Labour team ever started to trust me, but they did start to tolerate me.I wasn’t expecting him to do the Eric Morecambe pose. I didn’t suggest it. A member of the public asked to do one with him and then he got Lizzi to do one, too. It was very spontaneous.Corbyn is much more relaxed and open than his minders from the press team. He said to me once, “Oh Sean, are you coming on the train with me?” and suddenly all of his people looked worried I could see them thinking, “Oh no, don’t invite him – what are you doing?”He seems very happy and rejuvenated when he’s on the road and appears to prefer it to being in Westminster: I think he feels it’s a bit of a club, an echo chamber. On the road, he seems genuinely engaged, albeit mostly with Labour party members. Perhaps he should go after a few Tories, too.He’s got more energy than I do. I was with him in Hartlepool one day, back in Islington the next: he couldn’t resist popping into a tiny local street festival where there was an Elvis impersonator. Everyone there wanted to say hello to him, even the police officers. When he’s preparing a speech, he does very brief notes to himself. It seems like he’s writing prompts. In Tolpuddle, he was making his notes in a porch behind the stage, where a musician had left a guitar.I think Corbyn is the only politician I’ve photographed who doesn’t have that lifelong ambition to be prime minister. I’ve never come across anyone like that. All the others, even if there is no possibility of it happening, have that occasional glint in their eye at the thought of “what if?”. For him, agree with him or not, it is all about the policies he deeply believes in it is not about personal ambition. I think even his enemies would agree with that.I think he’s a lot more steely and capable than people think. From the little work I’ve done with Boris Johnson, he’s more desperate to be loved than Corbyn the prime minister seems to get hurt if people don’t like him.It’s become harder to get proper time with politicians. Margaret Thatcher was a lot easier to photograph than Tony Blair or David Cameron. They want to stage-manage and control things. With these shots, I feel I got some of those rare candid moments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85ea2d700ca650d1b8045ead99d9c539d431be60/0_98_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4715abab3572891d62141f7aacc24a78","title":"island states want decisive action to prevent inundation","story":"Ahead of Madrid climate change conference António Guterrez says political will missing António Guterrez, the United Nations secretary general, contrasted the “leadership” and “mobilisation” shown by the world’s youth on the climate emergency with the lack of action by governments, which were failing to keep up with the urgency of the problem despite increasing signs that the climate was reaching breakdown.Before the start of a critical conference on the climate crisis on Monday, he said the world had the technical and economic means to halt climate chaos, but what was missing was political will.Guterrez called for further investment from rich countries and support for poor nations to make the changes needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of global heating. Amid rising temperatures, wildfires, heatwaves, droughts and floods, the danger signals were clear and must be acted on without further delay, he said.“In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments – particularly from the main emitters – to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.”He was joined in his call by the leaders and representatives of some of the world’s poorest countries, which are suffering most from climate change.The countries most at risk of deluge from climate chaos have issued an impassioned plea to the industrialised world ahead of crucial negotiations on the Paris agreement that start on Monday in Madrid.“Anything short of vastly greater commitment to emission reduction, a new climate finance goal and tangible support for disaster risk reduction will signal a willingness to accept catastrophe.”Pacific atolls and other low-lying islands are likely to be inundated if temperatures rise to more than 1.5C above preindustrial levels, while current Paris commitments put the world on track for a “disastrous” 3C.“We are mired in a planetary emergency of existential proportion,” said the leaders of the 44 states of AOSIS, in a joint statement. “The impacts are real and current for people living on small islands. This does not have to be our destiny or legacy.”While small islands are at greatest risk, rich countries were also suffering, said Clarence Samuel, lead negotiator for the Marshall Islands.“None of us are immune,” he said. “All month we have watched in horror as our Pacific cousins Australia have literally watched their country burn, fuelled by a climate crisis of our own making.”Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API\u0026nbspwarned\u0026nbspthe industry: “Time is running out.”Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.The Nasa scientist\u0026nbspJames Hansen testifies to the US Senate\u0026nbspthat “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A\u0026nbspconfidential report\u0026nbspprepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies\u0026nbspestablish\u0026nbspthe Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out\u0026nbspan ad in The New York Times\u0026nbsptitled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose\u0026nbspmain donors\u0026nbspare in the oil and gas industry,\u0026nbspleads\u0026nbspthe “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which\u0026nbspends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals\u0026nbsp90 companies\u0026nbspare responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each\u0026nbspdonate at least $500,000\u0026nbspfor the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the\u0026nbspbiggest threat\u0026nbspto the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.To fulfil the Paris goals, far tougher targets on emissions are needed, while this year’s negotiations – known as COP25, running from 2 December to 13 December – will focus on technical issues such as a mechanism for trading carbon within the Paris agreement.Resolving these technicalities will allow the UN to wrap up the Paris “rulebook”, setting out how to measure and achieve emissions cuts, but experts are concerned that it leaves too little time for the substantive question of targets, which under the rules must be resolved by the end of 2020.Under the 2015 Paris agreement, countries are supposed to set out more ambitious climate action in 2020, when current targets expire. Governments were given the five-year grace period to ratchet up their national goals.Some countries – including the UK – have put in place long-term goals of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, that leaves hanging the question of 2030 targets, which are needed to keep countries on track.Talks on the crucial matter of 2030 commitments will largely be relegated to informal meetings on the sidelines of COP25, though these are what will determine the success of the Paris agreement – and the future of the climate.There are also continuing tensions at the talks over funding to help developing economies curb emissions and cope with the consequences of climate disaster, and whether poor countries should be compensated by the rich for the loss and damage caused by global heating.Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: “The world’s small window of opportunity is closing rapidly. We must urgently deploy all the tools of multilateral cooperation to make COP25 the launchpad for more climate ambition to put the world on a transformational path towards low carbon and resilience.”The talks, taking place in Madrid after the original host nation, Chile, pulled out owing to its political crisis, will also be overshadowed by US president Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement.The US last month formally submitted the one year’s notice legally required for withdrawal under the accord. The withdrawal will formally take effect the day after the next US presidential election, and just before the next UN talks in November 2020, to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow.A US State Department spokesperson told the : “The US delegation at COP25 will actively engage in negotiations to protect US interests and level the playing field for US businesses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdcbf20aeded4179bda0e2ec5696de6d8e468509/0_80_1380_827/master/1380.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d66f7f253666ae4cf889da5bfa3c57b","title":"can you solve it smart as a box of frogs","story":"Slippery brainteasers and a Christmas challengeToday’s puzzles are taken from Mathigon, a wonderful interactive mathematical encyclopaedia.

If they cannot meet the difference they are at risk of eviction.Although ministers said last month the overall benefit freeze will end in April, it has emerged that housing benefit was not included in the announcement and a decision on this has been delayed for whoever forms the next government.Shelter’s chief executive, Polly Neate, said: “The freeze on housing benefit is pushing families into poverty and homelessness. People are being forced into desperate measures to pay their rent from selling their possessions and borrowing money to skipping meals.”Shelter cited the case of Carla Hinch-Worman of Peterborough who is bedbound with a degenerative disease and needs 24-hour care. She currently rents a two-bedroom bungalow with her husband and teenage son, but because of a £200 housing benefit shortfall she must top up the rent with cash from her disability allowance.The Shelter rent gap analysis was based on Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) data obtained through freedom of information requests. The data covers tenants in the private rented sector who have low levels of savings and are almost entirely dependent on benefits for their income.DWP spokesperson said: “Local housing allowance rates are intended to help ensure those in receipt of benefits face the same financial choices as those who do not receive welfare support. More than 360 local housing allowance rates have increased this year by targeting extra funding at low-income households. More than 58,000 households have moved out of the benefit cap due to starting a job, increasing their earnings or increasing their hours.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b38604170cec38f5e606b4dc9427776c43a41cbc/0_99_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2e53b8a1ffbcd18c35ff19bcbe034bf","title":"one stop shops needed for womens health services","story":"Women often required to visit multiple clinics for routine procedures, says reportOne-stop shops should open in the high street, where women can go to get contraception, screening services, menopause advice and help with other health needs, while the morning-after pill should be sold off the shelf without consultation, say leading UK experts.The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which has been working on a blueprint for women’s health services for more than a year in conjunction with other groups and government, says services for women need to be completely overhauled to give them far more control over their health.Its report launched today in the House of Commons, called Better for Women, says women with busy lives struggle to get the healthcare and advice they need. It sets out a strategy for reshaping the present fragmented NHS systems that require women to see different nurses and doctors in a variety of specialised clinics, as well as their GP practice, for procedures that should be routine.It’s not just special pleading for women, said Lesley Regan, president of the college. Many are carers and mothers and they influence the healthcare behaviours of everyone else. “If you get it right for women, you get it right for lots of other people,” she said.“Women are falling through the cracks of very basic services that should be very easy to prevent or access,” she said. “This is not rocket science. We are not suggesting an expensive new solution. We’re just saying we need to think about women across their life course because so many of the things that affect women, for which they need the NHS, are predictable.“We’re not delivering what women need where they need it,” she said. A smear test, contraception and an STI check could all be done by the same person in 15 minutes, she said. “But at the moment, girls and women are being pushed around from pillar to post because a nurse or the health practitioner or the GP that they visit hasn’t got the commission to actually do the other things as well.”Women should not have to go back to the GP for a new prescription for the pill every three months when it has been heavily researched for the last 60 years. “It’s far more dangerous to get pregnant than it is to be on the pill,” she said. Girls and women should be able to get the very safe progestogen-only pill from a pharmacist or online, the report says. The morning-after pill should be sold straight off the shelf without the need to speak to a doctor or pharmacist.The report says all young people should be educated from an early age about women’s health, and health issues such as the support during menopause should be embedded in workplace policies.The college says the changes would save money by enabling women to stay in better health. Sexual health experts from the faculty of sexual and reproductive healthcare and the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) voiced support.Gill Walton, chief executive of the RCM, backed its findings, including those on abortion, which she said should be regarded as just another medical procedure. “This is an important report that puts women at the centre of health improvement that needs governments and those running our health services to take notice. Our whole health service needs to focus much more on prevention of ill health, and to invest in our health and social services to support that,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6fc84459b1d8bdc91afdbf017b1ea34a2281555/123_59_4877_2926/master/4877.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fca50e79dccc5a3602d723e9e31649d","title":"englands joe root praises ollie popes maturity after second test stand","story":"Ollie Pope was praised for his maturity after Surrey’s 21-year-old prodigy, playing in the second Test as a wicketkeeper, struck his maiden half-century amid a bumper alliance with Joe Root.The right-hander made 75 from 202 balls, his first significant contribution in an England shirt since being thrust into the Test spotlight against India last year, in a No 4 position that was too high so early in his fledgling career.Chasing the ball proved his undoing during both those two Tests and the innings-defeat in Mount Maunganui. But here, at No 7 after replacing the injured Jos Buttler behind the stumps, he showed patience on a surface not conducive to fast scoring.Root, who put on 193 with Pope for the seventh wicket, said: “He played extremely well. You look at the way Ollie plays and has played for Surrey in county cricket he’s very free-flowing, someone that scores quite quickly and likes to put pressure on bowlers.“He showed a lot of maturity in the way he went about it. He knew that it was a crucial partnership between me and him and that we needed to make sure that we set the game up, and built up to a position where we could dictate terms and then try to force the issue towards the back end of that second session.“I thought he read the situation really well, showed great maturity and I’m really pleased for him to get a good contribution in this innings, and for us to go on and get a big score over 400 as well.”Root came close to running Pope out on 59 during his own dash to 200, the younger man forced to e for safety following a mix-up in communication as Tom Latham missed with a shy at the stumps.

A brilliant touchdown on Sunday proved thatIf this is not the best touchdown in NFL history, it is at least the most pleasing:I mean, come on now. What even is that? What that is in fact, is the Dolphins punter tossing a pass to the team’s kicker for a touchdown during Miami’s victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The Dolphins lined up in a slight variation of an unorthodox high-school and college-football play, known as the swinging gate. It’s typically used on point-after attempts, when a team puts two stacks of players on opposite sides of the field. The kicker stands in as quarterback, and if a receiver is uncovered outside, the quarterbackkicker flips the ball to him. If not, all those receivers and linemen return to the middle of the field and set up for a kick.And that’s what the Philadelphia Eagles were expecting on Sunday. But the Dolphins had other ideas. Instead, they used one of the smallest, least athletic players on their team as red meat – in this case, the punter – drawing out four defenders, while sneaking another small, unathletic player – in this case, kicker Jason Myers – into the end zone. The result? A touchdown that immediately entered the pantheon of top trick plays.Miami’s score is so wonderful, though, because it is unique. Usually trick plays in the NFL, like the infamous “Philly Special” from Super Bowl LII, are ones that have been run at lower levels of the sport forever. They just take on more prominence when someone has the guts to make the same call in the big leagues. But the Dolphins touchdown is all their own. Although the swinging gate is used at lower levels, it’s never been used before in this way in the pros.Miami were built to lose this year, in the hopes of grabbing a franchise changing player (or players) in next year’s draft. But Tankapalooza has been dealt a serious blow by the fact that they have a talented, creative coaching staff. Headed by Brian Flores and a stack of characters who used to work for the Bill Belichick brains trust in New England, the Dolphins staff have now cobbled together three wins – which is three more than many thought they would win all season. Flores has proved he has the right temperament for the job, and his tactical nous has never been in doubt.Winning the coach of the year award would be a step too far. What John Harbaugh has done in Baltimore will likely earn him the nod, and voters are unlikely to reward the Dolphins organization for attempting to punt on a season. But no other staff has had to deal with the same kind of restraints or public mockery as Miami’s. Flores is at least worthy of some consideration.“Free Pouncey” – a slogan on the Pittsburgh Steelers’ pre-game hoodies.The Steelers responded to Freddie Kitchens’ mid-week t-shirt snafu by donning some combative fashion designs of their own before their game against the Browns. And it was Pittsburgh who got the last laugh: the Steelers beat the most hyped Browns roster of the past decade despite playing with their third-string quarterback. Some organizations just stay lousy, regardless of the talent on the field.Lamar Jackson continues to dazzle on his way to a likely MVP nod. He was sensational in the first half against a frisky San Francisco defense on Sunday, before the 49ers figured some things out in the second half. If Sunday served as a Super Bowl preview, we are in for something special come February.Justin Tucker, kicker, Ravens Big truss. There is nobody in football as reliable as Tucker. With time dwindling in a tied, rain soaked Niners-Ravens game, John Harbaugh went against conventional wisdom. Rather than run an extra play in a bid to move the ball further down the field and make a game-winning field goal easier, Harbaugh let the clock tick down. He knew it didn’t matter. Tucker is money in the rain, sleet, snow or whatever concoction of all three was falling in Baltimore on Sunday. Tucker nailed the 49-yard field goal to give the Ravens the win and solidify their status as Super Bowl favorites. How good is Tucker? His field-goal was his 38th-straight successful attempt in the fourth quarter of games in his career.Derrick Henry has become the most consistent running back in the league. In his last 16 games, he’s rushed for 1,725 yards and 20 touchdowns, the first player to hit those marks since 2009. His Tennessee Titans are one of the NFL’s sneaky good teams. They run the ball well, are getting excellent production out of Ryan Tannehill, and do a great job of getting off the field on third down on defense. - Tom Brady had a bad game on Sunday, as his team went down 28-22 to the Houston Texans. Much of the blame for the Patriots’ offensive struggles this season has landed at the feet of the offensive line and the inability of the team’s receivers to create separation. But that wasn’t the case against Houston, when Brady missed a lot of easy throws. Opposing defenses have blitzed him relentlessly, and he’s caved, something that would have been unthinkable against the Brady of old, when being a one-man blitz-beater was his calling card. It’s not quite time for the end-of-dynasty talk yet, but it’s time to recognize the steady decline in Brady’s performance over the past 18 months.- Adam Vinatieri is a legend, but his late-career decline from pretty good to flat-out untrustworthy has cost the Colts a playoff spot this season. He had two field goals blocked on Sunday, the latest rough outing in a rough season. It’s a shame that the 46-year-old’s career is ending this way, but it’s as much on the Colts’ front office, who should have moved on from Vinatieri much earlier in the season, as on the player himself.- Giants quarterback Daniel Jones has now started 11 games in his rookie season. In that , he has thrown 11 interceptions and fumbled the ball 15 times, turning it over 21 times. Yikes.- The Jaguars benched Nick Foles in favor of Gardner Minshew after Foles had an awful first half against the Buccaneers. “I wanted to get a spark,” coach Doug Marrone said. “It was kind of dead, and I wanted to get things going and made the switch at quarterback.” That’s not what you want to hear about a guy to whom you’ve committed $50m.- According to Fox Sports’ Jay Glazer, general managers around the league are going back into their pre-draft reports to see which scouts said Lamar Jackson shouldn’t have been a quarterback.- With Andy Dalton reinserted into the line-up, the Bengals got their first win of the season, beating the Jets 22-6."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbdef08ca2c0f29ff4a4ace25fa02f946018586f/0_64_2191_1314/master/2191.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d463b38b07b4fa343ccdc61afd0f2031","title":"talking horses tote list shows lostintranslation is punters favourite","story":"“The most popular horse in training” is one of those conveniently unofficial titles that can (and almost certainly will) be applied to several different horses over the course of a racing year by various journalists and commentators, or even by the same one. Don’t bother Googling it, I’ll just plead guilty now to save time.But the return of the Tote’s Ten To Follow competition has provided at least one verifiable measure of which jumper really is the most popular around. There were just over 63,000 entries for the competition by last Saturday’s noon deadline, and the list of the top 20 horses, according to the percentage of lists in which they appear, makes for interesting reading.So, which horse is the one that most players want on their side? Cyrname, the top-rated chaser, perhaps? Or Altior, who was only just behind him at the end of his astonishing 19-race winning streak last month? Maybe it’s double Grand National winner Tiger Roll, or Paisley Park, the Stayers’ Hurdle winner who appeared as impregnable as ever on his comeback at Newbury on Friday.It would have been very difficult to imagine Colin Tizzard’s horse topping the list just a month ago, for all that his novice season over fences was hugely promising. A close second behind Defi Du Seuil at Cheltenham was followed by a Grade One win at Aintree, but it was his one-and-a-half length win in the Betfair Chase which propelled him to the front of the Gold Cup betting and made him a must-have for so many Ten To Follow stables.There’s no such thing as a quiet Monday at Plumpton, where Mystical Knight (2.30) has been supported in his attempt to keep up the good recent form of Anthony Honeyball’s yard. The veteran chaser has form figures of PP4P- but has shortened from the opening 8-1 to 11-2 at the time of writing.That must have something to do with a crashing handicap mark, which was 139 three years ago when he was tried in Listed company. But he lost his form, along with others at a troubled yard, and then didn’t join Honeyball at the best time last term.The stable’s runners are going much better this season and it will be no surprise if Mystical Knight can exploit a mark of 116 on this drop in class, for all that others in the field have recent winning form.Longhousesignora (1.30) is napped at 7-2 for the mares’ handicap hurdle. She’d have needed her October run and the drop back in trip was no help next time. This return to three miles, with cheekpieces on and the stable’s main rider back on board, can bring about improvement.Scrutinise (3.00) doesn’t need to improve much, having gone down by just a neck on his first start for Zoe Davison. He’s 100-30 in a weak race. Meanwhile, Jonjo O’Neill Jr has a live chance of a double as he attempts to get back on top of the conditionals title race, but both Bean In Trouble (12.30) and Adicci (2.00) look like being unbackably short."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2d6e42a9939ab13067ba8ad282d9510cd7032e3/0_120_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7900c10cd01dd430a1b6dac0dfa2954f","title":"anthony joshua saudi arabia","story":"Anthony Joshua’s fight in Saudi Arabia this week once more raises questions about the choice of venue for big eventsTwo scenes. Two British sporting icons. Variations on a theme. Scene one: a supremely jet-lagged Anthony Joshua in a Heathrow hotel in September. After several softballs about his rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr, the question finally comes. Why fight in Saudi Arabia when Amnesty International says the regime is using you to sportswash its “abysmal” human rights record that includes using public beheadings as a weapon to crush dissent?“I appreciate them voicing an opinion,” replies Joshua, before stressing he is not a superhero who can zap away the world’s problems by donning a cape. When pressed, he mumbles something about “reforms” and then suggests he can use his relationship with the Saudis to ask difficult questions rather than “just accusing, pointing fingers and shouting from Great Britain”.Scene two: Sebastian Coe in a sweaty press conference at the World Athletics Championships in Qatar a month later. Again human rights concerns are raised. But this time Lord Coe goes much further. Sport, he says, has a unique power to “shine the spotlight on issues” and is the “best diplomat we have”. “That is why sport will continue to work and sweat as hard as it does to make social change,” he continues, proselytising with the fervour of a true believer. “And organisations that are smart are actually partnering as they realise they can elicit that change.”It’s a seductive premise, isn’t it? Sport as a sort of human-rights Heineken, somehow able to refresh and open up countries that traditional statecraft can’t reach. The reality does not match the rhetoric. Professor Simon Chadwick of the Salford Business school, who specialises in the geo-politics and marketing of sport, is blunt. “It is difficult to identify a country anywhere in the world that has fundamentally and sustainably changed for the better as a result of sport,” he says. Chadwick accepts there have been small improvements in some Gulf states: women being allowed into football matches in Saudi Arabia and Iran, for instance. “But without other, broader policy measures, it won’t bring about a massive shift in attitudes and behaviours,” he warns.Even the small changes in workers’ rights for those working on 2022 football World Cup stadiums comes with a caveat. “These improvements are not necessarily being replicated in other industrial sectors across the country,” Chadwick says. “Qatar now has a twin-track labour market: one where standards are robust even by international standards and another where practices remain deeply suspect.” Nick McGeehan, a co-director of the human rights research organisation FairSquare Research \u0026amp Projects, is even more sceptical about sport’s power to improve human rights in repressive countries. “It’s a great line for sports administrators to trot out but the Gulf provides numerous examples of why the argument tends to be bogus and self-serving,” he says.He cites the UAE, which has gone further than most regimes in using sport, as well as arts and literature festivals, to boost its image in the west. “Proponents say this will create space for free expression and improve the rights climate,” he says. “It hasn’t. On the contrary, there has been a drastic decline in the human-rights situation.” McGeehan argues the presence of golf’s European Tour, Formula One and ATP Tennis, along with Abu Dhabi’s ownership of Manchester City, “have provided it with cover and enabled it to present itself as liberal, western-friendly and open for business – everything Saudi Arabia now wants to do”.Sport has extraordinary power to changes lives and challenge cultures. No one disputes that. It is helping people get more active, reducing violence between gangs, or even, or in the case of Football 4 Peace International, improving relations between Palestinian and Israeli children. But this sporting evangelism, which dates back at least as far as Thomas Hughes’ Christian socialism of the 19th century and is propagated most loudly by the International Olympic Committee and Fifa, can only stretch so far before it looks silly.Bringing Formula One to Bahrain has not made the country substantially more liberal. Saudi Arabia, according to Amnesty, is in the midst of a “human-rights crackdown” despite its modernisation claims. China has become more authoritarian since the world’s eyes fixed on it during the 2008 Olympics. And while those who work in sport appear to believe the good-news stories they tell themselves, Chadwick notes when events are taken to such countries they merely “induce micro-changes within cultures rather than fundamentally make societal and macro-cultural change”.Perhaps things will eventually shift. Chadwick notes there is often an internal feud between traditionalists and modernisers in Gulf states, with younger, western-educated elites more willing to embrace some reform. Whether such reforms would be enough for human rights groups is another matter. For now, though, we can say this with confidence. Holding sporting events in repressive regimes does far more to serve the political and economic interests of those in power – and swell the coffers of sporting bodies and athletes – than to improve the lot and lives of ordinary people.That does not necessarily mean Joshua should not be fighting in Saudi Arabia, or the IAAF should not stage the world championships in Doha, but heads should not be buried in the sand either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a8f3f0008a4df6c250c7ff1a3b1695ad430f416/0_40_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9158d896beab97367e4a61ffcb2ab63a","title":"f1 2019 seaon to remember lewis hamilton charles leclerc","story":"Even by his own high standards Lewis Hamilton set a new benchmark in 2019. In a class of his own, his sixth championship was defined by opening with an almost crushing, relentless run that all but had the job done by the summer break. After Valtteri Bottas started strongly and the teammates shared two wins apiece, Hamilton found another plane. Four from four followed including harassing Sebastian Vettel into an error in Canada, a tyre management masterclass in Monaco and a clinical, precision dissection in France where he finished 18 seconds ahead. Silverstone and Hungary were standouts too, as was Mexico. The 34-year-old was near flawless, Germany being almost the only exception. His touch and control were unmatched in a season that showcased a sportsman at the peak of his powers.Few imagined Charles Leclerc could arrive at Ferrari in his first season for the Scuderia and rise to the challenge with such consummate ability. In only his second season in F1, Leclerc gave notice he has every chance to be a future world champion. Lined up against the four-time champion Vettel, who was given lead‑driver status, and under the scrutiny and spotlight of driving for Ferrari, the 22-year-old was majestic. His run in only the second round in Bahrain was magnificent, that of a driver beyond his years and a win was denied only by a mechanical problem. He scored the most poles this season with seven and deservedly took victories at Monza and Spa. Of course he made errors but after every one he appeared to emerge wiser and stronger. Other drivers have wilted under similar pressure, Leclerc blossomed.Since his crash in practice at Monaco last year, after which he faced considerable criticism for his driving style, Max Verstappen has developed as a more complete driver. This season he exhibited the qualities that define him as a champion in waiting. The aggressive, daring instincts that make him so compelling to watch remain, as demonstrated in his pass on Leclerc in Austria and again in Abu Dhabi but they have been tempered with more control and judgment. His battle with Leclerc at Silverstone was equally gripping while his win in the wet in Germany was a tour de force as all around him fell apart at the Hockenheimring. Perhaps most indicative of how far he has come was the clinical victory, having been on top all weekend, in Brazil. Verstappen’s fifth season in F1 was his best yet.There is a way to go until they are back fighting with the big three but seeing a resurgent McLaren is only good for F1. Their fourth place in the championship is their highest finish since 2012 and was thoroughly deserved as they were consistently the best of the rest. With a car that was competitive, the team proved to be able to step up to match it with their execution. Better still in Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz they have a formidable driver pairing. Britain’s Norris proved every bit of his potential in a debut season of which he and the team can be proud. He was not awed by going wheel to wheel with Hamilton and Vettel, and was impressively mature in coping with setbacks out of his control. Sainz, too, showed exactly why he has long been highly rated. His pass on Alexander Albon and Daniil Kvyat up the hill at Monaco was breathtaking. Put together this is as strong as McLaren have been for some time and is wholly welcome.A largely turgid French Grand Prix closed with Mercedes and Hamilton looking to run away with the season and perhaps fears the racing would subsequently not deliver, but a sequence of meetings followed that were stunning. Austria was gripping with Verstappen hunting Leclerc then Silverstone was an end-to-end tumult of passing, scrapping and incident, with the drivers coming away once more with high praise for the old airfield. Chaos, error and drama followed in Germany at a race where second place was held by nine drivers and the crowd roared their approval of Verstappen’s win. Then in Hungary Hamilton and Mercedes came back at Red Bull and Verstappen. It was the first time they had been wheel to wheel and unmissable. The four-race sequence was salutary reminder that F1 can still deliver like no other series.After winter testing every indication was that Ferrari were gong into the season with a pace advantage. A real fight at the front with Mercedes was highly anticipated. Within four races it had almost entirely dissipated. Their engine indeed had the edge but it transpired they lacked the balance, downforce and grip to exploit it on the majority of tracks. While Mercedes proved they had their front-wing concept working perfectly, Ferrari were foundering. Even with an advantage, the Scuderia, Vettel and Leclerc would have had to be at the top of their games to challenge Mercedes and often they were not. With the car not where they needed it to be, and Vettel in particular finding it a handful, they swiftly fell away. Mercedes were unbeaten for the eight opening races. Ferrari’s disappointment at failing to challenge was echoed by fans spoiling for a good fight.The death of the Frenchman Anthoine Hubert in an F2 race during the Belgian F1 Grand Prix weekend at Spa was a huge blow for the sport and a tragedy for everyone involved. Hubert died after a high-speed accident when exiting Eau Rouge. The 22-year-old went off and, having hit the barriers and returned to the track, then took a second impact from the car of Juan Manuel Correa, who could do nothing to avoid it. Hubert was taken to the medical centre but died shortly afterwards. Correa had to receive extensive leg and spinal surgery and is beginning a lengthy recovery process. The accident was so severe that it shocked everyone, but there was also great sadness this year at the deaths of Niki Lauda and the FIA race director Charlie Whiting. In each case the racing community came together in grief and sympathy and to pay tribute, displaying the very best of the sport at some of its lowest ebbs.For Williams the final chequered flag can surely not have fallen soon enough on a season they will want to forget. Their car was unfinished for the opening days of the first test and when they finally put it on track it was way off the pace, lacked downforce and stability and the team became rooted to the back of the grid. With only one point, this is their worst season in a 42-year history that has returned nine constructor titles and seven drivers’ championships. There was no pleasure to be had in seeing the team who epitomise the spirit of racing in F1 brought so low. Yet in the midst of all this Britain’s George Russell, in his rookie season, managed to tame the recalcitrant beast with a series of performances that gave notice as to why he, too, has a such a promising career in front of him. If Williams can come back from this nadir, he will surely lead their recovery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b22ea600a9c5a5da1fc0947f2da17793e2e986f/0_630_3288_1972/master/3288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2abd6becfdbf6c0607b18870de42788c","title":"the big picture gideon mendel south africa","story":"In 1990, when the photographer Gideon Mendel left his native South Africa for London, he deposited a number of boxes in his friend’s garage in Johannesburg for safekeeping. These boxes contained, among other things, negatives and transparencies from Mendel’s harrowing first few years as a photojournalist during the struggle against apartheid in the mid-80s.Over the next three decades, Mendel became renowned for his intimate, socially engaged photography, documenting the effects of the HIVAids crisis and climate breakdown. For one project, from his Drowning World series, he has gathered nearly 2,000 water-damaged family photographs picked up on his journeys through flooded communities in the US, India and elsewhere.In this image, taken at a mass funeral in Duduza township outside Johannesburg in 1985, the damage forms a frame within a frame, cropping the image to highlight the protester. The effect is “amazing”, says Mendel, even if the context was sobering: the young activists being buried were killed when an undercover agent gave eight people booby-trapped hand-grenades, which exploded when the pins were pulled. Funerals such as this often led to further outbreaks of violence, and more funerals.“The original images have an almost radioactive energy from that period they carry all the weight of history,” says Mendel. “And then you have this new layer, the effects of water and time and mould on the images” – they speak to Mendel of the deterioration of memory, and the fading of hope in post-apartheid South Africa – “which creates a much more complex and nuanced statement than the photograph can make on its own.

But there’s a more hidden world of immersive art exhibitions, atmospheric arcades, floating swimming pools and edgy jazz nights to exploreExplore an under-the-radar art institutionOne art space on every trendy Parisian’s lips is the child-friendly Atelier des Lumières, a former iron foundry that hosts exquisite projection shows based on the oeuvre of a single artist – so far, it has featured Gustav Klimt and Vincent van Gogh. Expect all the walls, floors, ceilings and attendees’ faces to literally light up. The Cent Quatre cultural centre is where to head for cutting-edge contemporary art and live hip-hop, plus bargains from the on-site Emmaüs Défi store. If you’re into photography – and have a day or two to spare – the Maison Européenne de la Photographie, the Jeu de Paume and the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson make a truly world-beating trio.Survey the skylineThat lineup of magnificent sights stretching from Notre Dame to Les Invalides is best viewed not from the Eiffel Tower, but from the north-eastern Parc de Belleville. Climb up to the graffiti-clad Belvédère Willy Ronis on a weekday and chances are you’ll be the only one there. Another underappreciated panorama, this time facing Sacré-Cœur, can be found 20 minutes’ walk away, from the Temple de la Sybille folly perched 50 metres above the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont’s artificial lake. Jean Nouvel’s epic Philharmonie de Paris offers both an exemplary concert programme and photo-worthy rooftop views. More adventurous types will take to the left bank’s Parc André Citroën, where you can float 150 metres up beneath a helium-filled balloon.Get up close with Paris’s avant gardeSurrealists may have dominated Montparnasse in the 1920s – Marcel Duchamp, Salvador Dalí and Man Ray were regulars at its salons and cafes – but Russian émigré Ossip Zadkine still hadn’t let cubism go. His tranquil studio and garden on the Rue d’Assas brim with angular, African-inspired sculptures in red wood, plaster, stone and clay. The Musée Zadkine is one of several well-preserved former artists’ studios and homes that hark back to yesteryear Paris. Just around the corner, the Musée Bourdelle is both homely atelier and sprawling art museum, while the Fondation Giacometti houses a reconstruction of his storied studio and an exhibition of some of his greatest works, including the Grande tête mince. Up in Pigalle, the cavernous top levels of the Musée National Gustave Moreau shouldn’t be missed, and the same goes for the Musée de la Vie Romantique, a quaint villa built by Dutch painter Ary Scheffer that’s now a museum dedicated to the Romantic era.Reclaim the city’s abandoned railwaysAbandoned to nature since 1934 and encircling pretty much the whole city, La Petite Ceinture railway network will probably never run again (though, some think it should). These days, the public parts of the 12-mile route – in the 12th, 13th, 15th, 16th and 20th arrondissements – make for an unexpectedly lush urban ramble. One former station in the north has been converted into urban farm and eco-friendly restaurant La Recyclerie, and another’s become Le Hasard Ludique, a multipurpose arts space that hosts everything from tango lessons to drag nights. Train stations, it seems, are Paris’s new cool: two recent openings – experimental music venue La Station Gare des Mines and jazz club La Gare – put on the city’s edgiest nights out.Duck into an old-world arcadeShould it sheet down – which, frankly, isn’t all that unlikely – the city’s hidden network of passages couverts make for the ideal atmospheric escape. You could spend days browsing these “covered passages”, with their quaint boutiques and tasteful teahouses. Snaking through the Grands Boulevards area and down towards the Louvre, the Passage des Panoramas is best for lunch, Passage Verdeau for antiques (and waxworks at the Musée Grévin), and Galerie Vivienne for high-end fashion. Don’t miss Galerie Vivienne’s gorgeous glass roof and beautiful mosaicked floors. And when you’re done, head to the Rue des Lombards for live jazz at one of the strip’s handful of legendary clubs, such as the Baiser Salé, the Duc des Lombards or SunsetSunside.Take the plunge at a scenic swimming spotYou might not be able to swim in the Seine, but you can swim on it. Moored next to the imposing Bibliothèque François Mitterrand in the south-east, the Piscine Joséphine Baker is a floating pool complete with saunas, hammams, a jacuzzi, and to-die-for Seine views, preserved in winter by a sliding glass roof. Built in the 1920s, the Butte-aux-Cailles swimming pool is another option for those looking to go for a dip in the great outdoors (there’s an indoor pool and two outdoor pools). And don’t worry about getting chilly the water is a balmy 28C.Pay tribute to the city’s illustrious deadIf you haven’t already been on a teenage pilgrimage to pay Jim Morrison and Oscar Wilde your respects, then it’s well worth spending a day trying to locate them in the 44-hectare Cimetière du Père Lachaise. Molière, Honoré de Balzac, Marcel Proust, Colette, Édith Piaf: it’s easy to stumble upon recognisable names here. Take a map, or don’t – this place lends itself to an aimless gander. Less likely to throng with tour groups are the low-key Cimetière de Montmartre (Alexandre Dumas, Edgar Degas, François Truffaut) and Cimetière de Montparnasse (Charles Baudelaire, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir). Serge Gainsbourg is buried in the latter, but his former home by the Seine is where his fans gather en masse. For some light relief, the Deyrolle is an eccentric taxidermy museum and shop where you’ll find curiosities of a very different sort, while the Musée des Arts Forains feels like a gaudy graveyard of disused funfair rides.Discover Paris with easyJet flights from 10 different UK airports.

And there isn’t much evidence to show customers are getting the quality they’re paying forCustomers stream into the parking lot of a San Diego strip mall, lining up behind a windmill-shaped vending machine that fills their jugs for 25 to 35 cents a gallon.“The water that comes from the tap, I don’t trust it, and it doesn’t taste good,” Miguel Martinez said on a recent afternoon, as he filled his bottle from the kiosk. Martinez lives in San Diego’s nearby Shelltown neighborhood, an area located minutes from downtown where many immigrant families have landed.“Good water right here,” his friend says, patting the machine.Martinez says he doesn’t mind paying a little extra money for what he believes is premium water that tastes better than what comes from his home faucet. It’s a steal compared with the inidually sealed bottles you can buy at the store, he said.“I never drink tap water,” Eddie, a different customer who declined to give his last name, said in Spanish. He got used to buying bottled water 15 years ago when he lived in Mexico and never went back to tap water.Eddie, who works in construction, said when he is at home he drinks sealed water bottles he buys from the store, but he keeps the three-gallon jugs he fills up at the kiosks when he goes to work.Water vending machines have become a common feature in southern California. They’re not new – the state’s department of public health has licensed them since 1989 – and at first glance, they seem to offer a solution for California’s struggle to provide clean drinking water for all of its residents. Customers even swear by the improved taste and believe it is safer than tap water, even if there is not much evidence that they’re getting the quality they’re paying for.But records suggest that the department has been lax in regulating the industry and double-checking the vending machines.When the investigative news outlet Voice of San Diego dug into the issue earlier this year, it found that in 2015, the department only inspected two of the 1,100 machines in San Diego county, for example. Midway through 2019, it hadn’t inspected any. A spokesperson for the public health department told the  statewide data for this year was not immediately available. In the past, water and public health officials have raised concerns over the machines’ safety when they’re not properly regulated.In 1997, when the public health department still relied on water vending operators to inspect their own machines, the environmental toxicology bureau in Los Angeles county found that the dispensers located in southern California supermarkets had higher levels of bacteria than plain tap water – likely related to old filters or dirty spigots on the machines.“You’re safer drinking the tap water,” a water official said at the time. “Not only are you safer, but you’re paying, oh, let’s see, about 250 times less per gallon.”A few years later, a study by the not-for-profit Environmental Working Group found that water from two-thirds of the machines they tested in California, owned by the then industry leader, Glacier Water, did not match its marketing claims in terms of contaminants.At the time of its merger, Primo said the acquisition gave it 46,000 retail locations in the US and Canada. Today Primo is valued at $400m.Vending machine companies usually offer a cut of their sales and possibly a signing bonus to stores that allow them to use their space.The market is so profitable it has sparked ugly turf wars between water companies competing for the coveted space in front of stores.About seven years ago, one vending machine company, Mountain’s Peak, filed a complaint against Glacier and accused it of threatening and pressuring store owners to sign contracts with Glacier. Glacier, in turn, accused Mountain Peak of benefitting from a plot to sabotage its machines and steal business.The two companies eventually settled and agreed not to tamper with each other’s machines.“It’s really a nasty business. It’s not a gentleman’s business,” Ed Rose, an attorney who represented Mountain’s Peak, told Voice of San Diego this year.The concerns raised over lax regulation don’t seem to matter to the dozens of customers who line up to fetch water from the machines – many of them located in front of liquor stores and strip malls in low-income neighborhoods and immigrant communities.Watermill Express, which operates the windmill-shaped water kiosks, did not respond to questions from the . But when asked in 2015 why so many kiosks were found in low-income neighborhoods, Lani Dolifka, the Watermill co-founder, told Fast Company that “budget conscious” clientele deserve options, too.“Not everyone can afford to buy bottled water or have a water delivery service, but everyone needs access to safe, affordable, pure drinking water,” she said.Debi Ores, a senior attorney with the Community Water Center, a not-for-profit organization that works to improve access to clean water for residents in central California, said the distrust of tap water is understandable for immigrants who come from countries without clean drinking water.“If the water looks or smells a little funny, they might not have faith that the water is safe to drink. Especially if they’ve known people or had family members who’ve gotten sick from drinking the water.”But the Environmental Working Group, which researches environmental issues, took a sharper view of the marketing in a 2002 report. At the time, it said the then industry leader, Glacier, was exploiting immigrants’ fear of tap water to turn in order to turn a profit.“On the surface, the targeting of recent immigrants may seem like smart niche marketing. But on closer examination, it is cynical and exploitative,” the report read.“Glacier’s marketing strategy takes advantage of the fact that new arrivals, many of whom have limited English skills, may not know that California tap water is safer than the water back home. Then it charges people who can least afford it an inflated price for a basic necessity.”Neither Primo nor Watermill Express responded to multiple phone calls and emails from the .Questions over marketing aside, residents could be forgiven for not trusting the contents of their tap water.In recent years, California schools have been scrutinized for providing drinking water with high concentrations of lead – contamination that can happen when ageing pipes leach lead into the water before it leaves the faucet, said Alexis Temkin, a toxicologist with EWG.“There’s really no safe levels of lead, especially for children,” Temkin said. “It’s not necessarily a problem with the quality of the water that the utility is providing, but what’s coming out in the back end,” she said.In a school less than two miles away from where Eddie and Martinez filled up their jugs, officials were alerted to contaminated water after a therapy dog reportedly refused to drink. When officials tested the water they found lead as well as a chemical that came from plastic pipes. It was probably the reason the school nurse reported that students vomited after drinking the water.More than schools are at risk, though homes in low-income communities are particularly prone to contamination tied to ageing infrastructure and lax monitoring standards, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.Anxiety over having enough clean water has loomed over California for years.Panic set in four years ago after a winter of unusually low snowfall, which the state relies on to refill water reservoirs, exacerbated drought conditions. Cities began issuing water restrictions, but by May of that year nearly 2,000 wells had run dry, leaving some communities without water.The seven-year drought officially ended this year, but the dry stretch highlighted the precarious nature of water in California.Meanwhile, an estimated 1 million residents in California still go without clean water, many of them in the Central Valley, the state’s agricultural hub, which produces a quarter of the nation’s produce.Water vending machines may seem like an appropriate response to providing clean water for communities that struggle to provide it. But experts and advocates list a number of reasons why vended water falls short as a solution and may even further strain the residents who most need it.While the majority of water kiosks are found in southern California, the regions that accrued the most violations for contaminated drinking water are located north of Los Angeles, in less populous areas of the state, according to EWG’s tap water database, which includes enforcement and compliance related information.And the fact that the kiosks typically need a water supply that already meets federal and state standards means the machines wouldn’t work for areas where clean water is most scarce – places such as the San Joaquin Valley, which Jonathan London, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, has studied extensively.Vended water could help some, but it also imposes additional burdens on families, London said.“It’s not a great solution, long-term,” London said. “The vending machines unfortunately are not well-regulated.”A lot of the people who are dependent on vended water don’t have cars, so it is hard for them to actually access it, he said. And buying filtered water, on top of the water coming through their pipes, puts an extra financial burden on low-income families and cuts into their monthly income, he said.London and Ores instead favor longer-term solutions, like getting more residents off private-well water and on to public water systems of larger jurisdictions, which have more resources to treat and monitor water.The Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund, linked to legislation the California governor, Gavin Newsom, signed this year, could provide some relief. The plan allocates up to $130m a year to help cash-strapped districts improve access to clean water.Ores said it was a step toward sustainability and providing people the clean water they are entitled to.“People are spending a huge part of their income just on a basic human right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96b1e692d47845ea236081cff7ad18ef30fd048a/274_4_3260_1956/master/3260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1605b41195f57c369ca2b6ee4f437148","title":"joe biden student loan debt 2005 act 2020","story":"The former vice-president - and 2020 presidential hopeful - backed a 2005 bill that stripped students of bankruptcy protections and left millions in financial stressIn 10 weeks’ time Joe Biden will lay “Joe’s vision for America” at the feet of Iowa’s caucus-goers in the hope that the first voters in the Democratic presidential race will put him on the road to the White House.Among his promises is that he will fix the student loan crisis saddling 45 million Americans with crippling debt now totalling a staggering $1.5tn. One idea is to allow people struggling to repay private student loans owed to banks and credit card companies to discharge them in bankruptcy.The pledge is one of the most striking policies on offer from Democratic candidates in the 2020 race, given how the problem Biden now proposes to resolve came about in the first place. Private student loans were largely stripped of bankruptcy protections in 2005 in a congressional move that had the devastating impact of tripling such debt over a decade and locking in millions of Americans to years of grueling repayments.The Republican-led bill tightened the bankruptcy code, unleashing a huge giveaway to lenders at the expense of indebted student borrowers. At the time it faced vociferous opposition from 25 Democrats in the US Senate.But it passed anyway, with 18 Democratic senators breaking ranks and casting their vote in favor of the bill. Of those 18, one politician stood out as an especially enthusiastic champion of the credit companies who, as it happens, had given him hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions – Joe Biden.Student debt has become a hot-button issue on the Democratic campaign trail. Candidates are vying to position themselves as having the most radical solution to the crisis, which now holds more than one in three young adults in its grip as well as 3 million Americans beyond the age of 60 still laboring to honor college loans they took out decades ago.But very little discussion has been devoted to how this monumental disaster came about. How was it, for instance, that the sum of outstanding educational loans borrowed from private financial entities shot up from $56bn in 2005 to $150bn in just 10 years – contributing to an overall student debt burden second in the US only to home mortgages.Until 2005, private student loans were eligible for bankruptcy protections just like other forms of private credit. But in that year Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, a law that made it vastly more difficult for struggling former students to rebuild their lives by discharging the debts and starting over.Earlier this year, Biden tried to justify his backing of the 2005 act. His campaign spokesman told Politico that “knowing that the bill was likely to make it through the Republican-led Congress, he worked to moderate the bankruptcy bill and protect middle class families. He believed that if you have income and consumer debts you can pay, you should agree to a repayment plan that you can afford.”Dig into the record, and you find a more complicated story that puts Biden in a less flattering posture. His offer to the caucus-goers of Iowa when they gather on 3 February is in effect that he will reverse a damaging provision that in 2005 he himself voted through. Despite his protestations, it is indisputable that Biden was an avid supporter of the 2005 bill as a whole and of its overall thrust of tightening up the bankruptcy code largely to the benefit of lenders at the expense of distressed families who would find it harder to file for bankruptcy.“Biden was one of the most powerful people who could have said no, who could have changed this. Instead he used his leadership role to limit the ability of other Democrats who had concerns and who wanted the bill softened,” said Melissa Jacoby, a law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill specialising in bankruptcy.“This legislation breaks the bond that unites America, it sacrifices Americans to the rampant greed of the credit card industry,” he said. Kennedy warned that even before the new provision kicked in young people were dropping out of college “because of the costs of student loans – they can’t pay them”.When an earlier version of the bill was in front of Congress, a respected law professor at Harvard law school was so incensed by its terms that in 2002 she wrote an entire paper decrying Biden’s forceful support of it. The author – Elizabeth Warren – said the changes would be to the detriment of one group above all others: women.“Senator Biden supports legislation that will fall hardest on women,” she wrote. “Why? The answer will have to come from him … He is a zealous advocate on behalf of one of his biggest contributors – the financial services industry.”Warren, whose decision to enter politics was inspired in no small part by her experiences of fighting Congress over bankruptcy laws, goes on to note in her essay that Biden’s “energetic work on behalf of the credit card companies has earned him the affection of the banking industry and protected him from any well-funded challengers for his Senate seat”.Warren’s suspicion that Biden’s enthusiasm for toughening bankruptcy laws came from his close ties to the credit card companies persists to this day. Professor Jacoby said: “I don’t know how else to explain his stance on bankruptcy policy for financially distressed families other than his relationship with the consumer credit industry. There really isn’t another plausible explanation.”As a US senator from Delaware, a state that hosts many of the largest financial corporations in the country, that relationship came naturally. So friendly were his links with the Delaware-incorporated MBNA, a major credit card company since taken over by Bank of America, that back in 1999 he felt it necessary to declare: “I’m not the senator from MBNA”.Campaign finance watchdogs underline the point. In the 2003-2008 senatorial election cycle, Biden received more than $500,000 in help from credit card companies, financial services and banks, the Open Secrets database shows.In the lead up to the 2005 bankruptcy act, Biden tried to justify his support for the legislation by pointing to abuse of the bankruptcy system by people who should at least pay back some of their debts. By requiring better-off borrowers to repay what they could afford, private lenders would be able to reduce their interest rates to the benefit of all consumers.“The evidence is not there – making bankruptcy laws more protective of lenders did not lead to more access and cheaper credit,” Jacoby said.What the 2005 act did do was to herald an explosion in private student loans. Lenders, confident in the knowledge that it would be much more difficult in future for debts to be discharged, opened their arms wide to new borrowers.Most outstanding student loans are owed to the federal government. Discharging federal student loans in bankruptcy is similarly tightly proscribed, but the pain of those restrictions is heavily tranquilised by schemes that help borrowers who fall into trouble including loan forgiveness.Private student loans by contrast have no such cushion. The only hope for a borrower falling behind in repayments is if they can prove “undue hardship” – a standard that is almost impossible to meet and that often involves litigation costing thousands of dollars they do not have.“Private student loans tend to have higher interest rates than federal loans, are far less flexible when borrowers are struggling, and are not eligible for programs like income-driven repayment or loan forgiveness,” said Adam Minsky, a bankruptcy attorney who takes on student loans cases.In Joe’s Vision, Biden points to an attempt in 2015 by the Obama administration, in which he was the vice-president, to allow at least some private student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy. He promises that a Biden presidency would enact that legislation – effectively reversing his earlier 2005 vote.But other than that he has remained largely silent on the subject and has not offered a retraction of his earlier voting record.  asked the Biden campaign to respond to the accusation that his support of the 2005 act, encouraged by his close ties to Delaware corporations, has made it harder for millions of Americans struggling with private student loans. There was no immediate reply.So far on the Democratic presidential trail the subject of Biden’s role in the 2005 reforms has attracted remarkably little attention. The former vice-president has had to atone for his treatment of Anita Hill when she accused the US supreme court justice nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in 1991 and for his support of the 1994 crime bill that heralded mass incarceration, but on student loans he has largely avoided scrutiny.Warren – no longer a law professor, a political rival now – made a passing reference to his record on bankruptcy on the day Biden launched his presidential bid in April. “At a time when the biggest financial institutions in this country were trying to put the squeeze on millions of hardworking families, Joe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdd1dddeec94ac07c716820e5ae2c3ab80d9eacf/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb2bf2da87cb749d1c546d131b7ce8b2","title":"amazon pulls disturbing christmas ornaments bearing images of auschwitz","story":"Move came after Auschwitz Memorial in Poland called on the e-commerce company to remove the ‘disrespectful’ productsA Polish museum has criticised US e-commerce giant Amazon for selling Christmas ornaments decorated with images of the Nazi German death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau.The museum at the site of the former camp in southern Poland tweeted screenshots of the items showing train tracks and barracks and requested that Amazon remove them from their site.“Selling ‘Christmas ornaments’ with images of Auschwitz does not seem appropriate.

All physical stores in the country have had until 1 December to begin implementing the new standards.The measure, described by the ministry of industry and information as a way to “protect the legitimate rights and interest of citizens in cyberspace”, makes Chinese mobile phone and internet users easier to track.Already, mobile phone users are required to register SIM cards with their identity cards or passports and many telecoms had begun scanning customers’ faces since last year. Many social media platforms also require users to sign up with their “real-name identities” via their phone numbers.The expansion of the use of facial recognition in China, from middle schools to concert venues and public transport, has begun raising concerns about information security and consent.In November, a professor filed what is believed to be the country’s first lawsuit against the use of facial recognition. Guo Bing, a professor at Zhejiang Sci-Tech University alleged that a safari park in Hangzhou violated the country’s consumer rights protection law by scanning his face and taking his personal data without his consent.China’s education ministry said in September it would “curb and regulate” the use of facial recognition after parents grew angry when facial recognition software was installed without their knowledge at a university in Nanjing to monitor students’ attendance and focus during class.Experts also caution that China lacks regulation on how facial recognition can be used. More than two dozen Chinese technology companies have begun drafting national standards for the industry.Human rights advocates described the measure as another step toward “dystopian surveillance state”, in which Chinese cities will more closely resemble the Xinjiang region, where citizens are constantly monitored for signs of unrest or dissent.The ministry has said the rule will protect citizens from phone scams and prevent the reselling of SIM cards as part of cybersecurity and antiterrorism campaigns.On the microblog Weibo, many internet users were supportive of the move, with one writing: “As someone who has had their identity stolen, I feel relieved.” Another said: “Even though this is coming too late, I support it.”But others were not confident the new rule would strengthen information security. One user wrote: “If privacy laws are not sound … then you really do not have the right to require more and more personal information from the people.

It needed to be a true masterpiece.”The duo, who also together run a Copenhagen design studio, have purchased paintings by three other recognised Danish artists, John Kørner, David Birkemose and Jens Birkemose, helped by funding from an unnamed patron.Tal R in October dismissed the project in an email to the Politiken newspaper, as a “disrespectful” attempt “to make money and get attention by making a product out of my art”.His lawyer, Jørgen Permin, argued in a one-day hearing at the maritime and commercial court in Copenhagen in November that the scheme was a clear case of copyright infringement.“He acknowledges that whoever purchases one of his works would be at liberty to sell it on or even destroy the work,” Permin said. “But what he is not obliged to accept is for someone to alter the work and then reintroduce it to the public domain, and particularly not for commercial reasons.”Heidi Højmark Helveg, who represented Thorleifsson and Leivsgard, argued that as the project involved destroying rather than altering the work, it was legal under Danish law.Permin said this argument failed because the watches would be marketed “specifically as having Tal R’s painting as background”.If the court imposes an injunction, Tal R would then need to launch a further case to confirm it. If the court instead refuses a ban, Thorleifsson and Leivsgard plan in a fortnight to destroy the painting at a public event they are calling a vernissage, a term more commonly used for a preview of an art exhibition.While the pair’s now discontinued Kanske brand had been a commercial venture, Thorleifsson said that the Letho project had from the start been intended to test the boundaries of art.“It’s not a commercial project, but we don’t know if it is an artistic project. That has to be determined by others,” he said.Permin said that as far as his client was concerned, it was not. “He thinks it is a very destructive thing for art, and he doesn’t subscribe to the idea that tearing up his art in this manner would be art itself,” Permin said. “He really wishes this had never happened.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39cb24076c44db628294ff6ac2b1c58559e39eed/0_186_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc224f51c722f4cc45be5362a40509f","title":"kim jong un north korea debuts leather look as he inspects missile test","story":"North Korean leader had previously displayed a penchant for horn-rimmed glasses and black Mao suitsKim Jong-un’s recent wardrobe choices have sparked speculation that after eight years of paying sartorial homage to his popular grandfather, North Korea’s leader is attempting to craft an image of his own.South Korean media commented on the change after Kim was seen last week wearing a leather trench coat during the test of a multiple rocket launcher.The trench coat was the latest of several indications that he has decided to embrace a more eclectic personal style.He had previously displayed a penchant for horn-rimmed glasses and black Mao suits that appeared to be an attempt to style himself in the image of his grandfather – and North Korea’s founder - Kim Il-sung, right down to his severe short-back-and-sides hairstyle.Twenty-five years after his death, the older Kim is still revered by North Koreans for what regime propagandists describe as his leading role in ending Japanese colonial rule and founding North Korea in 1948.Days before his dark trench coat made an appearance, Kim Jong-un sported an ivory-coloured version and a blue shirt while giving “field guidance” at a military base on an island near the maritime border with South Korea.As a young and untested leader when he succeeded his father in December 2011, Kim consolidated his grip on power through several rounds of purges that included the execution of his uncle, while promoting others, such as his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, to positions of power within the ruling party and military.With his position secure, he can now begin to craft a new image that sets him apart from his predecessors, according to Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University.“Kim appears to be striving to build his own image and sphere as much as he can,” Kim told South Korea’s Yonhap news agency.While some observers attributed Kim’s fashion choices to simple personal preferences, Yonhap speculated that the change in style could herald shifts on the diplomatic front, less than a month before a deadline North Korea has set for the US to break the deadlock over stalled denuclearisation talks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3148256f062a1855277fffb90f0322e3cff40e7/2262_921_3738_2243/master/3738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8845011ea61a3fd27394039758deba3c","title":"rendition refusal uk public inquiry judicial review","story":"High court judge grants permission for challenge by David Davis and othersThe government’s refusal to hold a public inquiry into allegations that the security services were complicit in the torture and abduction of terror suspects after 911 is to be subjected to a full scale legal challenge.A high court judge, Mr Justice Hilliard, has granted permission for lawyers representing the former Brexit secretary David Davis, the Labour politician Dan Jarvis and the human rights organisation Reprieve to launch a judicial review of the government’s decision in July not to examine extraordinary rendition claims.Calls for a judge-led investigation were reinforced after parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC) published a damning indictment in 2018 of the role played by the overseas agency MI6 and the domestic service MI5, which were said to have been involved in hundreds of torture cases and scores of rendition cases. The ISC reports said the intelligence agencies had been aware “at an early point” of the mistreatment of detainees by the US and others. There were two cases in which UK personnel were “party to mistreatment administered by others”.One key passage in the report said MI6 had “sought and obtained authorisation from the foreign secretary” for the costs of funding a plane involved in an inidual rendition case. It also found that in 232 cases UK personnel had continued to supply questions or intelligence to other services despite knowledge or suspicion of mistreatment.Jarvis, Davis and Reprieve began legal action after it was announced during the last days of Theresa May’s premiership: “The government has decided that it is not necessary to establish a further inquiry. There is no policy reason to do so, given the extensive work already undertaken to improve policies and practices in this area.”Granting permission for judicial review in a judgment last week, Hilliard noted: “The ISC has said … it was essential to hear from witnesses if the inquiry was to be thorough and comprehensive and in a position to reach properly considered, balanced and fair views about the facts. In the event, witnesses were not made available.“The argument for an unmet investigative obligation emerges from the history of previous investigations which were not completed. It is, I think, properly arguable that witness testimony is particularly important where records may not tell the full story and that systemic failings may not be satisfactorily identified in separate proceedings initiated by iniduals.“Although some lessons have undoubtedly been learned and improvements made, it is open to argument whether all the necessary lessons can have been learned if the facts have not been fully established.”Welcoming the judgment, Davis, who is standing for re-election, said: “This is an excellent result. The court recognised in terms of our argument that on the question of torture and rendition we cannot be certain that all the necessary lessons have been learned without a proper and full investigation of the facts.”Maya Foa, director of Reprieve, said: “We are very pleased the court has found that the government has a case to answer over its failure to properly investigate ‘war on terror’-era torture and rendition. When the government broke its promise to survivors of torture, it also broke the law. The powerful must be held to account so that victims can move on with their lives, but just as importantly because if we do not fully investigate our past mistakes, we are doomed to repeat them.”In May last year, the government gave an unprecedented public apology to two people, Abdul-Hakim Belhaj and Fatima Boudchar, for British involvement in their rendition to be tortured in Libya."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b868811f0b3584b5ddbc7e74e8da25120e792b58/0_155_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a7180a1afa2160e6f9b400a7505d927","title":"venice rejects autonomous rule referendum low turnout italy","story":"Majority of referendum voters support autonomy but low turnout means result is invalidThe vote was preceded by heated debates after devastating floods in November, and pro-separatists had anticipated a higher turnout.“We were expecting a much better result,” said Marco Gasparinetti, who leads the Gruppo 25 Aprile activist group. “We’ll now take some time to reflect to understand what we can do going forward for the good of our city.”Those who campaigned for autonomy have pledged to appeal against the result, arguing that the quorum was illegitimate as the referendum was only consultative.‌The floods further exposed Venice’s fragility, with separatists believing that the lagoon city would be better equipped to deal with its myriad problems by having control over its own affairs.Venice has 11 inhabited islands and was in control of its own administration until Benito Mussolini’s fascist regime combined it with the industrial Mestre in 1926. The plan worked relatively well until Venice’s population declined, Mestre’s grew and money that was intended to preserve the former got erted into developing the latter, bringing with it shopping centres and huge hotels.Venice’s dwindling population remains one of its biggest concerns: it has fallen from about 175,000 in the postwar years to 55,000 today. Many people have been driven away by mass tourism and the recurrent aqua alta, or high water. Triple the number of people live in Mestre, a budget destination for tourists whose only aim is to see Venice.The latest referendum followed failed attempts to separate in 1989, 1994 and 2003.The Venice mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, was accused of trying to sabotage the vote by encouraging people to abstain.Nicola Pellicani, a parliamentarian with the centre-left Democratic party, who lives in Mestre, also opposed the referendum. He told the : “The outcome showed that the referendum was anachronistic. There is a lot of bad feeling in the historic centre towards the mayor but we can’t split the city over this.

Last week we featured an item from a reader clamped at a Luas park and ride because he appeared to confuse his Xs and his Zeds when paying for parking. He bought a ticket for his WX-registered car at the park-and-ride ticket machine at Balally Luas station but when he returned, the car had been clamped. He rang the National Controlled Parking Services (NCPS), the people behind the clamps and was told he had not, in fact, paid for parking at all.But he had a ticket and receipt. The NCPS people did not seem to care and he had to pay €80 to be declamped – a process which took an hour. When he subsequently made contact with the company, it insisted he had put a “Z” where he should have put “X”. He lodged an appeal and NCPS replied that while it was his mistake, out of the goodness of their hearts, they would refund him €50 – charging him a hefty €30 to process the refund. His sorry tale prompted others to get it touch with stories which are alarming. “Your article this week may have touched the tip of an iceberg,” says Edmond Baily, who had, what he said, was a similar experience to our reader. When he input his car registration number into a machine – starting with the numbers 131D19 – the machine recorded it as 232d29. “When I checked the next day I found the machine was recording a one as a two.”He says the defective machine remained in service for several days before it was repaired, and asks, “how many other victims there were?”Then we got a mail from a couple who live close to the Luas station in question. “Thank you for today’s article on parking mishaps at Balally Luas station,” Malachi O’Neill writes. “As a local, we have noticed that the parking ticket machine on the outbound platform can give some very dodgy results . “Only last Saturday, as we were purchasing a parking ticket, we were forced to use another machine as the car registration we were trying to enter was not the one the machine was reading. There is a five in our car’s registration number. The parking machine was reading this as a four. This was not the first time this has happened to us. All we, as locals, can say is, ‘watch everything’.”So that was interesting. But there was more. Faulty numbers But there was still more. And it was more damning. John Begley read our article and said he had been clamped twice in the Carrickmines park-and-ride Luas site and on each occasion he was clamped for one digit being incorrect on his number-plate entry.“After the first offence, I take particular care so was very surprised second-time around,” he writes. “So the next time I passed I checked the machine, which revealed faulty numbers.”Begley had the good sense to use his phone to record what was happening and in the video he sent us it is clear that when he tried to input the number four, the machine he was using recorded it as the number three. It did this on several occasions. “I checked again later in the day and the issue was resolved, so it is clear that someone is fixing these machines during the day, but no allowance is being made for those caught out in the morning.”So we got back in touch with NCPS again. We pointed out that John Begley not been paying attention he would have keyed in the wrong car registration number through no fault of his own and would most likely have been clamped.Then he would have had to pay as much as €80 to be declamped and at best – if an appeal was successful – he might have got €50 back.We asked if this fault when inputting reg numbers was a known issue? We asked if NCPS could shed any light on what was happening in the video? We asked if it accepted that it is at least possible that the reader from Wexford who we featured last week and who is adamant he keyed in the right reg number was also using a faulty machine?And we wondered if, seeing as how there is clear evidence that the machine in the video sent to us was faulty, could users of the service be sure other machines were not similarly affected?We also wondered if the company could let us know what percentage of those who have been clamped by it were clamped because they had incorrectly input their own car reg number? “NCPS are contracted by the operator for Luas Park and Ride to manage the car park facility. NCPS’s role is to make sure all parkers have paid for parking either by the Ticket Vending Machine or via parkbytext. If they find someone had not paid the vehicle is immobilised. Searching the car registration number is the unique identifier to confirm if the person has paid or not.”It made no comment on the video we sent it and did not acknowledge the concerns expressed by readers. Only when pressed did a spokesman say NCPS “does not own, manage or operate the ticket vending machines”.We had also contacted TransDev, the company which runs the Luas and the associated Park and Ride facilities, and after initially blaming user error for all our readers stories it eventually conceded there was an issue. “Luas have reviewed the customer’s video and we are now doing a full review of the ticket machines across the Luas network,” a spokeswoman said. She said that if a ticket machine is found to be faulty, it is serviced within hours of the report. “A customer who does find fault with a machine should not, however, continue to input incorrect digits and proceed to the payment stage. There are many other machines in the Park and Ride sites.” The spokeswoman said that in most cases where someone makes a mistake when entering their registration number and is clamped, a refund will be granted by NCPS.“We acknowledge there can be a machine error as there is human error too, and customers should be advised further changes to the system will be made to assist with mitigating both”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Motorists at risk of clamping after machine printed incorrect car registration numbersUK-born Shamima Begum had her citizenship revoked by the UK Home Office\u0026lsquoGoing to a particular location is not a terrorist offence,\u0026rsquo says Darragh MackinService were down between Blackhorse and The Point during Monday morning rushWarrant issued after Bailey was convicted in France of Sophie Toscan du Plantier murderGirl (19) kicked in the face before attacker fled in early hours of Sunday morningFarmers need to be seen as part of solution rather than problem, according to TaoiseachA project highlighting the role of the women in the movement is in line for Turner PrizeWoman\u0026rsquos body was discovered in south Dublin apartment along with her children then aged five and 10Row has broken out between OPW and developer JJ Rhatigan over cost overrunsTraffic committee to be asked to approve increase in parking charges up to \u0026euro3.50 an hour in the cityChristian Aid Ireland and Tr\u0026oacutecaire say levels need to increase from \u0026euro80m to \u0026euro475mPressure within Fine Gael for Varadkar to remove Verona Murphy from Wexford general election ticketTeenagers can \u0026lsquopre-register\u0026rsquo to be automatically on electoral register when they turn 18Tijjani Muhammad-Bande also says State has \u0026lsquogood chance\u0026rsquo at winning Security Council seatConstituency profile: on doorsteps in Upper Bann Brexit and Stormont dominateGarda interview with Smith last \u0026lsquopiece of the puzzle\u0026rsquo before file can be sent to DPP"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4101837.1575285284!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"luas park and ride ticket machines to be reviewed after faults","story":"A reader submitted video of a broken ticket machine at Luas station in Dublin  - in this case, the number four doesn\u0027t work.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe fault machine causing problems for park-and-ride Luas users: one user tried to input the number four, but the machine recorded it as the number three.

The results mean Fine Gael has failed to win a seat and this further reduces the Government’s already flimsy majority on confidence votes in the Dáil.With a confidence vote in the Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy due in the Dáil on Tuesday evening, it means that the survival of the Government is now dependent on the votes of independent TDs who have no formal arrangement with Fine Gael Denis Naughten, Noel Grealish, Peter Fitzpatrick and Michael Lowry.The emerging results represent a blow for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar who had pinned his hopes on a win in Dublin Mid West, but a stuttering campaign and huge embarrassment in the party about Wexford candidate Verona Murphy’s comments about immigrants meant that these byelections were even harder than usual to win for an incumbent government.Sinn Féin boostBoth the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe sought to play down the results, but there is little doubt that the results are a disappointment for Fine Gael, if not huge surprise for the party.Fianna Fáil gained one seat with its victories in Wexford and in Cork North Central, where the vacancy was created by the election of Mr Kelleher to the European Parliament in May.The Sinn Féin result in Dublin Mid West was built on an energetic local campaign and a strong get-out-the-vote operation yesterday, which confounded the pattern of record low turnouts elsewhere.It provides a much-needed boost for party leader Mary Lou McDonald after poor local and European elections.The other surprise poll-topping performance of the day was by the Green candidate in Fingal, Joe O’Brien.The Greens Dáil ranks have increased by 50 per cent and encouraging the party to believe a Green wave is possible at next year’s general elections.A clearly delighted Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said on Saturday the votes for the party showed they were the “clear alternative” to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.View current and previous elections and referendums "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4100883.1575148211!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin fingal joe o brien wins green party s first ever byelection","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoe O’Brien: ‘We had the so called green wave in the summer at the local elections, but it’s gaining traction now and I think it’s more than a wave.’ Photograph: Alan BetsonThe The Green Party has won its first ever Dáil byelection as Joe O’Brien emerged as the comfortable victor in Dublin Fingal.Mr O’Brien topped the poll in the 12 candidate field with 5,744 first preference votes, or just under 23 per cent of all first preferences.Turnout in the contest to fill the vacancy created by the election of Clare Daly to the European Parliament was very low at just 25.6 per cent.Mr O’Brien was deemed elected without reaching the quota on the eighth count, with a total vote of 12,315 – just shy of the quota of 12,546 – at the conclusion of the count.Fianna Fáil senator Lorraine Clifford Lee came second and Labour’s Duncan Smith came third on first preference votes and they held their positions until the end of the count.Mr O’Brien’s victory sees him join party leader Eamon Ryan and Dublin Rathdown TD Catherine Martin in the Dáil and builds on a successful local and European elections for the Greens earlier this year.He performed well in areas such as Skerries, Portmarnock and Malahide, an indication that the pattern that support for the Greens is increasing in middle class areas of Dublin, seen in the local and European elections, is holding.Dublin Fingal is a five seat constituency and Mr O’Brien will be well placed to hold his seat at the next election. He is based in Skerries, and the town now is home to three TDs: Mr O’Brien, Labour’s Brendan Ryan and Sinn Féin’s Louise O’Reilly.‘Double and triple’The other two TDs – Fianna Fáil’s Darragh O’Brien and Fine Gael’s Alan Farrell – are based in Malahide. Green Party sources said they wanted to beat Labour in this constituency at the byelection to maintain their momentum on the centre left.Speaking after the count concluded at the National Show Centre in Swords, Mr O’Brien said a lot of work had gone into his victory, but said people are “definitely” “changing their minds” on the climate issue.“We had the so called green wave in the summer at the local elections, but it’s gaining traction now and I think it’s more than a wave,” he said. “I think there’s a bit of a sea change in terms of how people are deciding where to put their votes.”Mr Ryan also said there has been a “change in the last year”.“ There is a green wave of thinking. It’s coming from younger people, but older people responding to that as well.

The message was passed on by our office manager through GChat, and it thrilled me so much that I preserved it.Office manager: Ellen have you been trying to get in touch with the royal family of Oudh?Ellen: this has to be the best telephone message everOffice manager: It was quite strange! The secretary left precise instructions for when you should call her ? tomorrow between 11 am and 12 noonEllen: oh my godI knew about the royal family of Oudh, of course. They were one of the city’s great mysteries. Their story was passed between tea sellers and rickshaw drivers and shopkeepers in Old Delhi: In a forest, they said, in a palace cut off from the city that surrounds it, lived a prince, a princess and a queen, said to be the last of a storied Shia Muslim royal line.There were different versions, depending on whom you spoke to. Some people said the Oudh family had been there since the British had annexed their kingdom, in 1856, and that the forest had grown up around the palace, engulfing it. Some said they were a family of jinns, the supernatural beings of Arabian folklore.An acquaintance who had once glimpsed the princess through a telephoto lens said her hair had not been cut or washed for so many years that it fell to the ground in matted branches. One thing was sure: They didn’t want company. They lived in a 14th-century hunting lodge, which they surrounded with loops of razor wire and ferocious dogs. The perimeter was marked with menacing signs. INTRUDERS SHALL BE GUNDOWN, said one.Macabre storiesEvery few years, the family agreed to admit a journalist, always a foreigner, to tell of their grievances against the state. The journalists emerged with deliciously macabre stories, which I had studied admiringly. In 1997, the prince and the princess told The Times of London that their mother, in a final gesture of protest against the treachery of Britain and India, had killed herself by drinking a poison mixed with crushed diamonds and pearls.I could see why these stories resonated so. The country was imprinted with trauma, by the epic deceit of the British conquest and then the blood bath of the British departure, known as Partition, which carved out Pakistan from India and set off convulsions of Hindu-Muslim violence.This family, displaying its own ruin, was a physical representation of all that India had suffered.A few grainy photographs of the siblings had been published: They were beautiful, pale and high-cheekboned, but also somehow ravaged, harrowed. Nearly every day, dropping my children at school, I drove past the narrow road that led into the middle of the forest, which was surrounded by an ornate wrought-iron fence. The woods were so thick that it was impossible to see much, and inhabited by gangs of monkeys. At night, you could hear jackals howling.The day after I got the message, I dialled the phone number. After a few rings, someone picked up, and I heard a high-pitched, quavering voice on the other end. On the following Monday, I asked our driver to take me into the woods at 5.30 in the afternoon, as instructed.The woods themselves were a bit magical, a thicket in the middle of a city of 20 million. British colonial officers had introduced mesquite trees in the 19th century, and they spread rapidly, swallowing pastures and roads and villages – everything that had been there before. Biologists would later describe it as a “massive invasion” by an “alien species”.We drove farther, until the tree canopy was tormented, thick enough to block out the light.Reader, I should confess that I wanted to write the story. That week, the contents of my inbox were not inspiring: There had been a fire at an ammunition depot. There were budget reports, an unending cycle of state and local elections, the introduction of a goods and services tax.These events, which filled so many of my days at that time, did not entirely satisfy my literary urge. The House of Oudh, now that was a story!Leave the carThe person on the phone had told me to leave the car at the end of the road, beside the high wall of an Indian military compound, and to come alone. This did not surprise me: The Oudh family refused, famously, to meet with Indians. I asked the driver to wait at a distance and stood in the woods, somewhat awkwardly, holding my notebook and wondering what came next.Then the bushes rustled, and a man appeared. He was elfin and wore high-waisted mom jeans. He had high cheekbones with hollows beneath them and wild gray hair that stood up in tufts.“I am Cyrus,” the prince said. It was the high-pitched voice I had heard on the phone.He spoke in bursts, like a person who spent most of his time alone. Then he turned and led me into the woods. I tried to keep up, stepping over a tangle of roots and thorns, and climbed a flight of massive stone stairs leading to the old hunting lodge. It was half-ruined, open to the air, and surrounded by metal gratings one steel bar was loose, and the prince moved it aside with a great clank so that we could enter.I stepped into spare, medieval grandeur, a bare stone antechamber lined with palm trees in brass pots and faded, once-elegant carpets. On the wall hung an oil painting of the prince’s mother swathed in voluminous, dark robes, her eyes closed as if in a trance.The prince led me up to the roof to show me the view. We stopped at the edge of the building, gazing across green treetops to the dusty city, shimmering in the heat. Other great cities may be built on top of ruins, but Delhi is built of them. It is almost impossible to go from one point to another without stumbling over a 700-year-old tomb or a 500-year-old fort.Seven successive Muslim dynasties built their capitals here, each swept aside when its time had passed. The ruins are a reminder that the present dispensation – democracy, Starbucks, Hindu nationalism – is only the blink of an eye in India. We were here, they seem to breathe. This was ours.My idea was to interview the prince and write the story. When I asked about his family, he launched into an animated speech about the perfidy of the British and Indian governments. I recognised quotes from articles I had read, written by colleagues from the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times. He ranted a little, complaining of persecution by a criminal gang. He was flinging his hands wide, declaiming and then dropping to a dramatic whisper, as he spoke of the decline of the house of Oudh.“I am shrinking,” he said. “We are shrinking. The princess is shrinking. We are shrinking.”When I asked if I could publish our interview, he balked. For this, he said, I would need the permission of his sister, Princess Sakina, who was not in Delhi. I would have to come back.It struck me as strange, though. Why summon a journalist if you don’t want to be written about?How it beganThe story began with his mother. She appeared, on the platform of New Delhi’s train station in the early 1970s, seemingly from nowhere, announcing herself as Wilayat, Begum of Oudh.Oudh (pronounced Uh-vud) was a kingdom that no longer existed. The British annexed it in 1856, a trauma from which its capital, Lucknow, never recovered. The core of the city is still made of Oudh’s vaulted shrines and palaces. The begum declared that she would stay in the station until these properties had been restored to her.She settled in the VIP waiting room, and unloaded a whole household there: carpets, potted palms, a silver tea set, Nepali servants in livery, glossy Great Danes. She also had two grown children, Prince Ali Raza and Princess Sakina, a son and a daughter who appeared to be in their 20s. They addressed her as “Your Highness.”The begum was an arresting-looking woman, tall and broad-shouldered, with a face as craggy and immobile as an Easter Island statue. She wore a sari of dark, heavy silk and kept a pistol in its folds. She and her children settled on red plastic chairs, and waited. For years.“Sitting, sitting like yogis,” recalled Father John, a Catholic charity worker who distributed food in the train station. The children were strangely submissive, he said, reluctant even to accept a banana without their mother’s permission.“They were more obedient than the dogs,” he said. “They were absolutely under her control.”The begum’s behaviour was imperious and dramatic. She refused direct conversation, demanding that queries be written on embossed stationery, placed on a silver platter and carried to her by a servant, who read them aloud. If the station master gave her any trouble, she threatened to kill herself by drinking snake venom.“The Nepali servants, they would walk on their knees,” said Saleem Kidwai, a historian who sought them out at the time.Government officials scrambled to find her somewhere to live. She was attracting attention from the media, and officials feared the Shia population in Lucknow could explode into civil unrest if they believed she was being abused.“It was such a romantic image,” Kidwai said. “She is out of the castle, now living in the railway station.”Ammar Rizvi, an aide to the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, was sent to New Delhi as a liaison. He recalled handing Wilayat an envelope with 10,000 rupees – about $90,000 at the time – so that they could set up a household in Lucknow.“In 1975, that was a big sum,” he recalled. “But she got angry and threw the envelope. The notes were flying everywhere, and my public relations officer had to catch this note here, that note there. She said no, she would not go, the amount was very little.”In the months that followed, Rizvi tried to persuade the begum to accept a four-bedroom house in Lucknow, but she refused, saying it was too small. He was getting anxious. Muslims were mobilising once, Rizvi visited during Muharram, an annual ritual of mourning, and found her surrounded by pilgrims, flagellating themselves with chains to which razor blades had been attached.“Poor passengers, they were looking at the whole scene,” he said. “There was blood all over the place.”Making her caseAround this time, Wilayat identified a far more effective way to make her case: foreign correspondents. “India Princess Reigns in Rail Station”, a Times correspondent wrote in 1981, describing her “genuine commitment to redeem the ancestors, to right wrongs suffered over centuries and to obtain justice”.People magazine recorded her declaring, “Let the world know how the descendant of the last nawab of Oudh is treated.”Foreign correspondents arrived, one after another, and readers began to send letters from all corners of the world, expressing outrage on her behalf. The begum imposed stringent conditions – she “could only be photographed when the moon was waning”, United Press International reported – and journalists complied, delighted with the Gothic peculiarity of it all.In 1984, her efforts paid off. Prime minister Indira Gandhi accepted their claim, granting them use of a 14th-century hunting lodge known as Malcha Mahal. They left the train station roughly a decade after they first appeared there. Wilayat never appeared in public again.My responsibilities in New Delhi included a great many diplomatic receptions and buffet dinners, which I found exhausting. It was like being drawn into an imperial court, in which every personal relationship was a series of transactions – exchanges, usually, of bits of status for bits of information. I did not have the clothes for this kind of work, or the personality.So I found it a relief to drive into the forest and sit on Cyrus’s porch, eating pistachios and watching motes of pollen circulate in the sunlight. In a meandering, roundabout way, I was trying to excavate his past. I felt flattered that he allowed me in, again and again, when so many others had been turned away.And yet something also nagged at me about the little family unit, the way they seemed to have scoured away any relationships from before their appearance at the train station.LucknowWhen our conversations had gone on for about nine months, I travelled to Lucknow, a large city in northern India that was the cradle of the Oudh dynasty. I was there to interview detectives for an unrelated story, but I knew that Cyrus had lived there with his mother and sister in the 1970s, so I went to the neighbourhood where I had heard that Oudh descendants lived.There, to my surprise, the old-timers remembered Cyrus and his family. But they told me, almost as an aside, that they had been dismissed as impostors. The Oudh descendants in Kolkata, where the nawab died in exile, had also rejected their claim. And there were questions Cyrus himself seemed unable to answer. Where was he born? Who was his father? How do you crush diamonds, anyway?His sister, Princess Sakina, had not turned up but he gave me a book that she had written, documenting their lives. The book was almost unreadable, haphazardly capitalised, lacking punctuation and written in florid, apocalyptic prose. But sprinkled in the rambling text were flashes of genuine tenderness between the siblings, as if they were two small children, stranded together on a lifeboat.Sakina wrote that she had intended to follow her mother into suicide, but for her brother. The question of his future nagged at her. “ABOUT PRINCE CYRUS RIZA MY BROTHER WHAT STEP SHALL HE FOLLOW?” it says. “MY SILENT SINCEREST SILENCE HAS A WISH THAT PRINCE SHOULD BE BLESSED WITH HAPPINESS.”One night Cyrus called me, howling unintelligibly, to tell me that his sister had in fact died seven months earlier. He had told no one, burying her body himself. He had lied to me about it for months, and seemed a bit ashamed by it. I curled up on my daughter’s bunk bed and listened to his voice over the phone. He said that I should never visit again, and also that he was so lonely.I waited a few days, and then showed up with a Filet O’ Fish from McDonald’s. Our relationship seemed to knit itself back together. He asked me to procure him a gun and a girlfriend, which I did not and a tarpaulin and a recording of Fiddler on the Roof, which I did. He was solicitous and a little corny, with pop culture references that seemed to date from the 1960s.Once, he asked me to kiss him on the cheek – his skin felt fragile, like tissue paper – and he told me that it was the first time he had been kissed in 10 years. “When you are over here, my heart goes doopity doo, Sophia Loren,” he said.He even said I could write something about him, as long as I didn’t go into much detail. “I have to tell the truth,” I told him. “Okay, you have to tell the truth,” he said. “Then again, there is a hole in the bucket, Harry Belafonte.”Final conversationsWe had been debating this for 15 months, and I was due to leave India soon and take up a new assignment in London. This sort of exchange made up the balance of our final conversations: I was trying to get him to reveal something about his origins – anything, really – and he was twisting away from me.“You are just a very mysterious person, because I don’t know who you are,” I said once. His response was coy. “Oh, really,” he said, in a singsong voice. “Well, anyway. Oh, really? If you have said me mysterious, I am just sitting before you.”In our last conversation, a few hours before I boarded a flight for London, he asked me how someone could get word to me, should he die. I asked if he planned to take his own life.“So far, I am going to preserve myself,” he said. “Good. Well, then, I’ll see you again,” I said.I think I hugged him goodbye. The last I saw of him, he was replacing the clanking iron bars that protected him from intruders.Three months later, I was in an airport, on my way home from interviewing the Swedish foreign minister, when I learned Cyrus had died. I got the news on Facebook messenger, from a friend at the BBC.I put down my bag and sat on the airport floor, feeling a little in shock. This feeling was partly selfish. I had a thick file of interviews in a manila envelope labelled “Prince Cyrus”.I had figured that, in this family’s story, there was a parable about India, something about trauma that went unresolved as one empire replaced another.And then there was a second feeling. I was sad that I was not there to help him. I had enjoyed our conversations, the maddening dance of 18 months. I could not believe that he had died alone in that forsaken place. I was sure that in the dark, he had wanted someone to hold his hand. Thinking about this made it difficult to breathe. I stayed there for a moment, in the corridor at the airport, while people hurried past, rolling suitcases behind them.It was the guards at the military facility next door – they called him “rajah”, or king – who later recounted how he had died. Three weeks after we said goodbye, Cyrus was seen trying to wheel his bicycle down the road, shaking violently. An electrician from the military facility helped him to his feet, and he staggered back to the hunting lodge. He asked for a bottle of lemonade and an ice cream.Rajinder Kumar, one of the guards, said it seemed to be dengue fever. I’ve had dengue. It’s like being wiped off the face of the Earth. For me, it began with a penetrating ache in my shoulder, and then, as I sweated through the hotel sheets, hallucinations. My senses were altered. When I drank water from the tap, it tasted like a mouthful of tin.I don’t know what Cyrus hallucinated. His illness may have progressed into haemorrhagic fever, with bleeding from the gums and nose, and under the skin. Patients dying of haemorrhagic fever sometimes have such low blood pressure that no pulse can be detected. Rajinder said Cyrus had refused to be taken to the hospital.“Madam, I really tried very hard,” he said. “I said we would call the police, we would take you to the hospital, but no, no, no. We are outsiders, third-party people, we can’t apply that kind of pressure. Had we been family we could have just taken his hand and taken him.”Rajinder thought it came down to pride. “He used to have the attitude that he was the king,” he said. “That is why he did not want to go to the hospital, that he did not want to be a normal person.”His illness lasted eight days. A boy, sent up to check on his welfare, saw him stalking the property half-clothed, naked from the waist down, or shivering under a mosquito net. Then, after a day or so, no one saw him, and the boy found him dead, curled on the rock floor.Back to Malcha MahalI climbed the stone stairs to Malcha Mahal several months later with a kind of curiosity that was in some ways like greed. I had returned to India for a few days, to see what I could find among his possessions.It is legitimate to ask why I was doing all this. I asked it myself. “Is Cyrus a white whale?” was the subject line of an email I sent my editor. I had become curious – Okay, obsessively curious – about how a family with wealth and status had become lost in the forest. About who they were. Stories like that had always flipped a switch in me, spilling outside the boundaries of the assignment. Something similar had happened to me once, years before, when I pieced together the life story of a woman who had stabbed her children in a basement.When I felt I was making progress it was a calming feeling, as if a cloud of buzzing, disparate information were being forced through a funnel, into a clear stream. Small breakthroughs would drive me forward, like a gambler. On such assignments it was possible to forget unpaid bills, unanswered telephone calls, to set aside anything not required to follow the trail.Cyrus and his family had lived through a great historical rupture: the country’s ision. My sense was that the answer lay there, in an act of government that disrupted the lives of half a continent. But what made me think I could track them down after all these years? Say I did – what could be more interesting than the story they told about themselves?This is what was going through my head as I climbed those stairs. Cyrus’s death had received lots of media coverage, inside India and abroad, and thrill-seekers had tramped through Malcha Mahal, taking video with their phones, hoping to see a ghost. The floor of the entry hall was a havoc of discarded papers that had been dumped from the wardrobe and chest of drawers.I leafed through the letters, looking for a birth certificate, a passport, something that anchored this family in the factual world. What I found instead was a chronicle of 30 years of interactions with journalists. This, it seemed, was the family business. There were dozens of requests from reporters. I have written enough letters of this kind in my life to recognise their pleading tone. Some were written in elaborate, courtly language. Others offered money.Sitting there on the carpet, I laughed out loud. Cyrus and his family would string them along – as he had strung me along – and then, when the mood struck them, disdainfully refuse the interview. The Oudhs were the ones with the story. They had the upper hand.Among the family papers was a column from The Statesman, published in 1993, with the headline “When History Is Based on Errors”. Two paragraphs had been marked.“Have you noticed that a factual error appearing in respected printed form tends to be copied by other researchers in the same field, until, inevitably, it competes with the truth for credibility?” it read. “The writers who perpetuate these mistakes rarely do so from evil motive: They have no axe to grind, they simply do not have time to check and double-check each fact, so they rely on the scholarship of their predecessors.”Two things genuinely surprised me. The first was a stack of receipts for regular, small transfers of cash through Western Union from a city in the industrial north of England. The sender identified himself as a “half brother”.A letterThe other thing was a letter. It was handwritten on fragile, blue airmail stationery and sent in 2006. It was cranky yet intimate, conveying both annoyance and concern, a letter that could only have been written by a relative.“I am in so much pain that I cannot go to the toilet even,” the writer began, and, after an extensive catalogue of physical ailments, went on to complain about the burden of providing continuous financial support for Wilayat and her children. He was obviously not a rich man.“For God’s sake, try to sort yourselves out financially, in case anything goes wrong with me,” the writer told them, appending information for the latest Western Union transfer. “May God help us all.” The letter was signed “Shahid”, and it was sent from an address in Bradford, Yorkshire.Let us pause, for a moment, to consider the tragedy of the house of Oudh. In the mid-19th century, the British East India Co had accelerated its consumption of Indian kingdoms. Having guzzled Punjab and Sindh, it set its ambitions on Oudh, a territory roughly the size of South Carolina.Oudh was ruled at the time by a nawab, or provincial governor, named Wajid Ali Shah, a dreamy aesthete who spent his time orchestrating lavish entertainments in a harem that he called the Parikhana, or “abode of fairies”. He thought the British were his allies, because his great-uncle had extended them vast loans.The British thought otherwise. They stripped the nawab of his kingdom on the grounds of mismanagement, thrusting into his hands a treaty declaring that “the territories of Oude shall be henceforth vested for ever, in the Honorable East India Company”.The nawab wept, solemnly removed his turban and placed it in the envoy’s hands. Soon thereafter, he set off for exile in Calcutta, and Lucknow was cast into mourning, the historian Rosie Llewellyn-Jones recalls in her biography of Wajid Ali Shah.“The body of the town was left soulless,” Zahuruddin Bilgrami wrote at that time. “Grief rained down from every door and wall. There was no lane, bazaar, or dwelling which did not wail in our full agony of separation.”The nawab’s mother, in seclusion, sailed to Britain in a desperate attempt to plead her case with Queen Victoria, something the wags at Punch magazine found hilarious:The Queen of Oude Is disendowed Of regions rich and juicy Their milk and honey I mean their money Squeezed out by Lord Dalhousie Oudh was finished. The vanished kingdom would hang over Lucknow like a pall.Haunted cityI returned to Lucknow, and took a cab to a warren of residential streets tucked behind the grand shrines and palaces of the old city.This is where I had encountered witnesses who could remember Cyrus and his family. Horses pulled carts through the narrow lanes, and I could hear tinny music playing on a radio. Nostalgia for Oudh was a cottage industry here. Everywhere I went, I saw the image of the last nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, his expression dreamy, one nipple poking out of his shirt.Then there were the descendants. Because Wajid Ali Shah had hundreds of wives and concubines, people identifying themselves as descendants are all over the place in Lucknow, fighting like polecats over the veracity of one another’s claims.When I asked about the family, I encountered instant recognition: Yes, three of them had moved into this complex for a few months in the 1970s. Abrar Hussain, who had worked for Wilayat as a servant, said the family had caused a sensation, especially among Shias. Ordinary people were moved to tears at the sight of them, and some were so awed by the begum – so convinced that she was their returning queen – that they refused to turn their backs to her, walking backward, out of respect.“It wasn’t just me – the whole public was coming to see her, and was going crazy,” he said. “People would cry to see her in this condition.”But the older men who presided over the neighbourhood, mostly descendants of members of the nawab’s court, said the family were impostors. Sayyed Suleiman Naqvi, a former code-breaker for the Indian army, said he had posed as a journalist in order to check Wilayat’s credentials.“She said, ‘We have got documentary evidence.’ I said, ‘Get it.’ She said, ‘I will give it only to those persons who are in authority.’ She showed us certain pieces of crockery and all that, which were of course antiques,” recalled Naqvi, now in his late 70s. “But she did not show us any documents.”The family left Lucknow abruptly, he said. Something had happened: An elderly aunt said she recognised Wilayat from before Partition. The aunt said Wilayat was an ordinary woman then, the young wife of a civil servant. Naqvi, who considers himself a keen student of human nature, said he believed they were frauds, but that they were not motivated by greed.“To my mind, this lady was a megalomaniac,” he said finally. “She should have been psychologically tested.”His assessment of her children, however, was quite different. “They believed their mother,” he said, “because she was their mother.”Everything I had learned in India was fragmentary, neighbourhood gossip unbottled after 40 years.To YorkshireI returned to London with three real leads. The airmail letter from Yorkshire. That name, Shahid. The Western Union receipts, testament that someone had been caring for Cyrus and his family in secret all these years. I took a train to Bradford, and walked to the address on the envelope. It was a gray, windblown day, and the walk took me past pawnshops, cheap Chinese takeout joints and dinky row houses of yellow brick, nearly all of them occupied by immigrants from India and Pakistan.I arrived, finally, at a small, neat brick house that was surrounded by a large collection of ceramic garden gnomes, teddy bears, Yorkies, mermaids and fairies. I was so nervous that I paced in front of the house for a while before ringing the bell. The door swung open, and before me stood a man in tiger-print pyjamas.He was barrel-chested and broad-shouldered, and looked to be in his mid-80s. He did not look well: His eyes were rheumy, his chest sunken. But he had Cyrus’s face, the same jutting cheekbones and hawk nose.He led me inside, showed me to a chair and then lay down on a cot. His movements were laborious. He glanced without expression at the photographs I had brought with me. When I offered to play him a recording of Cyrus’s voice, he shook his head in refusal, saying it would be too painful.Beside his sickbed were two framed pictures of Wilayat. This was Shahid. He was Cyrus’s older brother. And now, finally, there were some facts.They were, or had been, an ordinary family. Their father had been the registrar of Lucknow University, Inayatullah Butt. My friend’s name was not Prince Cyrus, or Prince Ali Raza, or Prince anything. He was plain old Mickey Butt. Here, in this brick house in West Yorkshire, I had found it: The identity that Cyrus and his family had worked so hard to keep secret.Shahid, who spent his adult life working in an iron foundry, could remember a life before Oudh, when they had housemaids and school uniforms. When their mother was not a rebel queen, but a housewife.Before long, Shahid’s wife, Camellia, came home. She was a friendly, plain-spoken Lancashire woman, animated on the subject of the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn (whom she despised), and her husband (whom she adored.) The two of them met in 1968, when she wore her hair in a blond beehive and Shahid was built like a heavyweight boxer in those days, she said, dreamily, he could fight four men at once.She never met her husband’s mother, but had corresponded with her for years. She thought the story about Oudh was, as she put it, “a bloody big act”. “What was wrong with this woman?” she said of Wilayat. “I believed every word of it at the beginning, but now I doubt all of it. It’s very hard to get Shahid to talk about it. I think it’s painful. I think he was led to believe it was true. Then, as he got older, he realised it was all built on sand.”Shahid ran away when he was about 14, then emigrated to Britain and rarely mentioned his mother’s claim to the royal house of Oudh. When I asked him about that story, he was evasive. He said he wasn’t even sure whether he was Indian or Pakistani.“I’m so confused, I don’t know who I am,” he said. “I am like a bird, a long lost bird, a lost lamb.”I kept asking questions but Shahid was preoccupied by the news of Cyrus’s death – he called him Mickey – and that no one knew exactly where he was buried.“I should have saved him,” he said.Now, all of a sudden, the field of witnesses had expanded. There were other relatives, respectable people, scattered across Pakistan, Britain and the United States. Cyrus’s oldest brother, Salahuddin Zahid Butt, was a pilot in the Pakistani air force, a war hero who bombed Indian positions in the 1965 war. He died in 2017, but his wife, Salma, lived in Texas.I called her. She said her mother-in-law’s claim to royal descent was false. “She thought she was the princess of Oudh, but this was never, ever,” she said of Wilayat. “We never heard this history about the princess of this, the princess of that. She obviously had some mental disorder.”LahoreTwo of Cyrus’s older cousins, Wahida and Khalida, were still in Lahore, so I flew to Pakistan to see them. I parked beside an open sewer full of black, seething water, and walked down a trash-choked alleyway and knocked on a wooden door. It opened into a spacious compound, eerily quiet and green, with rosebushes in bloom.The cousins were hunched, birdlike women in their 70s. Wahida had worked for many years as a teacher, and barely spoke. She seemed to communicate by slapping people, hard, across the face. She wandered from one of us to the other, looking for someone to slap. Once, it was me. Mostly it was my interpreter, whose face hardened into a permanent wince. Khalida did most of the talking.She remembered Wilayat as a tempestuous young woman, but said they hadn’t seen her since the late 1960s, when she suddenly left Pakistan and returned to India. They seemed unwilling to say anything further. After listening to them discuss other subjects for an hour, I pressed the issue, conscious of the passage of time.“Ask her, did you ever hear that your family was related to the royal nawabs of Oudh?” I relayed to my interpreter. “I have no idea,” Khalida answered.“Wilayat said she was the queen of Oudh,” I told them. “She told the Indian government that for many, many years.”I prodded them for hours, until I was tired and frustrated.“Wilayat is dead,” I said. “Her children are dead. There is no secret anymore.”“Everything is a lie,” Khalida said. “They are dead. Just leave them. God forgives them, so we should also forgive them.”Trying to get Shahid to speak about his mother and siblings was painful. He would get stuck at a particular moment in the story, when his mother sent him out to buy bananas and he fled the family. Camellia said that, to this day, he would not eat bananas. She thought it was guilt. Besides, he was becoming sicker and sicker.It wasn’t a chest infection, but lung cancer that had metastasised to his lymph nodes. Camellia would not think of allowing him to be admitted to the hospital, but nursed him in the front room until there was nothing to do but give him painkillers.On my fourth visit to Bradford, the last time I saw him, his voice was raspy, but he told me more than he ever had before. The story, as he told it, began at Partition.On June 3rd, 1947, the British viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, announced that the withdrawal of British Empire would create two independent nations, with Pakistan carved out for Muslims. Lucknow’s educated Muslims began slipping away overnight, headed for Pakistan’s new capital, where they would make up the DNA of a new elite. There were letters promising juicy promotions. And there were, on the other hand, rumours of violence if they stayed.Shahid’s parents had to make an immediate decision between India or Pakistan. His mother, Wilayat Butt, had never been so happy as she was in Lucknow. She was fiery and strong. Shahid has an image of her, striding out onto her balcony in Lucknow in jodhpurs and riding boots, slapping her thigh with a crop. She simply refused to leave.But then came one afternoon in the crumbling elegance of the nawab’s city. Shahid’s father – a man in distinguished middle age, wearing wire-rimmed glasses – was riding his bicycle home when he was surrounded by Hindu youths, who began beating him with hockey sticks.Bathed in bloodHe soon decided to move the whole family to Pakistan, where, in the great reshuffling, he had been offered a job overseeing the new country’s civil aviation agency. He was right to worry over the months that followed, the city of his youth, Lahore, would be bathed in blood.“We were children,” recalled Salma, Wilayat’s daughter-in-law. “Riots were on, and we couldn’t go out at all. Weeks and weeks, the dead bodies were lying around, and when we went to the bazaar to get our food there was so much rioting and robbing, people were robbing. At night it would be very frightening, you could hear people crying and shooting and stabbing. We would be sitting next to the window and watching.”Wilayat followed her husband, Shahid told me, but she never accepted his decision to leave India. She was obsessed with what she had left behind. In her mind, the grudge sprouted and germinated, and her behaviour became volatile. Then her husband suddenly died. Now with all restraining influence on her gone, furious over the expropriation of her property, she accosted Pakistan’s prime minister at a public appearance, Shahid said, and slapped him.This changed things for Wilayat. She was no longer a well-connected widow, but something shadier. She was confined to a mental hospital in Lahore for six months after that – the only way, Shahid said, to avoid a long prison sentence. Shahid remembers visiting her there, among the wails and curses of the patients.“It was horrible,” he said. “Women tied up with chains. One poor girl was chained up to a wall. It was four chains. And she was swinging. And spitting at everybody who went past.”Salma said that Wilayat was given electroshock therapy. “They said she was mental,” she said. “They gave her all these injections.”When she was free, Wilayat gathered up her youngest children without warning, packed trunks with carpets and jewellery, and smuggled it all back into India, with the goal of reclaiming her property. Shahid set out with them but eventually walked away. He could not put into words why he left. His story flickers out here.Early this month, Shahid died in the front room of his house, holding Camellia’s hand. It was Partition that ruined his mother, set her on the course toward the ruined palace, Shahid had told me.“We had to start all over again,” he said.In the early 1970s, still empty-handed, increasingly bizarre in her behaviour, Wilayat announced to the world that she was the queen of Oudh, demanding the vast properties of a kingdom that no longer existed. An ordinary grievance, unaddressed, had metastasised to become an epic one.They took on new identities: Farhad became Princess Sakina, occasionally Princess Alexandrina Mickey became Prince Ali Raza, and later called himself Prince Cyrus. They no longer made any mention of their Pakistani relatives, or the spacious family house in Lahore that was waiting for them should they return. Maybe they forgot it existed. They seemed to shed their past entirely, to come from nowhere.The rest of the story you already know. They were so convincing, and so insistent, that for 40 years people believed them. So there it is: I have plundered their secret.Cyrus would have hated it. He refused to answer questions about his past it was one of the essential themes of our friendship. I try to imagine how he would react to all this. His father on his bicycle, being beaten with hockey sticks. His mother in a mental hospital where women were chained to the wall. His older brother running away, abandoning him. Mickey Butt, the name he had left behind.There is no nice way to put this. I am unravelling the story that was the central work of their lives. It is impossible to know, now that he and his sister are dead, whether they even knew it wasn’t all true. Either way, this article would have crushed him. And yet, why do you invite a journalist into your life, if you do not expect this to happen? That is like asking a dog not to bark.I must admit, it offends me a little when people think they can lie to reporters. But even today there are plenty of autorickshaw drivers in Old Delhi who will tell you about the prince who lived in the jungle. And they will be telling that story long after mine has come and gone.I was reminded of this on my last trip to Delhi. I visited the cemetery where Cyrus is buried. I had an idea of placing a stone there, something that said Prince Cyrus of Oudh. But he had been buried as an unclaimed body, assigned the number DD33B. Unclaimed bodies are marked only with chips of stone, and small mounds extend in all directions, to the vanishing point. After wandering the cemetery for what seemed like hours, I sat down, sweaty and miserable.“He is lost in a city of the dead,” I wrote in my notebook.The strangerMy colleague Suhasini was haranguing the clerk, urging him to look through his ledger one more time, when I realised that a man was warming himself beside a stove, listening intently. He then stood up and presented himself, rather formally.He was Mohammad Aslam Chowdhury, a seller of electrical wiring from Old Delhi. He was wearing a voluminous, cheap-looking tweed jacket, and had a squiff of hair, dyed jet black. He presented a plastic folder and showed me its contents. It was filled with newspaper clippings about Cyrus’s death.He said he carried the clippings to remind himself how swiftly earthly glory passes. “In Old Delhi, this was the only topic of conversation,” he said. “People were saying such a big king passed away like this, in such a way that nobody knew him. How could the scion of such an illustrious royal family get lost in the darkness of oblivion?”As he spoke of Cyrus’s death, Chowdhury became distressed. “I feel really emotional about this, that something like this can happen on an Earth made by God,” he cried out, as the other people in the clerk’s office turned to stare. “O destiny, tell me why you are angry with me. What I have done wrong?”I glanced incredulously at my interpreter: Could this really be happening? But Chowdhury was in his own world. The story of the royals of Oudh had sounded a note within him. He would be telling the story for years, I realised.“If a person like this has gone into oblivion, and had this death of anonymity,” he said, wonderingly, “what can you say about the death of a commoner?” – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019matt cartoon dec 1","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Typhoon poses another threat to Southeast Asian GamesGeneral election 2019: Robert Buckland says some offenders are not ‘capable of rehabilitation’ - latest newsLondon Bridge terror attack: Vigil for victims Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt - watch liveWoman survives 12 nights in Australian outback as search continues for two friendsThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayA guide to postal votes and proxy votes for the 2019 general electionHow to vote in the 2019 general election Momentum behind Lib Dems being lost as party set to win only handful of seats in the general electionWhale dies with 100kg \u0026#39litter ball\u0026#39 including plastic bags and cups in its stomachArmed with a Narwhal tusk and a fire extinguisher: the heroes who took on the terroristThe 41 Brexit-backing seats that the Conservative Party election campaign will targetWho will win Strictly Come Dancing 2019?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMany of the features will sound familiar to people who have already used one of Bó’s competitors.\u0026nbspUsers can analyse all of their spending by retailer, category and location, put\u0026nbspmoney aside in a “piggy bank”\u0026nbspand set goals.Curiously, however, the app is not yet linked up to the Bacs payment system so it will not allow customers to set up direct debits or have their salary paid into their Bó account.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cyclists make their way up a tree lined hill near to Moor Crichel in Dorset.

RBS and Santander customers endured the most IT glitches last year with both banks suffering 18 failures, according to the research.Mark Bailie, chief executive of Bó, said: “In this digital, contactless age, people need support managing their money more than ever. It is all too easy to lose control. Our data suggests that three quarters of people in the UK are living financially unsustainable lives. We want to help change this.“We are launching Bó to help people build the habits and routines that will allow them do money better day-by-day and week-after-week so they can fund their lives and lifestyles in a more sustainable way.“As we’re part of NatWest, people can rely on Bó to keep their money safe.While app-only banks have grown their user numbers rapidly, they have yet to become profitable.

You don’t treat girls like that. Leave her alone, you turds!”Created with Sketch.18 of the greatest gigs ever – according to our critics Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience.

(Elisa Bray)John’s outburst was met with laughter and cheers from the audience.Today Perth presenter Louise Momber told the Sydney Morning Herald: “He was so angry. He said he can’t stand violence against women and had to say something. He sang the next song and then immediately apologised for his rant – but said it’s something he’s really passionate about.”John is currently on the fourth leg of his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, which began in September 2018 and is due to wrap up with three nights at London’s O2 Arena in December 2020.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell.

(AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMany of the features will sound familiar to people who have already used one of Bó’s competitors.\u0026nbspUsers can analyse all of their spending by retailer, category and location, put\u0026nbspmoney aside in a “piggy bank”\u0026nbspand set goals.Curiously, however, the app is not yet linked up to the Bacs payment system so it will not allow customers to set up direct debits or have their salary paid into their Bó account.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cyclists make their way up a tree lined hill near to Moor Crichel in Dorset.

RBS and Santander customers endured the most IT glitches last year with both banks suffering 18 failures, according to the research.Mark Bailie, chief executive of Bó, said: “In this digital, contactless age, people need support managing their money more than ever. It is all too easy to lose control. Our data suggests that three quarters of people in the UK are living financially unsustainable lives. We want to help change this.“We are launching Bó to help people build the habits and routines that will allow them do money better day-by-day and week-after-week so they can fund their lives and lifestyles in a more sustainable way.“As we’re part of NatWest, people can rely on Bó to keep their money safe.While app-only banks have grown their user numbers rapidly, they have yet to become profitable.

Once Upon a Time in HollywoodA helter-skelter ride of a movie, satirical, very witty and showing its director’s immense affection for the B-movie actors, stunt men and hangers on who make up its cast. It’s also a tribute to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Who would have believed that a film set just as the Sixties in LA turned sour could be so uplifting? Geoffrey MacnabThe world isn’t scared enough of Scientology, but perhaps itClarisse LoughreyScorsese summons all his sad captains for one last reunion in his magisterial gangster epic. De Niro, Pesci, Keitel and (newcomer) Pacino are all cast in a film as much about friendship, memory and betrayal as it is about corruption in the Teamster union or Mafia violence. GMThis is Pixar’s boldest and strangest animated feature. It takes us deep inside the mind of its heroine, 11-year-old Riley, where her unconscious is shown as akin to a magical theme park emotions like Joy and Sadness feature as characters. Director Pete Docter deals with complex subject matter in a lithe and inventive way, and without too many Freudian hang ups. GMHirokazu Kore-eda is like the Charles Dickens of contemporary Japanese cinema. He tells melodramatic family stories which would seem mawkish if they weren’t so brilliantly observed. Winner of the Palme D’Or in Cannes, this is one of his very best movies – a heart-tugging story about impoverished members of a makeshift family doing everything they can to survive. GMDogtooth is a grim tale of isolation, incest, cat murder andGM741 34. Edge of SeventeenKelly Fremon Craig’s gorgeous if cruelly unrecognised The Edge of Seventeen is deliberately small in plot, with Hailee Steinfeld playing a grumpy teen horrified to discover her best friend is dating her older brother. But it is told with heartwarming urgency, reflective of the heightened, dizzying drama of merely being a teenager.Reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson, who published only a handful of poems during her lifetime, is brought to life in vivid fashion by actress Cynthia Nixon in Terence Davies’s biopic. She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie. It’s a wilderness tale on the very grandest scale. From the opening massacre to the snowbound denouement, it if full of moments that startle you with their violence and their beauty. GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney. GMThe horrors of Ari Aster’s occult contraption are matchedKirsten Dunst is remarkable as a bride in the grips ofAWSelma is a masterclass in the historical biopic. Presenting aCLTaika Waititi’s films always end with the feeling that thingsCLBritish stoicism and grace under-fire are foregrounded in Christopher Nolan’s epic film about the Dunkirk evacuations. Nolan has a Cecil B De Mille-like genius for orchestrating crowd scenes and working with huge ensemble casts. He combines spectacle with very intimate moments that show the quiet desperation of the soldiers stranded on a French beach with little chance of escape.AW1841 23. Call Me by Your NameLuca Guadagnino’s wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama, set over a long, lazy Italian summer sometime in the 1980s, is notable for its frank but delicately observed account of the love affair between the precocious adolescent Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and the American academic, Oliver (Armie Hammer), who becomes part of the household. GM It may be animated but few live-action films have captured middle-aged male angst and disillusionment as well as Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa. David Thewlis’s exceptional voice work brings an extra, sardonic edge to its portrayal of the businessman on a work trip to Cincinnati. Kaufman captures the man’s vulnerability, boredom and creeping disappointment about the course his life has taken. GMDescribed upon release as a lightly fictionalised accountAWIt’s important to occasionally remind yourself thatAWRoma takes two stories – one heartwrenching and intimate, the other sweeping and political – and weaves them together so delicately that they become one. It’s a tribute to the domestic worker who director Alfonso Cuarón says raised him. But it’s also the story of Mexico’s history, as seen through the perspective of those who have, for so long, been left voiceless. This is Cuarón’s masterpiece. CL2341 18. The Act of KillingIt feels remarkable, given how easy it is to turn away from evil,CLPark Chan-Wook’s twisted homage to Hitchcock’s Shadow of a DoubtCLLike Ken Loach’s Kes, Clio Barnard’s Bradford-set tale, very loosely inspired by the Oscar Wilde story, combines lyricism with polemic. It captures brilliantly the mischief and resourcefulness of its two young protagonists (teenage kids excluded from school) while laying bare the brutality of the society in which they and their families are cast adrift. GM2641 15. Son of SaulIn \u0027Son of Saul\u0027 Geza Rohrig plays a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner tasked with the extermination of his fellow JewsLady Bird – and its story of a frustrated teen (Saoirse Ronan)AWWes Anderson’s kitsch yarn, largely set in a luxurious spa hotel just before the Second World War, is an elegy for a lost world. Whether it’s Alexandre Desplat’s music, the eye-popping colours or the mannered but brilliant performances, all the elements here are perfectly judged. A film that could easily have seemed flimsy and conceited is instead utterly enrapturing. GMSteve McQueen’s harrowing period drama confronts audiences with the reality of slavery. Racist white owners treat their slaves as if they’re livestock, not human beings. Chiwetel Ejiofor excels as Solomon Northup, the free man sold into slavery. The film has a furious polemical charge but also works as a terrifying Kafkaesque drama about a man who falls off the face of the world. GM3141 11. Under the SkinScarlett Johansson tucking nervously into a slice ofAW20th Century Women is a small-scale comedy drama with the power of something bigger. A tapestry of restless lives figuring things out, it is about family, longing and feeling out of place.

In its story ofAWGet Out sunk its teeth into culture in 2017, and hasn’t stopped biting. Jordan Peele’s horror satire is a polished, spooky and supremely well-executed chiller, but works even better as a deconstruction of race. In its sights are peak white centrism, the burdens and expectations of being black in America, and the untruths of the post-racial utopia many were fooled into embracing in the Obama era. No other film has reflected society in the 21st century more succinctly.

Once Upon a Time in HollywoodA helter-skelter ride of a movie, satirical, very witty and showing its director’s immense affection for the B-movie actors, stunt men and hangers on who make up its cast. It’s also a tribute to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Who would have believed that a film set just as the Sixties in LA turned sour could be so uplifting? Geoffrey MacnabThe world isn’t scared enough of Scientology, but perhaps itClarisse LoughreyScorsese summons all his sad captains for one last reunion in his magisterial gangster epic. De Niro, Pesci, Keitel and (newcomer) Pacino are all cast in a film as much about friendship, memory and betrayal as it is about corruption in the Teamster union or Mafia violence. GMThis is Pixar’s boldest and strangest animated feature. It takes us deep inside the mind of its heroine, 11-year-old Riley, where her unconscious is shown as akin to a magical theme park emotions like Joy and Sadness feature as characters. Director Pete Docter deals with complex subject matter in a lithe and inventive way, and without too many Freudian hang ups. GMHirokazu Kore-eda is like the Charles Dickens of contemporary Japanese cinema. He tells melodramatic family stories which would seem mawkish if they weren’t so brilliantly observed. Winner of the Palme D’Or in Cannes, this is one of his very best movies – a heart-tugging story about impoverished members of a makeshift family doing everything they can to survive. GMDogtooth is a grim tale of isolation, incest, cat murder andGM741 34. Edge of SeventeenKelly Fremon Craig’s gorgeous if cruelly unrecognised The Edge of Seventeen is deliberately small in plot, with Hailee Steinfeld playing a grumpy teen horrified to discover her best friend is dating her older brother. But it is told with heartwarming urgency, reflective of the heightened, dizzying drama of merely being a teenager.Reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson, who published only a handful of poems during her lifetime, is brought to life in vivid fashion by actress Cynthia Nixon in Terence Davies’s biopic. She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie. It’s a wilderness tale on the very grandest scale. From the opening massacre to the snowbound denouement, it if full of moments that startle you with their violence and their beauty. GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney. GMThe horrors of Ari Aster’s occult contraption are matchedKirsten Dunst is remarkable as a bride in the grips ofAWSelma is a masterclass in the historical biopic. Presenting aCLTaika Waititi’s films always end with the feeling that thingsCLBritish stoicism and grace under-fire are foregrounded in Christopher Nolan’s epic film about the Dunkirk evacuations. Nolan has a Cecil B De Mille-like genius for orchestrating crowd scenes and working with huge ensemble casts. He combines spectacle with very intimate moments that show the quiet desperation of the soldiers stranded on a French beach with little chance of escape.AW1841 23. Call Me by Your NameLuca Guadagnino’s wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama, set over a long, lazy Italian summer sometime in the 1980s, is notable for its frank but delicately observed account of the love affair between the precocious adolescent Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and the American academic, Oliver (Armie Hammer), who becomes part of the household. GM It may be animated but few live-action films have captured middle-aged male angst and disillusionment as well as Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa. David Thewlis’s exceptional voice work brings an extra, sardonic edge to its portrayal of the businessman on a work trip to Cincinnati. Kaufman captures the man’s vulnerability, boredom and creeping disappointment about the course his life has taken. GMDescribed upon release as a lightly fictionalised accountAWIt’s important to occasionally remind yourself thatAWRoma takes two stories – one heartwrenching and intimate, the other sweeping and political – and weaves them together so delicately that they become one. It’s a tribute to the domestic worker who director Alfonso Cuarón says raised him. But it’s also the story of Mexico’s history, as seen through the perspective of those who have, for so long, been left voiceless. This is Cuarón’s masterpiece. CL2341 18. The Act of KillingIt feels remarkable, given how easy it is to turn away from evil,CLPark Chan-Wook’s twisted homage to Hitchcock’s Shadow of a DoubtCLLike Ken Loach’s Kes, Clio Barnard’s Bradford-set tale, very loosely inspired by the Oscar Wilde story, combines lyricism with polemic. It captures brilliantly the mischief and resourcefulness of its two young protagonists (teenage kids excluded from school) while laying bare the brutality of the society in which they and their families are cast adrift. GM2641 15. Son of SaulIn \u0027Son of Saul\u0027 Geza Rohrig plays a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner tasked with the extermination of his fellow JewsLady Bird – and its story of a frustrated teen (Saoirse Ronan)AWWes Anderson’s kitsch yarn, largely set in a luxurious spa hotel just before the Second World War, is an elegy for a lost world. Whether it’s Alexandre Desplat’s music, the eye-popping colours or the mannered but brilliant performances, all the elements here are perfectly judged. A film that could easily have seemed flimsy and conceited is instead utterly enrapturing. GMSteve McQueen’s harrowing period drama confronts audiences with the reality of slavery. Racist white owners treat their slaves as if they’re livestock, not human beings. Chiwetel Ejiofor excels as Solomon Northup, the free man sold into slavery. The film has a furious polemical charge but also works as a terrifying Kafkaesque drama about a man who falls off the face of the world. GM3141 11. Under the SkinScarlett Johansson tucking nervously into a slice ofAW20th Century Women is a small-scale comedy drama with the power of something bigger. A tapestry of restless lives figuring things out, it is about family, longing and feeling out of place.

In its story ofAWGet Out sunk its teeth into culture in 2017, and hasn’t stopped biting. Jordan Peele’s horror satire is a polished, spooky and supremely well-executed chiller, but works even better as a deconstruction of race. In its sights are peak white centrism, the burdens and expectations of being black in America, and the untruths of the post-racial utopia many were fooled into embracing in the Obama era.

Many seats look impossibly tight.Boris Johnson’s Government is in ­danger — and Brexit with it.The survey predicting his victory may or may not be an accurate snapshot of the current mood. What is certain is the race will now tighten as a direct result.Remainers, sensing defeat, will vote tactically for whichever party can oust the Tory candidate. They will ignore the sickening racism, the lies, the terrorist friends and the economic lunacy of Corbyn’s Labour and back them anyway.Some Tory Remainers may vote Lib-Dem, complacently thinking Boris will win anyway. That may prove fatal.Tories, and all Leave voters, must be resolute. Only a Tory majority will secure Brexit and defeat Corbyn. If you want it, you MUST vote for it.The Brexit Party will not win anywhere. Unless you are a lelong Labour voter who would NEVER vote Tory, ­opting for Nigel Farage over Boris now actively threatens Brexit. Indeed, Mr Farage should urge his ex-Tory voters to back Boris. Because this is not over.Andthe Tories fall agonisingly short, Brexit will be lost and Mr Farage’s party will deserve the blame.HOW can Labour, panicked by the polls, seriously now hope to pass themselves off as a Leave party  They betrayed their Leave voters and everyone knows it.Corbyn wants his Remainer lackey Keir Starmer to “negotiate” a new deal tying us into Brussels’ customs union forever.  That’s Remain in all but name.He would then hold a rigged second referendum pitting this Remain option against actually Remaining in full. His party will campaign for the latter — and give children and EU migrants the vote.Labour are simultaneously posing as a Remain party in the South while trying to masquerade as Leavers in the North.Candidates like Ed Miliband, who have fought ceaselessly to halt Brexit, pretend they voted to make it happen. It is an appalling, jaw-dropping deceit.To Leave you have one option: the Tories.WHY do the Tory-haters of Channel  News think Boris Johnson would bother attending their biased and little-watched debates Their Head of News publicly branded him a liar. Presenter Jon Snow chanted “f*** the Tories” at Glastonbury.Channel  doesn’t want to “scrutinise” the Tories in the public interest. It seeks solely to damage their election chances.TV’s best journalists are inscrutable. We can barely guess how they vote.

They were WRONG. All those Labour toffs thought they could live without all of us thick, ignorant peasants who dared to disobey the establishment and vote for Brexit.Emily Thornberry — Lady Nugee, who chuckled at seeing the flag of  St George! — was wrong. Sir Keir Starmer, so passionate in his adoration of Brussels, was wrong.Corbyn — a man without a patriotic bone in his withered old carcass — was wrong. Labour’s total contempt for the working class, who they were founded to represent, has them stumbling towards defeat.So Labour are rethinking their General Election strategy.In Leave-voting areas, Labour will get down on their knees and beg the working class to come home.Even an unequivocal Remainer like Ed Miliband is pretending he has always fought for a Brexit deal.No, Ed — you fought to keep us in a single market and a customs union. You fought for a Brexit that was unworthy of the name.You fought for a deal that was worse than staying in the EU.Labour should really stop fibbing to the British people.The modern Labour Party has no love, affection or understanding of the working class. It is the Tories who now represent the values of  the working man and woman — their patriotism, their belief in democracy, their belief in family  and hard work.In working-class communities, Labour are ludicrously flexing their non-existent Leave credentials — which is both bitterly ironic and horribly hypocritical.Ask all the decent Labour MPs who have suffered torrents of abuse from Labour’s online thugs for ­daring to suggest that the Referendum result, and democracy itself, should be respected.Labour are the Remain party who are too pathetically gutless to admit it. But this election is not simply about Brexit.Infinitely more important than our relationship with the European Union is stopping an economically moronic, terrorist sympathiser like Corbyn from getting anywhere near  Downing Street.I have only ever been a member of one political party — Labour.It was the party of my family, my neighbourhood and my class.That party no longer exists.Corbyn and his Marxist muppets have ruined Labour with their sickening Jew-baiting racism, their puerile class war, their total lack of understanding of even basic ­economics.Do not let them ruin the country.Do not believe the lies that they are going to tell you over the next  days.Andyou are working class, never believe for a single second that this pathetic excuse for a ­Labour Party is on your side.Labour have thrown in their lot with privately educated revolutionaries who would rather wave a Palestinian flag than the Union Jack.And it is only now they are starting to regret it.TOSSING back her golden tresses, Charlize Theron wears a gold dress against a golden background in an ad for Dior’s J’Adore perfume – which comes in a golden bottle.It is like being buried in an avalanche of Ferrero Rocher chocolates.And that’s a compliment.And because he wasn’t there, he must also have invented the scene where a young Prince Charles sobs because he has been forced to break up with a hot young Camilla.And far more offensively, Morgan is surely making it all up when he depicts the Queen faking a tear as she witnesses the horror of  Aberfan.All the real-le photos of the Queen visiting the tragic Welsh mining village show her looking shocked  beyond belief.I do not believe she faked a tear for the cameras.I enjoy The Crown but it is only a posh EastEnders.Don’t mistake it for anything resembling  historical truth.WHAT happened to Katie Price’s £million fortune Just guessing here – she spent it.I will leave it to others to analyse Katie’s profligacy with money and just say this in her defence.She has been a loving mother to her children, including her blind, autistic son Harvey, now , who she seems to have raised single-handedly.She is an inspiration to any parents raising a disabled child.  She has confronted the evil bullies who have mocked her son.She has been a passionate campaigner to hold social media s to account and make online abuse a criminal offence.I don’t think there is anyone in the country who has been more willing to stand up to bullies than Katie.And now she is bankrupt, owing £, to her creditors.I suspect she has faced bigger battles than bankruptcy.THE Liberal Democrats thought vowing to immediately cancel Brexit when Jo Swinson becomes Prime Minister would be a vote winner.Whoops! Now the Lib Dems are desperately offering a second Referendum.Whoops again!Because millions of us hope we never see another referendum in our letime.Paul has had more barmaids than the Rovers Return.VICTORIA Beckham’s  fashion empire has lost a jaw-dropping £million over  years.So who is doing Victoria’s financial planning Diane Abbott CLIVE James, who has died at the age of , was always the smartest man in the room.I met him a few times over the years but the Australian journalist, broadcaster and wit was best experienced on the page and on TV. That is when you got the full force of his brain, which was the size of a planet.Clive was also that great rarity – a true intellectual who was a laugh.As a TV critic, he brought his savage wit to bear on the nuttiest nooks and crannies of global television. As a writer, he was funny, wise and often deeply moving.When Princess Diana died, Clive wrote an unforgettable eulogy in the New Yorker magazine. It recalled how he met her, how their friendship grew and how, at their last lunch in Kensington Palace with -year-old Prince Harry present, he realised that he was about to be dropped from Diana’s court.“I never saw her again,” James concluded. “Neither will anyone  now.”I loved Clive because he made great writing look easy and he made me laugh.As recently as one week ago, a magazine asked Clive what was bothering him at the moment.“Imminent personal extinction,” he replied.And it is a mark of Clive James’ genius that I can’t imagine anyone  in the world coming out with that hilariously honest quip.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Despite what some of them think, Leave voters aren’t stupid and will see through their attempts to hoodwink them.”Sixteen of the  are Labour MPs seeking re-election, having defied voters in the past three years by voting to block, delay and derail Brexit on numerous occasions.Eight are in very heavy Leave areas where up to  per cent backed Brexit.They include high-profile figures such as the former Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, ex-minister Chris Bryant and former shadow Cabinet member Mary Creagh.In total,  General Election candidates have signed a pledge drawn up by the campaign group Remain Labour.It states: “Labour is committed to a confirmatory referendum, to give you the final say on Brexit. If elected as your Labour MP, I pledge to campaign to Remain in the EU.”By contrast, all  Tory candidates have promised to vote in favour of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.But many Labour hopefuls appear to be going back on their word to deliver the will of the people.Mrs Beckett,  defending her Derby South seat where . per cent voted Leave, had previously insisted she accepted the decision her constituents had made. She declared in May : “We have to make the best of it.”Another, Anna Turley — seeking re-election in Redcar where . per cent voted for Brexit — had said: “I will fight for a Brexit that is fair for Teesside”.Wakefield MP Ms Creagh, who declared before the referendum “ we vote to leave, there’s no going back”, is now of the firm belief there is.Jess Phillips has also signed the Remain Pledge despite assuring Birmingham Yardley voters in : “Sixty-odd per cent of constituents want us to leave. I cannot ignore that.”Labour campaign chiefs will this week launch a last-ditch blitz of “Red Wall” Leave-voting constituencies amid evidence working classes are rallying behind Boris Johnson to save Brexit.They face losing a swathe of seats in the north Midlands and Wales, with the biggest swing to Tories in Leave areas.Labour support in Grimsby, held by the party since , has now collapsed dramatically from  per cent in  to just  per cent.Tony Blair’s former seat of Sedgefield, which has not had a Tory MP since , is on BoJo’s target list.An overwhelming . per cent there voted to Leave and sitting MP Phil Wilson said in : “We respect their decisions and voted accordingly in Parliament in favour of Article .” Yet he has since put his name to the “Remain Pledge”.Ilford North’s Wes Streeting has also changed his stance since he said: “I voted to give the people a choice and I will abide by their decision.” Many Labour candidates who have not signed the pledge have barely tried to hide their derision for Leave voters.Sonya Ward, standing in Mansfield, mocked the . per cent who voted Leave there by claiming they “got it wrong, because they didn’t understand”.Tory chairman James Cleverly said last night: “This is a damning indictment of the very people these candidates want to represent, as well as the .million people who voted to leave in .“Despite pledging to respect the result of the referendum, Labour candidates have turned their backs on Brexit in favour of backing a second referendum and stopping Brexit altogether.”Former Labour leader Ed Miliband, defending the Brexit hotbed of Doncaster North, has not signed the pledge.He has been telling his constituents,   per cent Leave, that he voted for a Brexit deal nine times — but Tories pointed out he voted down Theresa May’s and Boris Johnson’s.His double-dealing exposes the scale of panic in Labour’s northern heartlands.Left-wing activist Owen Jones woke up to the Brexit backlash last week, admitting: “If Labour doesn’t do more to win back Leave voters in the North, Midlands and Wales, then Boris Johnson will win a majority.”One candidate revealed they clocked up  miles knocking on doors in their constituency.The source said: “Walking for six or seven hours a day is taking its toll especially in the cold.“People are picking up injuries and we’ve still got two weeks to go.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And  I understand the desire to let yourself off the leash. But it might be one of the few times you find yourself in the same room as your boss — with a chance to impress or ruin your career.You’ll be well aware we are living in the #MeToo era. And we all know, on occasions, it can go too far and that we shouldn’t all be frightened about exactly what we say and who to say it to.To allay your fears, my advice to you isyou want to dance with a colleague, ask her. If she says no then that’s your answer.Compliments are fine by the way. Us women love them , but think of your sister when giving them out.“You look great in that dress” is something you’d say to your sister, and “you look hot in that dress” isn’t.If you are looking at the month ahead and feeling overwhelmed already, this is really the only advice that you need: Start delegating.Write a list of all the jobs that need to be done and then allocate jobs to everyone over the age of ten.Getting your family to pull their weight is the best way to ensure that everyone has a happy Christmas.I know a lot of people dread the season, partly because they have to spend time with tricky in-laws.You can either not invite them  — why ruin your day   — or invite others too . Or just grin and bear it.Lastly,you are struggling with presents, please allow me to share the rules of our traditional Brady Family Christmas Present Game, played by the  members of our family on Christmas Day.Everyone buys four gts, having set a price limit: We have three at £, one at £.Wrap each one beautully so it’s impossible to distinguish premium from Primark. I once placed a roll of toilet paper with Donald Trump’s face on it in a Chanel gt bag — it was the hotly contended present everyone wanted that year . . . until they opened it.You place all gts on the table then take it in turns to throw a dice. When you get a six you pick anyone present you want . Keep throwing until all gts are distributed.Then throw six rounds with two dice and for every six you get you can pinch a present from anyone’s pile.And when it’s done you keep and open the presents you have won. It keeps us occupied for hours.I LOVED the photos of Kelly Brook in the Bahamas, where she is celebrating turning . What a great advert she is for the idea that le begins at !Kelly is naturally beautul with a big smile – and I think she looks absolutely amazing.“Lord Sugar couldn’t relate to me. That was the fundamental problem.“And I started getting that feeling from about week four.”The problem with interviews like this is that it puts her in danger of sounding a little bit like a sore loser.Oh, and also, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Lord Sugar doesn’t particularly like any of them at the moment.CONGRATULATIONS to builder Steve Thomson, , and his we Lenka, , who scooped the  £million EuroMillions jackpot.All their neighbours have said it couldn’t happen to a nicer couple. And I love the fact that the first thing they want to do with the money is given each of their three kids their own bedroom. This is a fairly humble ambition when you consider they are now one of the biggest British Lottery winners of all time.I also love the fact that Steve said he won’t stop working as a builder and will finish all his jobs before Christmas.He’s also already spelled out to his children thatthey want something “you’ll have to earn it”.All of which reveal an outlook that will stand him in very good stead indeed. It might just mean that he will be able to enjoy his win.The fact is money does change people. It also changes the way others see you. Most families will expect something and when they don’t get it will be angry. They will say things such as “we only want a car . . . it’s not much money for you, but would mean a lot to us”.They will expect you to share out your good fortune.My advice would be to think carefully about what to do with it before you make any rash decisions – and get a very good financial adviser.The problem with people who win a lot of money is that they often totally abandon all their values and spend, spend, spend. Let’s hope Steve and Lenka hold on to theirs.Yes, sure, I can see the temptation to magically get rid of the weight that inevitably comes when you have been, you know, growing another human being inside your body.But she only had a baby six weeks ago and,she waits a bit, she’ll probably just lose the baby weight naturally.In the meantime, yet another celeb demonstrates – and adds to – the pressure to “snap back” to their pre-pregnancy figure within weeks! Yes, your body is important but so is your mind!Six weeks after birth seems too soon to me.EVENit is true that the new Calornian craze of “butt sunning” gives you “surges of energy”, better sleep and “more creativity flowing through le”, which is what one devotee called Meagan promised on a recent Instagram post, I can’t see it catching on here.Meagan  says she has incorporated “perineum sunning” – which involves presenting the area between the anus and vulva to the sun – in to her “daily rising routine”.But talk about the sun shining out of your ar*e…what on earth must the neighbours think.ULRIKA JONSSON is on a dating app for people over   Good for her. She deserves another chance at happiness –  and at  she’s got a lot of le ahead of her.A lot of jokes are made at the expense of Ulrika’s love le and the fact she has had four kids by four men. I can’t help thinking it would be discussed in a dferent wayshe was a man.I KNOW some people are annoyed that Uber will not be granted a new licence to operate in London after repeated safety failures.But I think it’s great news. The reason that the licence hasn’t been granted is because Transport For  London said that the taxi app was not “fit and proper” as a licence holder.I can see the appeal of Uber – but notthe price we are paying is safety.Also, we are lucky enough to live in a country that has the best black cab drivers in the world – who know where they are actually going because they train for up to four years.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Clean surfacesClean surfaces including toilet handles, taps and door handles regularly with disinfectant.. Steer clear of othersAvoid close contact with other people who are sick, or coughing and sneezing a lot.. Wash fruits and cook seafood thoroughlyCarefully wash fruits and vegetables before preparing and eating them and make sure oysters and other shellfish are cooked thoroughly.. Wash laundry wellTry to wash items of clothing with detergent at the maximum available cycleand machine dry themyou can.Research has found that  per cent of office mugs are covered in germs, so rather than using one from the office kitchen, try bringing your own one in and take it home each day to wash properly.Weve all witnessed a colleague leave the bathroom without washing their hands.And it turns out that gross decision may be the reason people in the your office are picking up things like the flu and norovirus.Janky says: Something that is often overlooked is simply to wash your hands regularly, as it helps kill germs.Don’t just wash them after using the toilet, instead make sure you wash them with warm water and soap throughout the day and particularly before eating or after using communal areas.If you look down at your office desk, youll probably notice it doesnt look as spotless as it should do.In fact, dirty desks harbour  times more germs than a toilet seat - which can quickly spread among staff and cause an outbreak of sickness.A study of desks by office supplies firm Viking recently found germs in almost two-thirds of computer keyboards, while some even had mould growing underneath.Phones and desks also had germs, Viking found after analysing swabs sent in by hundreds of office workers.The average desktop harbours , germs per square inch in addition to , on the keyboard and , on a mouse and a staggering , on the phone - far more  germs per inch found on a toilet seat.Janky recommends:It’s worth investing in some antibacterial wipes to clean your desk, keyboard, mouse and phone.If youre too tired youll become much more susceptible to picking up winter bugs.Janky says: Rest is so important and making sure you’re getting enough hours of sleep a night can help reduce daily stress levels and strengthen your immune system.Allowing yourself to become run down means your body isn’t as capable of fighting off infection, so there’s no excuse to not put your feet up and relax.In order to maximise your chances of not getting the flu, doctors are urging people to get vaccinated against the flu virus.Janky says: Get vaccinated against the flu virus as it is the most effective step you can take.Children aged two and three years will be given the vaccine at their general practice - usually by the practice nurse.Young kids in school years one to three are likely to receive their vaccine at school.Pregnant women and anyone aged  and older are also eligible for a free jab.People with long-term heart or respiratory diseases or weakened immune systems will also get a free jab.The vaccine for the over-s has an extra ingredient to boost immune systems.A jab which protects against four rather than three strains will be given to others at risk.Soyoure not in the above groups you can pay for a flu jab at certain stores.Superdrug is offering jabs at £. for non-members.Lloyds Pharmacy is also offering the vaccine fo £. - and you dont have to make an appointment.Boots, Tesco, Asda and Sainsburys all offer jabs which can cost up to £.If you’re entitled to a free NHS flu jab this can be administered at your local Boots pharmacy in England and Wales, as well as through your GP.People living in Scotland and Northern Ireland can,eligible, get the free NHS flu jab through their GP.Customers aged  years and above can also access the private Boots Winter Flu Jab Service.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If she looks exactly like Holby City’s uptight heart consultant Jac Naylor – the character she’s played for the past  years – it’s because she’s stepped straight off the set and into BBC Elstree’s scruffy backstage green room meeting us between scenes. Thankfully, unlike the frosty-faced, hard-as-nails doc who viewers have grown to love, the real Rosie is warm and open, greeting us with a hug. She sips from a water bottle and has one of those immaculate complexions that suggests she downs two litres of the stuff a day. ‘I can assure you I don’t,’ laughs the actor, who lives with second husband Ben Stacey, a gym owner, their five-year-old daughter, Beau, and their four dogs in St Albans. ‘I’m wearing a lot of make-up! I haven’t resorted to Botox yet, but I’m looking forward to it!’ Settling down on the sofa for a natter, Rosie explains how filming Jac’s harrowing nervous breakdown scene, which airs this week, was traumatic because it mirrored her own le three years ago, when she crashed out with depression, anxiety and depersonalisation disorder. Given your mental health struggles, was it emotional, acting Jac’s breakdown  It was the hardest thing I’ve done in my le. When I was first approached about the storyline, I wasn’t happy at all. In fact, I was frightened. But after a lot of cajoling from my agent and the producers, and talking with my husband, I decided it was an important story to tell on behalf of other working mothers. Can you tell us about your own breakdown  Like many first-time mums, I was overwhelmed. Six months after having a baby by C-section, I ed to working long days and I wasn’t being healthy. Scripts were coming in very late and none of what I was reading made sense. One day, I just lost it and shouted at people that they were stopping me from seeing my kid and having a le. A director marched me off set, I called my doctor and I was signed off work immediately.  What were you eventually diagnosed with  Stress, anxiety and depersonalisation disorder – that means you don’t feel like you’re in your own body, you don’t recognise yourself. I remember going home, getting into my pyjamas and looking down on myself asfrom a dferent part of the room. In that moment, I decided everyone would be better off without me. I walked out of the house, without my phone or anything, with no intention of coming back. I turned up at my friend’s house having no idea how I got there. It was pretty scary. How did you get better  I found a therapist. I was reluctant at first because, in all honesty, I saw it as a sign of weakness. My siblings and I were all brought up to be strong iniduals. My mother left when I was very young and we learnt to look after ourselves. I’m a very strong person on the outside. But that all caught up with me.  It’s brave to open up, though... I don’t like people to see I’m vulnerable, but by putting my struggles out there, I hope to help people. All the comments I’ve received have been positive, which is rewarding. Let’s face it, the rest of what I do is just telly, isn’t it  I spent a lot of my childhood wanting people to like me. But I’ve given up on that –you don’t like me that’s fine. I’m  and I finally like myself. How much of your own experience did you bring to your breakdown scenes  Everything. I had a say in the scripts and was allowed a day a week for therapy. I absolutely needed to talk it out, after putting myself back in a vulnerable position. I found it very distressing, watching the scene back where Jac totally loses it in front of her daughter and needs restraining, as did my husband. I still get anxiety about it. I was in a really tired, dark place at the end of filming, so I took three weeks off. I slept a lot and did normal things: I took my kid to school, I walked my dogs, I cleaned my house, I cooked for my family – all the things I really enjoy. If I weren’t at Holby, I would absolutely be a housewe!  How do you stay mentally strong now  Therapy will always be part of my le. I’m lucky enough to be able to afford it. I meditate for  minutes every day and haven’t drunk alcohol in two years. I really miss a lovely glass of red wine, but it’s not good for my mental health. How are your other health issues  You’ve battled endometriosis, haemophilia, the inflammatory disease Behcet’s, and cervical cancer  I’m a bit of a mess, aren’t I  I’ll be on immunosuppressants my whole le. I do feel terribly sorry for myself some days and I sit and cry, but I pick myself up. I’ve got a strong personality and, as an ill person, I don’t like to be told I can’t do things. I enjoy a challenge – I’d love to do something like … and would be horribly competitive. But I’m such an animal lover, I’m not sure how I would manage eating kangaroo balls!    Is Ben very supportive  He knows me better than anyone  and has seen parts of me no one  has. He’s seen me walk out in the middle of the night and not come back, and seen me not being safe to be around my daughter – not that I would ever have been a risk to her, but I was just in such a bad place. And he’s the person who says to me, ‘You need to see your therapist.’ He spots it in me before I do. He’s very good. I know when he’s stressed because he throws himself into a workout.  Do people sometimes think you’re a real doctor  My grandmother would often show me a mark on her arm, asking, ‘What do you think it is ’ I’d keep telling her, ‘I don’t know. I’m not actually a doctor.’ Once a girl fainted right in front of me and someone shouted, ‘Help her!’ and I shouted back, ‘I don’t know what I’m doing!’ What’s the weirdest place you’ve been asked for a selfie  Disneyland. I posed wearing a pair of Mickey Mouse ears, embarrassing! How will you spend Christmas this year  We have friends coming – we’re godparents to their children – and I’ll cook. I can’t stand turkey – it’s too dry for me – so I’ll do a chicken and a proper glazed ham with Yorkshire puds.  The tree won’t last five minutes as we have four dogs – it’ll be chaos! Last year, I went a bit OTT with gts and Beau said halfway through the present-opening, ‘I don’t want to open any more’. I love watching old films with her – Annie, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Elf. Then I’ll take the leftover ham to enjoy with my sister on Boxing Day – she’s over from LA.

He said: “You can’t keep people safe on the cheap.” He was backed by criminologist and former prison officer Ian Acheson, who led a government review of Islamist extremism in prisons and probation. Mr Acheson said: “At the heart of this is the destruction of the prison and probation service through crazy, failed, ideological austerity cuts.” Mr Corbyn also highlighted police cuts that have led to the loss of , officers since . He said: “No government can prevent every attack but it can act to make such acts of terror less rather than more likely. Public services are the glue that binds our society to­­gether – community pol­­icing, the probation service, mental health, youth and social services... When those public services are cut back they leave behind gaps.” He vowed to “do whatever is necessary and effective to keep our people safe”. Mr Corbyn, who opposed UK military action in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, also accused successive British governments – including New Labour – of fuelling the terror threat by waging war abroad. He said: “Their mistakes in no way absolve terrorists of blame for their murderous actions – the blame lies with the terrorists, their funders and recruiters. Butwe are to protect people, we must be honest about what threatens our security. Too often the actions of successive governments have fuelled, not reduced, that threat.”  He also lashed the government for failing to release a report into Saudi funding of extremist groups. He said: “Given Friday’s events and the continuing terror threat, it is simply unacceptable that this report is not in the public domain.” He vowed to “stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen” and again pledged to introduce a War Powers Bill so a prime minister would have to win Parliament’s support for any military action. He was speaking in York on the election trail in North Yorkshire, where he was snapped in Whitby wearing a jacket with the words “for the many not the few” woven into the pinstripe. Mr Corbyn was given a polls boost as several surveys showed the gap narrowing between Labour and the Conservatives.

Claire Wright is tipped by some to win in East Devon, a seat that has traditionally been a safe Conservative constituency. Love Actually star Hugh Grant has urged Labour , Lib Dem and Green voters to back Ms Wright. It comes after the MRP YouGov poll, released last week, said East Devon is likely to elect an Independent. It would be a major blow to the Conservativesthey lose the seat. Ms Wright, who has stood twice before, has seen her share of the vote rise from % in  to % in , and is eyeing up a place in Parliament. It will be an interesting battleground, Devon Live reports , as the Tories lost their district council majority in May after  years. It is now run as a minority administration by Independents. Their poll had Claire Wright on % of the vote, and ranging between % and % - just six points behind Tory candidate Simon Jupp. Ms Wright, , said: “The past few years have demonstrated that the party system is broken. “It is time for change. As an Independent, I would have exactly the same rights as other MPs and would work cross-party to achieve my manesto pledges. “I am dferent. I have no party whip to tell me how to vote. I am free to speak and free to act. And free to fight for the issues that the people of East Devon care about the most. “This election is very unpredictable and presents a rare opportunity for residents to elect an MP who truly cares and puts them first.” Former broadcaster Mr Jupp, , thinks dferently. He said: “I was expecting it to be a bit more dficult and to face a lot of opposition but people just saying to me that they want to get on with it. “I know it is what you would expect me to say, but people are telling me that they want to get Brexit done. I voted to remain, but I back Boris’s Brexit deal, it’s a fantastic deal for this country to move forward. Clearly anxious about losing the seat, both Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock have visited the constituency in recent weeks.  Mr Jupp said: “This may traditionally be a safe seat but it is not a safe seat this time around and we will have to fight to win it. “The Conservatives struggled earlier this year, but it is safe to say that the Tory party is in a very dferent position than it was the district council and EU elections. Speaking after a hustings event on Thursday night, Ms Wright said: Political parties should be judged on their records – ten years of grinding austerity in this case. East Devon voters should not be fooled by late apologies and hollow promises when election time comes around. “When faced by the public, the local candidate attempts to position himself as a campaigner against the same cuts over which his party has presided – it just won’t wash. The party pays lip service to the NHS. Actions always speak louder than words.

It was another pathetic performance showing he is unfit to be Prime Minister. Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn rightly said Tory austerity smashed holes in the criminal justice system. It was the Tories who changed the law so dangerous prisoners couldn’t be kept in jail. We owe it to the families of Saskia and Jack to do whatever it takes to save others from a similar fate. Johnson’s political point scoring is the grubbiness of an indecent Tory with no plan to keep us safe.

When I was a kid, I was convinced I was going to be a star, because I was always told I was good in the village productions. And why wouldn’t I be a star  I was  years old, and my brother Chris, then , had been considered talented too, and look what he’d achieved. He was in Coldplay. And really, really famous. I’m the youngest and Chris is the oldest. Our second-oldest brother, Al, is an architect, our sister, Rosie, is a nurse and our other brother, Richard, is in the Army. I’m an actor and my parents say all their children are ‘working towards their potential’. I have two side jobs too, just to keep a bit of money coming in: I’m a kids’-party entertainer and transcribe interviews for people. Of course, my surname is Martin, but I changed it to Wren – after a Pizza Express pizza I’m fond of – when I started acting. There was another Nicola Martin on the acting directory, and I also had this fear people would think, ‘Oh, it’ll be easy for her – Chris can get her work.’ I wanted to do it for myself. As the youngest of five kids, all I ever wanted was for my siblings to think I was fab at everything I did. That’s maybe why I secretly want to be a bit famous – it’s love and validation. But anyone with lots of siblings will know what it feels like to grow up in someone’s shadow, Coldplay or no Coldplay.  There’s always a favourite – although I don’t actually think Chris is the favourite in our family! Growing up, I knew he was talented and, because we had the biggest age gap, there was less rivalry between us. He’d make up silly songs about me and my pet gerbils, and send me funny postcards when he went away. He was my hero and I just absolutely adored him. I was eight when Coldplay got together, and  when Chris met Gwyneth Paltrow. That’s when things got a lot bigger for him.  I was doing quite a bit of acting and thought I was the big cheese of the village. I’d landed the part of Mole in The Wind In The Willows and believed it was my big moment. I was peeping through the curtain and, just as the show started, I saw two people sneak in wearing caps. I realised it was Chris, with this woman I’d met a few weeks earlier backstage at a Coldplay concert. I remember other people being really excited, but the name Gwyneth Paltrow meant nothing to me at my age. I didn’t know she’d appeared in Shakespeare In Love and I genuinely thought, ‘Yeah, she acts, but I bet she never played Mole.’  After the show, I ran backstage, ready for my praise and Chris and Gwyneth were there, surrounded by people, with everyone wanting photos and autographs. I was really confused – why didn’t anyone want my autograph ! In hindsight, I realise that was when I changed from being the deluded little girl who thought she was a huge star to being seen as Chris Martin’s little sister. When Coldplay first started getting big, Chris would say to me, ‘Let’s go out and get recognised!’ It was a fun game we liked to play because it was only ever fans of the band and only a few people. But when Gwyneth arrived it was a totally dferent type of recognition. Paparazzi would wait outside our house and hide in our garden. That wasn’t very nice.  My parents explained I wasn’t to speak to them as they were sneaky. That’s when I realised I didn’t really know who to trust and I started not wanting people knowing Chris was my brother. Chris and Gwyneth lived in London together, but they’d come to the village for Christmas. After my niece, Apple, was born, the press would be waiting outside trying to get a glimpse. Although I wanted to be an actor, I didn’t see Gwyneth as a big star. All I cared about was that she was my brother’s cool girlfriend who showed me affection and was so kind to me. She was awesome. I went to boarding school a year after they met and I tried not to tell anyone Chris was my brother.  Only I was so homesick, she called and spoke to me every single day. We were really close and especially as a younger sister, when your older brother has a cool girlfriend, you love them. I remember in Home Economics we were making woolly hats and I made two. One for Gwyneth and one for my other brother’s girlfriend at the time. I gave it to Gwyneth and remember thinking, ‘I bet she’s going to get papped wearing that hat.’ I never saw her wear it! It was a shit hat, but I’d done her favourite colours. She was very appreciative and sweet when I gave it to her though. Despite the mega-fame in Chris’s le, the rest of the family all lived normally.  I graduated from drama school and went over to LA to visit him. Gwyneth said she’d take me to the Golden Globes. She helped me pick a dress and get ready, and that was the first time I thought, ‘This is absolutely mental.’ There were brilliant actors all around me and I was thinking, ‘When I get home, I’m back to working in a pub.’ People assume I have a lavish lestyle and Chris bankrolls me, but I’d never ask him for anything – he has his own family. We were always taught the value of money. I needed a new bike recently and some friends said, ‘Can’t Chris pay for it ’ No. It’s nice to save up and buy things yourself. But I’m fortunate thatI was down on my luck, I have people who can help.  My dating le has been tricky with a famous brother. A boy dumped me because he was in a band and was worried people would think he was using me to get to Chris. That was really hard for  him , apparently! I broke up with someone recently in the pub and my brother’s song  The Hardest Part  was playing. And, sometimes, I’ll beon a date, snogging, and a Coldplay song will come on. It’s too weird! Of course, there’s part of me that loves it, becausesomeone dumps me, at least they’ll think about me loads afterwards because they’ll hear Coldplay wherever they go!  I used to pretend I hated the band, as I thought that was cooler, but I’m not afraid to admit I love them now. Their music gives me great comfort and I like taking my friends to their gigs, as they’re brilliant live.

Ryan Savage, , was just three when medics warned his parents that he could have as little as two months to live. Following an MRI scan in October , he had been diagnosed with rare childhood cancer neuroblastoma and it was stage four - the most serious. Doctors found a tumour wrapped around Ryanaposs spine and his horried parents were told that his survival rate was just %. Ryan, from Billingham, County Durham, features in a charity Christmas campaign for Neuroblastoma UK and his family hopes his story can raise vital funds for research into the childhood cancer and support others facing the same terrying battle. His mum Lisa said: This year will be the tenth Christmas we’ll have with Ryan that, at one time, I never ever thought we’d have. Every time Christmas comes around, itaposs a precious reminder to our family that another year has passed since Ryan fought this terrible disease twice, and won. My son is my hero, my warrior, my survivor and my inspiration. We don’t know what the future will hold, but he beat neuroblastoma twice, against all the odds. “More funding is needed to invest in research and give more families like mine hope.”  Following Ryanaposs diagnosis he was forced to endure a gruelling year of cancer treatment beginning with immediate chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the majority of the tumours. Afterwards he was in remission. Our world was turned upside-down by a cancer we had never even heard of before, said Lisa. But two years later, doctors found another tumour in his chest and the consultant said it was the worst case that sheaposd ever seen.  The brave youngster again fought against the odds, undergoing years of gruelling chemotherapy and surgeries before Ryan, Lisa, his dad Tim and sister Annie were given the news the cancer had gone. Seeing what Ryan went through, it breaks my heart to think of all those children fighting neuroblastoma this Christmas, said Lisa. Little children simply donapost deserve to be robbed of their precious early years, nor should they have the threat of their cancer ing constantly hanging over them. But there is still so much more research that needs to be done to prevent children suffering like Ryan did.

Generations of intermarriage secured the Habsburg dynastyaposs dominance over a vast European empire encompassing Austria and Spain for more than two centuries. However it also led to its decline when Charles II, the final Habsburg monarch, was unable to produce an heir. Until now, no research has been able to confirm that the Habsburgsapos distinct chin was a result of inbreeding. Study leader Professor Roman Vilas said: The Habsburg dynasty was one of the most influential in Europe, but became renowned for inbreeding, which was its eventual downfall. We show for the first time that there is a clear positive relationship between inbreeding and appearance of the Habsburg jaw. The researchers recruited ten specialist facial surgeons to identy the Habsburg jaw in  portraits of  members of the dynasty. Despite dferences in artistic style, the portraits are characterised by a realistic approach to the human face. The surgeons were asked to diagnose eleven features of the Habsburg Jaw - or mandibular prognathism - as well as seven features of maxillary deficiency, the most recognisable of which are a prominent lower lip and an overhanging nasal tip. The portraits are hanging in some of the most prominent art museums in the world, including the KunsthistorischesMuseum in Vienna and the Prado in Madrid. The surgeons gave scores for the degree of mandibular prognathism and maxillary deficiency in each member of the Habsburg family. Mary of Burgundy, who married into the family in , showed the least degree of both traits. The Habsburg jaw was most pronounced in Philip IV, King of Spain and Portugal from  to . Maxillary deficiency was diagnosed to the greatest degree in five members of the family: Maximilian I , his daughter Margaret of Austria, his nephew Charles I of Spain, Charlesapos great-grandson Philip IV and the last in the Habsburg line, Charles II. Detecting a correlation between the two conditions, the researchers speculated that they share a genetic basis. The extent of inbreeding was calculated from a large-scale family tree, including more than , iniduals belonging to more than  generations. The researchers detected a strong relationship between the degree of inbreeding and the extent of the Habsburg jaw. The relationship to maxillary deficiency was also positive, but it was only statistically signicant in two of the seven features diagnosed.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA top chef who has made meals for the Queen has shared his secret to cooking bacon to perfection. Jeff Baker, who has more than three decades experience in a professional kitchen, says a lot of people do it wrong and often the fry-up favourite ends up being too greasy. Instead, the tasty treat should be nice and crisp and there is a simple way to achieve this, according to Jeff. The award-winning Michelin-starred cook, who has worked with some of the best in the business, has lted the lid on how to cook bacon the right way. And it involves getting the pan nice and hot, rather than cooking the meat slow and steady. This should create caramelisation – which makes the rashers crispy and creates a punchier flavour. He told the Daily Star: I find that the best way to cook bacon is on a medium to high heat pan with a small amount of natural fat, searing it on each side for a minute or so. “If the bacon is properly dry cured and cut to a nice thickness, it should caramelise on the edges. “The fat will then render without dissolving, resulting in delicious flavour.” Controversially, Jeff, who is executive development chef for Online butchery retailer Farmison  Co, doesn’t think you should be adding any condiments to your bacon either. He added: “In my opinion,cooked this way the bacon won’t need any sauce to enhance the taste - it’ll be perfect as it is.  Meanwhile, Jeff has also revealed we make a big mistake when cooking curry too. He believes that to make the most of our spices, we should instead apostemperapos them in a pan. This involves heating them in hot oil to intensy the flavours before adding them to the meal. To ‘temper’ your spices means to heat them up in oil to bring out their flavours, he explained.

We are London and we wonapost fall.apos Khan, , from Stoke, was on licence and wearing an electronic monitoring tag when he launched the attack, which injured three others, after he was invited to the prisoner rehabilitation conference on Friday afternoon. The event was organised held by Learning Together, a programme associated with Cambridge Universityaposs Institute of Criminology. The attack has prompted the Ministry of Justice to review the licence conditions of every convicted terrorist released from prison, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson said was probably about  people.Mr Johnson has vowed to take steps to ensure people are not released early when they commit serious offences. But the family of Mr Merritt, from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, asked for his death to not to be used to justy introducing even more draconian sentences on offenders in a heartfelt tribute released on Sunday.  They said: He lit up our lives and the lives of his many friends and colleagues, and we will miss him terribly. Jack lived his principles he believed in redemption and rehabilitation, not revenge, and he always took the side of the underdog. We know Jack would not want this terrible, isolated incident to be used as a pretext by the government for introducing even more draconian sentences on prisoners, or for detaining people in prison for longer than necessary. And in a tweet on Sunday evening, Mr Merrittaposs father David said: Donapost use my sonaposs death, and his and his colleagueaposs photos - to promote your vile propaganda. Jack stood against everything you stand for - hatred, ision, ignorance. Miss Jones, a volunteer with Learning Together from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, was described as having a great passion for providing support to victims of crime by her family. In a statement, they said: She was intent on living le to the full and had a wonderful thirst for knowledge, enabling her to be the best she could be. Saskia had a great passion for providing invaluable support to victims of criminal injustice, which led her to the point of recently applying for the police graduate recruitment programme, wishing to specialise in victim support.  Khan, who was living in Stafford, was given permission to travel into the heart of London by police and the Probation Service. Convicted of terror offences in February , he was released from prison on licence in December , halfway through his -year prison sentence. He launched the fatal attack at the Learning Together event just before pm on Friday.

Little Courtney had been forced to understand the meaning of money – and how it feels to live without it. Hungry and cold, instead of enjoying a carefree childhood she worried about how her family would survive. She says: “Sometimes we slept in our coats because we couldn’t afford the heating. Mum sometimes didn’t have any dinner so me and my brother could eat ours. Or we would go to the foodbank to get food. “It was scary sometimes because I was worrying about money. It would worry me at school, and I wanted to make it better for my mum.” Mum Charlotte had fled abuse and was housed in a three-bedroom flat in Cambridge – one of the most expensive cities in the UK – with Courtney and her brother Nathaniel James, six. Out of work after being diagnosed with a serious mental health condition, the mum-of-two faced a five-week wait for Universal Credit and says she had to live on just £-a-day child benefit. Are you a struggling parent  Email webnews@mirror To add insult to injury, she had to find the money to pay bedroom tax – meaning there was little left to feed her young children or keep them warm. Charlotte, , says: “I felt like I was living in third world country, I had so little money. I had to make tough choices between paying to heat the flat, or buying food for the kids. “I’d get down to my last few pence and have nowhere to turn. Sometimes I’d go without food to make sure the kids ate – they always came first. “A lot of people are just one crisis away from living below the breadline. “We were OK before I had to move. The flat in Cambridge had three bedrooms, and I was told my children should be sharing a room, so had to pay an extra £ in bedroom tax. I had to take a loan out to pay for food for Christmas and to pay my rent and bills. I got behind on rent while waiting for my first Universal Credit payment. We had nothing. It was hell.”  That first time at the foodbank, hungry and confused, little Courtney didn’t even know what the place was. She says: “I thought a foodbank is where food came out of a bank – like a hole in the wall where money comes out, but with food in it. It was really weird being there – I didn’t like it. I can’t always get what I want to eat, because Mum doesn’t have that kind of money. But that day I got Pringles and biscuits. I went back there a few times with my mum.” Courtney is one of the . million children growing up in poverty in the UK, where one in three youngsters are living below the breadline. That is are why we are today asking readers to Give Kids a Cracking Christmas as we launch our Christmas appeal for charity Action for Children. Child poverty will surge to a -year highthe Conservatives remain in power, an influential think-tank says. And the country’s biggest foodbank charity, the Trussell Trust, is bracing itself for its busiest December ever, after distributing , emergency food parcels to children last Christmas. Courtney and her family were eventually forced to move to Hull, where Charlotte was able to save more than £-a-month in rent – vital money she needed for food and bills.

Sammy Warnes, , says her nausea was so bad when she was ten weeks pregnant with daughter Arabella, now three, she considered an abortion.Strong medication from her doctor did not work, so she started using cannabis until the symptoms disappeared at  weeks, Wales Online reports.Sammy said her daughter was born fit and healthy, so when she experienced the same nausea with her current pregnancy she began smoking cannabis a few times a week to alleviate the symptoms. Now -weeks pregnant with her second child, she spends £ every three weeks and gets her supply from the internet. The -year-old said she got the idea after she read on an online forum that other mums-to-be used the Class B drug to cure severe morning sickness. Sammy, from Leeds, said: The thing is the prescription drugs do more damage. Thereaposs risk of birth defects so theyaposre quite scary to be fair. One of them was making my body do random movements. That stuff panics me. Itaposs actually saved both me and my babyaposs le. This time round has been ten times worse. Iaposve had to give my job up because I just couldnapost do anything. With just two puffs Iaposm able to be a parent to my daughter. I only do it a few times a week. I can do normal things like go to the shops, take her to nursery and just be a mum. Beforehand I was just being sick or waiting around to be sick. I was just knackered. People will say aposOh she just wants to be a druggieapos but itaposs not that at all. But I donapost get high off it.  Itaposs a couple of puffs with a minimum bit of baccy. There needs to be a conversation about this so other women know thereaposs something out there that can help them. Unless youaposve been through it you donapost really get it. Doctors had prescribed her Domperidone, a drug used to relieve nausea and vomiting, but the claims the symptoms only disappeared for  minutes. She claims she discovered several forums suggesting cannabis as a solution. She said: I decided to do my own bit of research. It was all getting too much. I wanted to seethere were any old-wives tales or aposold fashioned tipsapos that would help me out. Then I found quite a few forums on women using cannabis to stop their morning sickness. I was so desperate I thought Iaposd give it a go. I was a bit nervous when I first did it but I was reassured by all the things I read on the forums.  I think anyone would be at first. It was to medicate my body, not to get stoned. Iaposm not abusing it or trying to get blazed. Some days I have good days and donapost need it. Other days I am throwing my guts up and need a couple of puffs. I got some a few days later and as soon as I took it the symptoms just went away.  It wasnapost just a case of me feeling sick the whole time. I couldnapost do anything at all. It was amazing - it helped me get out of bed in the morning.  It literally worked straight away. I didnapost tell my midwe as to be honest I didnapost want to cause unnecessary stress. NHS guidelines say using cannabis regularly during pregnancy could affect a babyaposs brain development and smoking with tobacco increases the risk of the baby being born small or premature.

Sammy said: I was put on the tables again but the same thing happened. The sickness would disappear for about  minutes but then Iaposll be back to hugging the toilet all day. Iaposve had no choice but to take it. It worked so well last time. This time the sickness was ten times worse and I was considering having a termination.  Despite the taboo surrounding smoking cannabis, Sammy said she has both the support of her friends and family. She said: I smoke it in my back garden in the mornings. My family are very anti-drugs and when I told them they initially kicked off. But when I told them the full story, they were like apos it works for you thataposs fineapos.

Speaking to the Sunday Express, he said serious questions” needed to be asked about the prince’s “fabulous income”. “I think [the lease] should be looked at and it should be put at market rate – £ a week for that type of place is very small beer. “I hope that in the next Parliament, whoever the members of the new Public Accounts Committee are, they will look at that forthwith. “Serious questions have to be asked about where Prince Andrew’s wealth comes from.Mr Evans, who is standing for reelection as the Labour MP for Islwyn in South Wales, added: the books need to be opened and the prince needs to start telling people where this fabulous income is coming from. Andrew’s -acre estate in Windsor Great Park is the former home of the Queen Mother and includes several other cottages.  According to a  National Audit Office report, the lease was not offered up to the wider market because of its “sensitive location”.

Critics last night demanded a ­Parliamentary inquiry into claims the Duke of York “plugged a private bank for the super-rich” owned by millionaire financier David “Spotty” Rowland. Mr Rowland, who was a tax exile for decades, once helped clear Sarah ­Ferguson’s debts. It is claimed a whistleblower was so concerned about Andrew’s business dealings they emailed Prince Charles in August to warn him about them. It comes after the duke was forced to step back from frontline duties amid the fallout from his disastrous Newsnight interview about his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Labour’s ex-Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant called for an inquiry into the claims to be carried out by either the Foreign Affairs Committee or the Public Accounts Committee. Speaking to the Mirror, he said: “It should look at the evident conflict of interest when he was travelling at great expense to the taxpayer as a trade envoy but actively pursuing his own financial interests and those of his mates.” It is claimed that during official trade missions on behalf of her Majesty, Andrew, , allegedly promoted his pal’s Luxembourg-based operation as he gained access to the super-rich elite. The prince reportedly let Rowland and his family schedule meetings during official trade tours, so they could court powerful and wealthy clients. In response, Buckingham Palace insisted the duke was promoting British interests “not the interests of iniduals”. Andrew has also been accused of giving the Rowlands sensitive government documents they had no right to see. Leaked emails reveal he demanded a private briefing about the then Labour Government’s attempt to reclaim £.billion owed by Iceland after the collapse of online bank Icesave. Papers drawn up by one of then Chancellor Alistair Darling’s top aides are claimed to have been sent to Mr Rowland by Andrew two hours later with a suggestion he wait before making his “move”.  Only months earlier, the Rowlands had bought a ision of a collapsed Icelandic bank in an £million deal. Andrew also took Spotty’s son, ­ Jonathan, on an official trade mission to Saudi Arabia. There they met Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud, second son of the country’s current monarch. The duke also had a % stake in a firm in the British Virgin Islands called Inverness Asset Management that existed until March. It is claimed it was used to attract wealthy connections to invest in a tax-free offshore fund. According to the Mail on Sunday, one email shows when Andrew faced the sack from his trade envoy role due to his friendship with Epstein, Jonathan Rowland suggested their commercial activities continue “under the radar”.Andrew replied: “Ilike your thinking”, the paper alleges.Further exchanges with Andrew’s office are said to detail attempts to promote the Rowlands’ business on the duke’s visits to the Middle East and China. On one trip, Andrew reportedly lobbied the King of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al Khala, about the Rowlands’ plans to open an offshoot of their bank in the country.  He later telephoned an official to help get the lucrative venture off the ground, it is alleged. In  Andrew opened Mr Rowland’s bank in Luxembourg in his official capacity. Two years later it was revealed the property tycoon, , had helped pay off some of the Duchess of York’s debts. He is reported to have handed Fergie £,. Epstein separately loaned her £, to pay creditors. In  Mr Rowland caused Prime Minister David Cameron embarrassment when he quit as Tory party treasurer before taking up his post. His appointment to the role had been dogged by criticism over his former status as a tax exile. After he gave £million to the party in , it emerged he had lived in Guernsey for tax purposes but ed to full UK residency to be able to donate to the party legally. Leaked emails from Jonathan Rowland also allege Andrew planned to take a stake in the family’s bank.

Rebecca Fry claims she was simultaneously electrocuted, set on fire and shot  feet into the air during a balloon ride after it collided with power cables  feet above the ground. The then -year-old had posed for a selfie moments before the idyllic ride in May  - which was a gt from her fiancee Bret Hay - became a fiery catastrophe. She suffered agonising burns and was airlted to hospital for emergency treatment after the balloon crash-landed in a field in Earls Barton, Northamptonshire. Ms Fry, now , of Northampton, needed four weeks of intensive treatment in a specialist burns unit and required skin grafts to repair her damaged body. As she expects the birth of her first child Ms Fry is suing flight operators The Sackville Balloon Flying Group for more than £million in damages. Reliving the the terror of the mid-air crash, Ms Fry said: The basket burst into flames and the intense heat forced the balloon to shoot up - the heat was making it rise.  I was trying to scream, but I couldnapost open my mouth as the electricity was pressing my teeth together. My leggings were burnt and melted into my body. I thought I was going to die. My body became numb and I thought aposIaposm on fireapos. I could feel electricity going through me and I couldnapost see or hear anything.  I had no control over my body. I was conscious throughout most of it, I felt asmy neck was going to snap. During a pre-trial hearing in Londonaposs High Court Romilly Cummerson, her barrister, spoke about the impact the incident had had on Ms Fry. She is still having dficulties, particularly in respect of her psychiatric injuries, the lawyer said.  The accident occurred at a particularly inopportune moment for her, as she was about to embark on a course that she was hoping would lead to a medical degree. Ms Fry has tried to get back into a health care role as a nurse, but has experienced quite signicant dficulties. Ms Fry claims the accident stalled her hopes of studying to become a doctor, and part of her claim is for loss of future earnings as a medic.  Her claim includes damages for psychiatric trauma and for the impact of the balloon crash on her potential medical career. While they admit liability for her injuries, defence lawyers are disputing the amount of compensation she deserves.

I think he got around  in his short time here.“His attitude was phenomenal. He was no big-time Charlie – a nicer guy you couldn’t meet.“Everyone at the club loved big Louis. He would come over from Fe on the bus two nights a week for training. Nothing was a problem for him. He would pick up the cones or lend a hand with the kit.“On a match day, any instructions our manager Jamie McCunnie gave him, he carried them out to a T.”Finlayson reckons Appere’s future in the game may not stop at Tannadice.“His attitude means football should hold no barriers for him. He’ll give everything he’s got.“He used us as a . It was a chance to get playing men’s football. He said he would give it his best shot.“It was a fantastic opportunity and he took it with both hands. He came to us as a boy and left the club as a man.”Although dferent types of players, Finlayson says there are similarities between Appere and Murray, a player he worked with at another local junior club, Violet.Finlayson continued: “John McGlashan brought Simon to Violet.“He was a great lad, a bit older, a bit mischievous and a bit more street-wise than Louis.“But when that whistle went he was totally focused. In that respect he was very similar to Louis.“When he came to the club we were struggling against relegation but his goals and performances lted us up the table.“He was working as a plumber at the time but his performances saw him move to Tayport, then quickly on to Arbroath and Dundee United.“He’s since played for Hibs and Dundee and now he’s down in South Africa turning out for Bidvest Wits.“He’s done very well for himself.”Finlayson admits junior football isn’t for everyone but he reckons it can be either the path into senior football or a learning curve for young pros.He went on: “Players must have the right attitude to play junior football.“There can sometimes be a wee bit of senior snobbery. Not every club will send players out to the juniors.“But the likes of Peterhead boss Jim McInally is always in touch to see what’s going on and who the better players are.“Playing in the juniors can sometimes tell you a lot more about a young lad than, say, turning out in games in the U  league for their senior teams.“I’m convinced many would benefit more from a season in junior football.“However, they must have the right mentality – Louis and Simon certainly had that.“Junior football should not be discredited – it’s character- building.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/BeFunky-collage-3-3-140x82.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"calum butcher signs new deal at dundee united until 2023","story":"Calum Butcher has signed a new deal at Dundee United until .The combative midfielder has extended his stay at Tannadice after an impressive  months since re-joining the club last January.United currently sit top of the Championship and Butcher was delighted to get his future with the Tangerines sorted out.#I am delighted to sign the contract,” he said.“United is a great place to be right now.

I have watched it back a couple of times now and there was nothing in the game.“You get a lot of games like that in this league. You get chances like the one for Kane Hemmings that was blocked and,that goes in, then you think we are coming out in the second half and having a right go.“It’s all s and buts.

We’re five games unbeaten and are feeling good about ourselves.“We go into the game tomorrow full of confidence and three points again would keep that run going.“We’ve got a nice little gap at the top of the league so we’ll try to push on and create an even bigger gap.”Former Aberdeen and MK Dons winger Pawlett hobbled off after just three minutes against Partick but believes he is now ready to play his part tomorrowboss Robbie Neilson calls on him.“I feel good,” he added. “I’ve had my first full week back in training, so I’m definitely getting back up to speed and looking forward to the match tomorrow.“It was a hamstring and I knew straight away that I’d done something. The best thing for me at the time was to come off and get it right.“It’s taken me a few weeks but I feel all right, touch wood.“It was a strain-type thing in the low point of my hamstring.“I’ve had it before and I know what it takes to get back so, hopefully, that’s me ready to go now.”Injuries and competition for places has seen Pawlett’s game time limited this term but he is happy to play his part where he can and has confidence in the whole squad.“It’s a team game, everyone plays their part during the season. Everyone will have their own stints in the team where they’ll do well.“The main aim is to be up in the Premiership and, as long as whoever is on the pitch is doing the business, that’s the important thing.“The boys have been playing really well. They’re full of confidence and, with me joining back in with training this week, you can see that.“They’re all looking sharp and strong, ready to go again.”The last time the two teams met in September, United ran out - winners. However, Pawlett is expecting a sterner test this time.“That game we started very well and kept the momentum right through the  minutes so it would be nice to have that again.“It will be a tough ask, they’re a good side Morton, so we’ll have to be at our best.“Not every game can be a fancy - or - victory, sometimes at these tough places you need to grind out - wins. Title-winning teams do that. If we get both parts of our game right, hopefully, we can pick up the three points.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street toils for dundee as united look to stretch their lead","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Graeme Finnan dissect where Dundee go after their recent defeat to Inverness, ask will United keep up their winning run at Morton and can Scotland make Euro  Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or Scotland.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

Side effects are very rare and the risk is lower than surgery.“The introduction of the on-site lithotripsy service has tripled our capacity to treat patients with stone disease with one of the least invasive techniques available.“Previously, we were limited to endoscopic procedures which were performed with general anaesthetic or we relied on the visiting service which was only available every six weeks and was not as patient-centred as the new on-site lithotripsy service.“As the new service is on-site, it enables us to offer emergency treatment to patients during the same admission or the latest within two weeks. This had a signicant impact on emergency theatre utilisation and on readmission rates due to pain and allows patients tofaster to their normal lives.”Dr Mokadem praised the positive impact the addition was having on patients.He said: “The new service signicantly reduces waiting times for other urological procedures too. As more and more patients are treated in the lithotripsy suite, this has freed more theatre time and capacity to treat other urological conditions.”Prior to the launch of the service at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary clinicians relied on a touring service.Dr Mokadem said: “Patients received treatment then it could be three months before the next session.”Sheena Lonchay, manager of the NHS Grampian Endowment Fund, said she was “delighted the charity has been able to support the project”.She added: “The Endowment Fund exists to benefit patients in ways that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible and that is exactly what this system does.”Endowment committee chairwoman Luan Grugeon added: “I think we all know someone who has suffered the pain of kidney stones and this new service will allow patients to be treated more quickly.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.48741791-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.48741791-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.48741791-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.48741791-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen edge past st mirren 2 1 after late joe lewis penalty save","story":"Aberdeen saw off struggling St Mirren - at Pittodrie but needed a superb double save from Joe Lewis at a late penalty to get all three points.The Dons went ahead through prolic striker Sam Cosgrove who netted his th of the season before Jonathan Obika equalised.Niall McGinn put the Reds - up but Buddies were awarded a penalty with just minutes remaining when Lewis fouled Obika.However, Dons keeper Lewis brilliantly saved Tony Andreu#s spot-kick before recovering quickly to also block Andreu#s second shot after pouncing on the rebound.Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes made three changes to the side that dropped points to St Johnstone, the Premiership’s bottom side.Returning to the starting line-up were Zak Vyner, back from a shoulder injury, Dean Campbell and Jon Gallagher.Dropping to the bench were Mikey Devlin, Shay Logan and Curtis Main.Long-serving defender Andy Considine was given a guard of honour by both Aberdeen team-mates and St Mirren in recognition of making his th Dons appearance in the recent - draw at St Johnstone.Aberdeen set up with three at the back and that was nearly exploited inside the opening minute  when a  chipped through ball from Sam Foley picked out Andreu.He chested the ball to take it beyond the back-tracking Jon Gallagher before unleashing a a vicious -yard drive that keeper Joe Lewis blocked.Aberdeen went ahead through goal machine COSGROVE in the sixth minute.The Dons came close in the th minute when Ryan Hedges flighted over a superb cross to the back post that Greg Leigh headed down into Cosgrove#s path.The prolic scorer pulled a shot wide from the edge of the penalty area.The Dons should have netted in the nd minute when Lewis Ferguson met a superb Gallagher cross at the back post.He was completely unmarked but the midfielder#s ing header from eight yards hit the ground and bounced just over the bar.It was a costly miss as St Mirren scored within a minute following great play down the right hand side.Ryan Flynn burst towards the byline then cut the ball back and OBIKA stroked it home.In the final minute of a flat, passive and uninspiring half for the Dons McGinn fired in a shot from  yards that was deflected wide for a corner.Early in the second half Hedges shot from the centre of the penalty area but his effort flashed wide.Aberdeen regained the lead in the th minute when Hedges powered down the left hand side and cut back a cross to McGINN.The Northern Ireland cap took a touch then rled home a clinical -yard finish.Moments later a header from Obika dropped just inches wide of the far post.St Mirren were awarded a penalty in the th minute when a long ball over the top caught the defence flat to find Obika.He took a touch to take him towards goal but was taken down by keeper Lewis for a penalty. Greg Leigh perhaps spared Lewis being red carded as he was there to potentially make the challenge.Lewis redeemed himself with a brilliant double save,First he blocked Andreu#s initial spot kick which was drilled low with his right foot.Andreu pounced on the rebound to shoot again but Lewis blocked that as well to secure the three points.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Vyner, Considine, McKenna, Leigh, Ferguson, Campbell, Gallagher, McGinn, Hedges, Cosgrove.Subs: Logan , McLennan , Main Subs not used: Cerny, Devlin, Anderson.ST MIRREN: Hladky, P.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"harry potter halloween at pony club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHarry Potter was the theme for this year’s Hallowe’en Fun Day organised by Argyll South Pony Club at the Long Walk arena near Kilmartin.Even the judges # Ulla Riddell and Mary Lou Aitchison – got into the spirit of the day by dressing as Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

Itrsquos like saying Irsquove not made you homeless by removing your house, you can still stand here. Thatrsquos the frustration.ldquoCouncillor Aitchison said in his response to you that I was commenting from the comfort of opposition. Therersquos nothing at all comfortable about being in opposition. This was not a good decision.\"There hasnrsquot been a consultation and itrsquos very frustrating that the administration just keep going and they get put in the position of defending a decision to close playparks by saying theyrsquore not closing the play parks, they are removing the play equipment. This is madness.Following the announcement of the poundmillion investment in destination playparks earlier this year, members were told that  smaller playparks would be scrapped in Tweeddale.But SNP councillors Heather Anderson and Stuart Bell challenged the decision and insisted it go out to consultation.Councillor Anderson continued: ldquoThere was not an allowance for the maintenance of these new play parks so it was delegated to officers to make sure it was a cost neutral programme and they were to come back with recommendations after consultation.\"Now no consultation occurred, there was no report on the consultation because there hadnrsquot been any. And there was going to be a reference group, but they never met.Two petitions with  signatures against the playpark closures have been received by the audit and scrutiny committee of Scottish Borders Council.Councillor Anderson added: ldquoThese petitions were from people in Hawick and Kelso who were frankly furious at the suggestion of closing playparks in their areas.\"The main argument they made that the recommended playparks for closure were quite close to houses and suitable for younger children, so that whole thing of allowing smaller children to play independently, they would be discriminated against.ldquoThere was a lot of questioning of officers and it became clear that we hadnrsquot been given any information about the costs of maintaining the parks that had been recommended for closure.\"We hadnrsquot been given any information about how much it would cost to maintain the grass after they decommissioned the park. And, we hadnrsquot been given alternatives about some of the parks being upgraded whilst others were closed.ldquoWhere we are now, the decision is in abeyance. Hopefully when we get back after the election we will be able to say can we actually have a genuine consultation about these playparks with some real numbers about what it would cost.\"The future of the small playparks is to come before a full meeting of Scottish Borders Council for consideration.Chairman Les Turnbull said: ldquoIrsquom glad to hear what yoursquore saying about it being in

Itrsquos also a contact point for the council.ldquoThere is also a worry that people arenrsquot going to pop into nearby shops and to use them, itrsquos taking something away from the town centre.ldquoThere is also a big worry in Jedburgh about buildings going out of use. It is situated in a historic building that was purposefully built for the people of Jedburgh as a centre for information.Currently, the council is planning to close the old library, which was first opened in May , when the new intergenerational campus at Hatrigge Park opens in April .The library was built by the Scottish-American steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, who attended the opening ceremony in the town, after an earlier library he had built six years earlier on the high street had proved to be inadequate.Six years ago, Scottish Borders Council voted to integrate its contact centres into the regionrsquos libraries, and since then the council has maintained an outpost in Jedburgh Library, which will also move to the Jedburgh Grammar Campus in April.At the audit and scrutiny meeting, the service director for customers and communities, Jenni Craig, explained that the library will have much longer opening hours at the new campus: ldquoIn relation to accessibility, and the times that the library is open, one of the benefits of moving to the new campus will be the library will be longer.ldquoWe accept that this is a huge change but we also see this as an opportunity.ldquoMembers will be aware that as part of the councilrsquos lsquofit for rsquo transformation programme we are considering how we can deliver services dferently to make the best use of our facilities.ldquoWe have a very challenging financial outlook and we have a five year placen for transforming our services.ldquoIn Jedburgh, the signicant investment in the campus gives us the opportunity to make the most of the facility.After hearing from both sides, councillor Heather Anderson, who represents Tweeddale West, proposed that the matter is formally referred to Ms Craig, and that the service director begins a consultation with the public to address their concerns, from January to March, before the new campus opens in April.The motion was seconded by Galashiels councillor Harry Scott, and the motion was passed, with only Jedburgh councillor Sandy Scott voting against.Speaking after the meeting, petitioner Georgiana Craster said: ldquoIrsquom happy. I was expecting a year long consultation, but you know you ask for bigger and you get lesser, so this is something that we can actually put to the residents.ldquoThere is a lot of sentimentality around the building, and we have to be practical. The school is a wonderful thing, no one is going to say anything against that, but we have to think about everybody, itrsquos not only about educating children itrsquos also about the future of

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

Itrsquos getting busy these days, often with families, which is great to see. Even still there is enough space amidst the trees to quickly find solitudeyou need it.I can never visit this wonderful place without whispering a word of thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson for his role, along with others, in saving this precious and magical wood, which my family has almost literally grown up in.I have got to know Gregor, who still lives in East Lothian, and the world is made a better place by caring and thoughtful people like him.We arrived at the wood in late afternoon, knowing that we wouldnrsquot have a lot of time before nightfall. The ground was literally carpeted with orange and yellow, and autumn colours still hung on the trees.But there was a nip in the air a cold crisp reminder that summer is now long gone and the fingers of winter are about to grip us. So we kept on the move to keep warm.As we ventured deeper into the wood I noticed something. ldquoStop, I said to the kids, ldquoand listen.There was not a breath of wind, it was deathly still. The trees stood in absolute silence. I couldnrsquot even hear any traffic, or the usual distant murmurings of modern day le. There was no noise, only the sound of nature.Bird song was above us. I was surprised to hear such a chorus on a late autumn afternoon.We stood, listening. It was asthe birds were suddenly singing for us, and the children were genuinely enthralled, as was I.We decided to continue our walk, but our mood had now changed. The silence could have been eerie but it wasnrsquot, it heightened our awareness that the wood had le we couldnrsquot see.It was asour inner senses had been aroused. The kids wanted to walk silently, so they could continue to listen. So we practised ldquowalking like a Native American hunter as taught to us by Chris Yule, another East Lothian environmental luminary.We crept through the wood, looking for deer, and faeries, now acutely aware of any faint sound that the absence of noise made possible to hear.Finally we reached our favourite place, and sat, still listening. I have to tell you, seeing my two youngest being so quiet for so long was a unique experience.Then it began to get dark, and the bird song faded away.We headed back to the car as the trees turned into shadows. But we still stopped every now and then to listen and peer into the undergrowth. We were convinced at one point we could see a deer hiding from us.We got to the car as the last glimmering light in the sky vanished, and the moon came out from behind the clouds. It was a magical experience, not a scary one. Wersquod had an unexpected connection with nature, that wasnrsquot visual, but something deeper.I turned the engine on, breaking the silence, and we ed to our world of articial light and constant noise. But the whole walk had had a meditative effect on us, and I reflected on the fact that we are replacing sound with noise, and we are the poorer for that.We are so constantly surrounded by human made sounds that we donrsquot notice it. The noise has become the background to our lives. Few of us probably reflect that we need to connect to the sounds of nature anymore, or true silence itself.Our inner selves do however. Call it what you will, our soul, our spiritual self, our primeval awareness. The truth is we need the absence of noise every now and then so the sounds of nature can be heard. It replenishes us, reminds us who we really are, and lts our mental health. No matter how much we pave nature over with cement, we cannot avoid the fact we are part of it and need it.Yet, we are increasingly separated from it, including the sounds and the silence that comes with the absence of our noise. Is there a connection between this and the mental health crisis we now face The neon lights of a shopping centre, and the constant buzz and noise we fill our everyday lives with may seem like progress, but it isnrsquot for our well being. We need places where such noise is absent ndash where only nature is heard. No, actually, we need many more of these places, but sadly we are going in the reverse direction destroying the ones that survive."},{"url":null,"title":"cockenzie-family-return-italian-roots-open-food-lovers-paradise","story":"They have restored the home of their ancestors in Picinisco in Lazio, Italy, and turned it into a holiday destination complete with a boutique hotel, cookery school and winery.Members of the Di Ciacca family moved to Cockenzie  years ago and Cesido Di Ciacca took over The Cockenzie Cafe, a cafe, fish  chip shop and ice-cream shop, in .The family lived above the shop on  High Street and integrated themselves into the community.

The workshop is such a lovely way to keep Meghanrsquos memory alive.Each Fostering Compassion workshop includes the donation of lsquogts of compassionrsquo from the children to animals in need.Through the Animal Heroes workshops, funds will be raised to donate Smokey Paws oxygen mask kits, used by firefighters to resuscitate animals pulled from fires, to each of the  fire stations in the Lothians, Borders and Fe, which do not yet have them.These gts help encourage compassion and empathy in the children and at the same time, with the blessing of her family, will help keep Meghanrsquos memory alive.Miss Winton added: ldquoMeghan was also a firm believer of lsquorandom acts of kindnessrsquo and created the lsquoWishing Treersquo in Pressmennan Woods in East Lothian where she hung inspirational messages full of hope and love.

After her devastating accident, I was determined the workshop would come to fruition, but would be done as a tribute to her.ldquoWe are greatly honoured to have her familyrsquos blessing to do this and thank them very much for their unwavering support.Fostering Compassion runs animal and nature-themed workshops for children in foster care and kinship care.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him.

You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate.

His living room contains his three Baftas and some lovely oil paintings, and his leather sofa is as inviting as the man himself.But for the past  years chats have taken place upstairs, in another living room. Baxter is now confined to the lower floor even the power of the StairMaster is not strong enough to deal with the complications of having him hoisted in and out.Whatrsquos wrong with him  In a sense, nothing specic his back and hips wonrsquot propel him along the way he moved when recording Busby Berkeley-like dance numbers, as featured in his LWT spectaculars, while playing James Cagney or Ethel Merman.A few years back he had a stent fitted. Baxter had blacked out while on holiday at his villa in Cyprus and awoke to find ldquoa Hattie Jacques-lookalike nurse with a huge bosom standing over me. I thought Irsquod died and woken up in a Carry On film hospital.Hersquos also had two knee replacements and his spine is more worn than his all-time favourite biography .But, in reality, his aches and pains havenrsquot really prevented him from leaving his house for the past two years. What has most likely happened is that Stanley Livingstone Baxter stopped going out when he felt he could no longer play the part of the cheery, vibrant ex-TV star. Baxter once loved his strolls around Highgate Village and the comments from the fans and little old ladies who would delight in his chats, during which he would slip into characters such as Joyce Grenfell and Margaret Rutherford, sometimes without realising he had done so.Andyou stop going out, exercising, your body begins to forget it once danced. Yet, while the short memory is a little looser these days, hersquos still very funny, still sharp. I tell him I interviewed Lulu recently. And she was asking after you, Stanley. ldquoWhat  Lulu  he says, a little surprised, then has a flashback moment. ldquoYes, we almost appeared in panto.:Showbusiness great Stanley Baxter on recording a new show for BBCYes, until you changed your mind at the last minute, Stanley. But she still thinks yoursquore great. Have a look at the video message she made for you. And he listens and grins as Lulu gushes about how much she loves the comedy star. ldquoShersquos very Scottish now, he says, grinning. ldquoDoes she always speak like that  Perhaps shersquos cranked up the Dennistoun accent just for you. ldquoThat was very kind of her, he deadpans.He adds, in more serious voice. ldquoI havenrsquot seen her since she lived along the road but I canrsquot remember when that was.While Stanley Baxter is a little forgetful these days, Scotland has become a little forgetful of the magnitude of the manrsquos talent, the performer of whom Billy Connolly said, \"Stanley Baxter is a genius. I came to London because of Stanley Baxter.\"Baxter, as the new programme reveals, came to London in , realising the writing was on the wall for iety theatre in Scotland. In any case, he had guessed the potential of television. ldquoI knew I could pull the faces and do the voices, and I sensed the closeness of TV would work for me.Within months of arriving in North London, Baxter, who grew up in Glasgowrsquos West End, just a few hundred yards from BBC Scotland, was appearing in comedy review series On The Bright Side, alongside bright young things such as Una Stubbs and Ronnie Barker.Baxter never looked back. Years later hersquodto Scotland to star in panto in Glasgow and Edinburgh, but television and films such as Very Important Person, alongside the likes of James Robertson Justice and Julie Christie made him a celebrity across Britain.However, the Channel  show takes audiences way back into Baxterrsquos early le. It takes us into the flat he grew up in and talks of his motherrsquos determination to hothouse a little star. Little Stanley didnrsquot disappoint. ldquoI think he is someone who pirouetted out of the womb, says actor-fan Miriam Margolyes.Baxter had fallen in love with cinema almost out of necessity. At Hillhead School he didnrsquot find too much in common with his classmates. And he wasnrsquot overly caught up with their choice of films either. Flash Gordonrsquos ray gun didnrsquot excite him at all, although he liked the camp outfits. Young Stanley, however, did get excited watching adult melodramas such as Dodsworth and musicals such as Meet Me in St Louis.Those memories at the Grosvenor in Byres Road or the Ascot in Anniesland later re-emerged as brilliant television pastiches which are revealed in this show.The programme also rewinds on Baxterrsquos National Service stint, offering an opportunity to show lots of great film and TV clips of the actor in unorm, playing stf upper-lipped sorts to ordinary soldiers. Yet, the truth is Baxter, who had become a radio star at , never fought anything other than boredom during his National Service. ldquoI enjoyed the marching, he says, smiling. ldquoItrsquos all choreography. But when I was sent to Burma le was so boring I considered shooting himself with my rle.Thankfully, however, Combined Services Entertainments was formed and he joined the troupe of performers who staged shows in the Far East, which proved to be ldquothe most wonderful time. Baxter met up with new friends such as Kenneth Williams, John Schlesinger and Peter Nichols, and the quarter set about entertaining the troops, but mostly themselves.Baxter and Williams became great friends. But while they never fought the Germans ndash the war was long over ndash itrsquos also fair to say they often fought for the same air space. Both loved and needed to be the centre of attention.However, the mood in the room turns dark as Baxter reveals that histo Civvy Street was almost unbearable. ldquoI felt like cutting my wrists, he says, in a slightly melodramatic voice that hints at the depression he felt.But eventually, he found his way into the Citizens Theatre, where within two years he was writing a hit pantomime review show, The Tintock Cup, which ran for six months. Baxter then moved to commercial theatre, starred in iety with the Half-Past Eight Shows at the Alhambra Theatre in Glasgow. Comedian and writer Barry Cryer says one of few Scots he ever wrote for at the time was Stanley Baxter. ldquoStanley easily transferred to England because he wasnrsquot just a Scots comedian. He was a comic actor who could become whoever he chose to be.He chose to become a film star. The Evening Standard reported that \"Stanley Baxter is the new Peter Sellers.\"ldquoWhat fools, says the man himself now with a self-deprecating shrug.Baxter made five films but never became a movie legend. His light comedy films were made to seem silly alongside the gritty kitchen sinkers of the period, such as Billy Liar.He ed to television, however, and made series after series, he made one-off specials, capturing the social mores of the period. And what wersquove forgotten is that the Scot was incredibly risque. ldquoI was a bit cheeky, he says, grinning. Cheeky  Try subversive. Somehow, he managed to slip in sketches that referenced homosexuality, lesbian love affairs and even the odd nod to bestiality.He even managed one outrageous parody of Upstairs Downstairs . \"Remember the night I came to you and told you the old queen had gone \" says Upstairs Downstairsrsquo maid Rose, to Mrs Bridges the cook. \"Yes,\" blusters Mrs Bridges. \"And I told you not to speak so disrespectfully of Mr Hudson.\"He had one LWT sketch in which private eye Philip Marlowe tries to solve the Cinderella mystery of the prince and the glass slipper, which ends with Marlowe and the Prince having a gay affair.And, of course, Baxter never shied away from becoming the Queen, with whom he shared a birth year.But the Channel  programme also shows that Baxter was the master of his own undoing, in terms of the TV he made. ldquoI grew up dreaming of Hollywood and fantastic productions. And so when I began to do pastiches I wanted them to be so perfect I had to create every idea. And they cost a fortune. And so TV companies kept sacking me.The tribute to Stanley Baxter also covers an area of Baxterrsquos le that he hasnrsquot discussed in the past, his seeming reclusiveness. Channel  has uncovered a clip that opens with a shot of the Houses of Parliament and a very posh, pin-stripe-suited gent on the phone. \"Stanley Baxter  No, Irsquom afraid not,\" he says. \"Donrsquot you know hersquos a recluse  Even his agent hasnrsquot seen him for months. Someone thought they saw him in New York wearing a floppy hat and dark glasses, but it turned out to be Greta Garbo.\"Was Stanley Baxter a recluse  Therersquos no doubt he avoided showbiz parties the way he avoided the nit-haired boy next to him in class. His mind was closed to West End theatrersquos opening nights but itrsquos entirely wrong to say he locked the front door from the inside.In recent years, Saturday afternoons saw him at the movies in north London, near his home. Twice a week hersquod drive to central Londonrsquos Pall Mall to swim at the RAC club. Midweek hersquod eat out with a dferent chum in Highgate Village. Baxter wasnrsquot a Katie Price ndash he didnrsquot tell the world about his social plans.But has he been, for the most part, happy  Itrsquos certainly been a battle to put his great concerns aside, his sometimes desperate drive to create great TV, his need to be in control which emerged in the OCD which meant le, in all manners, had to be timetabled to the minute.ldquoIrsquom happy that this show has been made, he smiles, as he pours himself a gin and tonic and chuckles. ldquoBut I canrsquot just sit here and admire myself.Stanley Baxterrsquos Best Bits, Channel Five, tonight at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"alan-roden-tv-confrontations-exposed-lack-honest-answers-politicians","story":"A stony silence.ldquoYou said your party has a zero-tolerance approach to Islamophobia, so what action should be taken against you for using the term lsquoletterboxrsquo to describe Muslim women who wear a burqa More silence.ldquoWill you tell voters the truth about your relationship with businesswoman Jenner Arcuri and why you didnrsquot declare a personal interest when you were London Mayor Yet more silence.If Boris Johnson really does fail to appear for a grilling by Andrew Neil, the BBC should just go ahead with a half-hour prime-time programme where the Prime Minister is empty chaired.Mr Neil could read out the questions he would have asked anyway, making for compelling viewing. But perhaps even that would be a risk that Dominic Cummings and Tory advisers would be willing to take. After all, those who have agreed to an Andrew Neil interview in this election campaign have found it an unforgiving experience.First up was Nicola Sturgeon.The First Minister is an accomplished media performer ndash easily the most competent politician in front of a camera in Scotland, and surely in the top ten across the UK.Her interview wasnrsquot quite the car crash that social media would perhaps suggest, but it was certainly a deeply uncomfortable  minutes.Her wild assertions about how easily an independent Scotland could stroll into the EU were ruthlessly exposed, and she may come to regret describing the SNPrsquos currency tribulations as a lsquojourneyrsquo.The -second-long list of problems facing the NHS under the Nationalists also deserved the million-plus audience it has since received online. Yet at times the First Minister held her own and, realistically, her performance is unlikely to cost the SNP many votes.However, it might help some Labour left-wingers in England understand why their Scottish colleagues get so angry when they describe Ms Sturgeon as a comrade.Predictably, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, fared far worse in his own interview. Thoroughly displeased at being there, he repeatedly struggled to explain how he would pay for his manesto promises.Then, with voters screaming lsquojust apologisersquo at their TV sets, he refused four times to say sorry for the anti-semitism shaming his leadership.If heads were in their hands at Labour HQ, the verdict in Tory HQ will have been lsquowellhellip sod thatrsquo.The Andrew Neil interviews have given voters some food for thought, as these set-piece TV events should.The ITV head-to-head between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn has been the only major let-down so far, with a bizarre format which gave neither politician enough time to answer the questions. On this occasion, the victors were those not invited ndash Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon. With hindsight, perhaps they should have saved their parties from the huge legal bill of trying to get on the line-up.In contrast, the winners in Thursday nightrsquos climate change debate were those who did appear, with Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage reduced to ice sculptures for not showing up.When it comes to how much impact these debates have on the final election result, the jury is out ndash Cleggmania in  didnrsquot really translate to Commons seats.But Electoral Reform Society research has found that  per cent of people believe debates are important, and a third say theyre key to helping them decide how to vote.They want to see points put across clearly, factual evidence for claims, and a debate that engages the audience watching at home. And as well as being watched by millions, they certainly set the campaign narrative.In , Alistair Darling bested Alex Salmond in the first TV debate of the independence campaign. If you canrsquot remember it, Mr Salmond decided to ask questions about alien attacks, while Mr Darling pointed out that an eight-year-old could name their countryrsquos capital, flag and currency, but Mr Salmond couldnrsquot say what currency an independent Scotland would use.In the  election campaign, I was involved behind-the-scenes in the Scottish TV debates. The amount of preparation work was immense. Days of going over attack lines, defence lines, introductory remarks, key messages, second-guessing opponents, and the occasional bit of role-play.Spin doctors had their own role to play on the night as well. The first debate on the BBC involved a nurse telling Ms Sturgeon to her face that NHS staff were having to use foodbanks. While journalists in the spin room tried to file their copy, political advisers interrupted them, talking up their own employer to some extent, but mainly talking down the rest of the line-up.For the SNP, this backfired when the message was spread that the nursersquos husband was a Tory councillor. It categorically wasnrsquot true.However, the Nationalists had a better night of it at the STV debate. Unusually, the broadcaster decided not to provide inidual green rooms for the politicians, so they all had to share the same space for a long time before taking to the stage.Willie Rennie and Ruth Davidson dealt with this through humour, cracking jokes to demonstrate confidence. Kez Dugdale, who I was working for, focused on her notes. Nicola Sturgeon kept herself to herself. She had something up her sleeve.In the debate, she claimed that Kez once told her in a private conversation in the aftermath of Brexit that Labour might rethink its opposition to an independence referendum ndash something she strongly denied. But having run a campaign focused on opposition to independence, this was a lsquogotcharsquo moment. It was, comfortably, the toughest moment of the campaign.So I wish my successors at Scottish Labour, and at all parties, every good fortune for the coming days.This campaign still has nearly a fortnight to run. The Scottish TV debates have yet to be broadcast, there is another Prime Ministerial head-to-head to come, and it remains to be seenBoris Johnson will sit down with Andrew Neil.There are a lot of nervous politicians, and a lot of nervous spin doctors. They have a right to be nervous, because the voters deserve more honest answers."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-marr-show-review","story":"There was Andrew Marr, who was interviewing Boris Johnson on The Andrew Marr Show.

Cue outrage from Labour and others, accusing the corporation of caving in.Come am Sunday, all eyes that were open and focussed were trained on Marrrsquos show.

If that was not the case, why would Downing Street say yes to his request but ldquowersquoll let you know to Neilrsquos  This was as much about Marr v Neil as it was Marr against Johnson.It turned out to be a marvellously tetchy encounter, handbags and harrumphs at dawn stuff, or as near to dawn as we could get without knocking the Match of the Day repeat out of the schedule.Marr began on the London Bridge attack, asking how a dangerous criminal could be released after  years in jail. Labourrsquos fault, claimed Mr Johnson, they brought in a law on automatic early release in . But you have been in power for ten years, Marr replied, you could have changed things. Irsquove been in office  days, said Mr Johnson.So it went on. The two were like characters in a cartoon fight. As verbal fists and feet flew, dust clouds enveloped the pair. Every now and then a speech balloon would pop up. ldquoTen years, kapow! ldquo days, crunch! Thump, thump, thump.Marr changed tack. ldquoYoursquore trying to avoid my questions by carrying on talking, he charged. This was a notable iation on the Mishal Husain line, in which the Today presenter, suffering a similar barrage of bluster from Johnson, told him to ldquoplease stop talking. It did not do her any good, and the same held true for Marr as he proceeded to go down a shopping list of topics from the NHS to library closures, getting nowhere. ldquoYou are chuntering! he told Mr Johnson. ldquoYou keep interrupting me! the PM snapped.The minutes were sprinting away like Bullingdon boys after a spot of bother at a local restaurant. Would Marr ask the big question, the one the media was interested in most of all. To wit: would the PM go on Neilrsquos show  Johnson dodged, weaved, and schmoozed, saying Neil could not have a better agent than Marr , before making his ldquoIrsquoll talk to any BBC Andrew declaration.: Nato Secretary General responds over TridentMarr, running over time, brought the interview to an abrupt end. The cameras focussed on the two men while the credits rolled. Usually in these situations there is a bit of chat, evenit is only the host asking what the guest fancies for breakfast.

Such complex agreements usually take around seven years to complete in draft form as all politicians and media professionals will know.So Brexit will not be \"done\" in any real sense at this election. However what may be done in a very real sense after this election is that the electorate in the UK may be too late to get another chance to change UK policy in order to prevent us reaching a tipping point in the climate change struggle, as most scientist are now telling us.We do not have the luxury of waiting another five years before the UK seriously addresses this issue, and it is clear from both the Tory and Brexit Party that their leaders are not even prepared to turn up for a public debate on this subject which they are refusing to give attention to. In real terms, this may prove to be the climate change election for the UK, rather than the Brexit one and sadly the media are not really facing up to this.The Scottish Government is addressing this issue, and has been for some time, not nearly enough as it will need to do, but to a much greater extent than the UK is doing. In Scotland there have been efforts for some years now to use the limited investment and persuasive powers to influence power production and Scotland has made signicant advances in this area. One simple telling example of this is that the Tories, LibDems and Labour are telling us how many trees they will plantthey are elected. Scotland has planted  million trees in the last year,  per cent of all plantings in the UK, and has the organisation and capacity to develop this further.This question of climate change will prove, in historical terms, to have been the most important issue at this election and the politicians and media who are not seriously addressing this issue, which unfortunately are the majority, are doing a gross disservice to the British people and to democracy.Andy Anderson, Saltcoats.THERE is a small smidgeon of hope for Thelma Edwards wish that our political leaders can find ldquopeace, community and good sense , as Labour, Tory and LibDems promise huge tree-planting programmes in England.

Evenwe had the luxury of a semi-competent and serious UK negotiating team, it is not credible that a multi-year task can be completed in one year. Therefore, the ultra-right-wing hard-Brexiters have baked in their no deal Brexit.The  Scottish Conservative MPs signed up to this manesto and know this very well, but they pretend that they are all for Mr Johnsons deal.

Small countries respond quicker and more successfully to dficult situations.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh EH.OPINION polls merely reflect the mood of the moment. Once their results appear in print, they fix their imprint in the minds of the readers. This can lead iniduals to jump on the bandwagon which the opinion poll points to. Others can be led to believe that there is no longer any point in voting for their chosen preference.Opinion polls operate on the premise of a framework of unalterable algorithms, which cannot take into account the extraordinary circumstances which affect local behaviour or the influence of electoral pacts. This makes opinion polls fallible in extrapolating from their findings to the wider intentions of the nation.This particular General Election has so many factors at work that the mood of the electorate is moving under the radar of what opinion polls are geared to pick up. All that opinion polls can do is to to create an impression that one party or the other is on an irresistible rise, thereby depressing the expectations of those trying to oppose the group portrayed in the poll as likely to winWith almost two weeks left to play, this is going to be a dficult election to call. If there is a serious meltdown by one side or the other, that would hand the election to the party profiting from such a collapse.What we have before us is the poorest collection of political leaders that I have witnessed in my  years as a voter. I am sure that I am not the only one who is finding it dficult to decide which way to vote. It looks as though it is going to be either voting tribally, going with a gut feeling or sticking a pin into the electoral list and so taking a leap into the dark.The two main candidates for the position of Prime Minister do not inspire the electorate that they can be trusted with the future of the countryOpinion polls, then, are rather reminiscent of the theories of the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, who said that everything rolls on and nothing is static.This idea was amplied by stating that you cannot step into the same river twice and refined more humorously with the remark that you cannot step into the same river once. Let that be the caveat to bear in mind when presented with any opinion poll.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.HAVING listened to him on TV recently my candidate for the \"Most boring politician of the Election\" must surely go to Barry the bore, Gardiner, Labours Shadow Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change in the last Parliament.

One of those at risk is Mr Raab, the Brexiter who didnrsquot understand how important Dover is to trade, and the man, too, who said people use foodbanks not because theyrsquore poor but because they have ldquocash-flow problems. The under-currents also make Scottish seats like Mr Blackfordrsquos just as hard to predict.The reason for the unpredictably is a trend in politics that started in earnest in the s but has now reached its apotheosis. In , after a  start in , Labour won the General Election thanks in a large part to tactical voting and itrsquos been a signicant factor in elections ever since. The Tories did well in Scotland in the last General Election, for example, because so many voters chose to vote tactically against the SNP.:SNPrsquos Ian Blackford has a great deal to answer for ndash Lord Menzies CampbellLooking at the polls, this tactical voting trend is going to be even more important this year. According to polling by the Electoral Reform Society,  per cent of voters plan to vote tactically to thwart a candidate they donrsquot like, although itrsquos amazing the figure isnrsquot much higher. Theresa May would have won a majority in just .% of voters had acted dferently, and this time round, the result will come down to a couple of hundred thousand people. If enough of them vote tactically, Boris Johnson wonrsquot get his majority.Over the years, it looks like more and more voters have started to understand this and wersquore now at the point where tactical voting is almost like a political party of its own. It has led to weird sights such as the former Tory minister Michael Heseltine standing behind a LibDem podium and the former Blair PR man Alastair Campbell saying ldquodonrsquot vote Labour! . There are also any number of tactical voting websites that will tell you how to achieve your aim.And it appears to be starting to work. In , Dominic Raab won Esher and Walton with nearly  per cent of the vote andthe national polls were replicated in the seat on December , he would easily win again. However, the current polling in his seat puts the Tories on %, just five per cent ahead of the LibDems. Perhaps Remainers in the constituency who are still wondering whether they should switch should listen to Alastair Campbell: Donrsquot vote Labour!:Harry Dunn: Dominic Raab booed and branded a coward as he leaves hustingsTactical voting is just as important, albeit more complicated, in Scotland, and therersquos evidence that the voters, and the parties, are willing to use it. In recent days ndash much to the amazement and disgust of some ndash support for the Conservatives in Scotland has been rising at the same time itrsquos been falling in England and the explanation has to be that some Unionist voters are choosing the Tories as a tactical vote against the SNP.Therersquos also been evidence of tactical thinking where in Scotland. In Ian Blackfordrsquos seat, for example, therersquos been suspicion that some of the candidates are working to an official pact to maximise voting for the LibDems, and the LibDemsrsquo private polling shows itrsquos having an effect. Some voters may also be unable to resist the chance to take a big SNP scalp in the way they did with Alex Salmond in  .What makes the whole thing much more complicated in Scotland is the way that Brexit and independence intersect. For tactical voting to have any serious effect on the SNP, it requires LibDems and some Labour supporters to switch to the Tories, which many of them did in . But will they be willing to do it again this time, now that the Tories are run by hard Brexiters like Boris Johnson  I suspect a lot of Scottish voters would rather die in a ditch.But the incentive for a big, central group of Scottish voters to behave tactically remains strong. Indeed, the evidence of tactical thinking in Scottish politics underlines a comforting fact about us: there is a still a strong, liberal, progressive, anti-nationalistic centre of voters in Scotland who are just as repulsed by Ian Blackfordrsquos Scottish nationalism as they are by Dominic Raabrsquos British version.If the world was dferent of course, and we were freed of the threats of Brexit and independence , many,not most, of these sensible centrist Scottish voters would support Labour or the LibDems. Certainly, by any realistic, liberal, progressive test, the LibDem manesto wins hands down.However, thatrsquos not the world wersquore stuck with, sadly, which leaves many centrist Scottish voters with an ugly dilemma, especially in seats that will be won either by the Tories or the SNP. Many of the tactical voting guides suggest voting SNP to beat Brexit-supporting Tories, but that misunderstands the subcutaneous trends in modern Scottish politics ndash many Scottish voters do not want Brexit but they do not want independence either. Ideally, they would vote to keep the SNP out of Scottish seats and the Tories out of power at Westminster, but in many constituencies, the system simply does not allow voters to support that option.:SNPs vetting process frustrated by senior MP prior to candidate selectionIn the end, the result of the election will depend on what this group of voters decides to do in Scotland, and what Remainers decide to do in the rest of the UK, but, with Labour support up in England and the Tories up in Scotland, the trend in the polls would seem to suggest that many are already choosing the tactical option. Nicola Sturgeonrsquos pronouncement that a vote for the SNP is a vote for a second Scottish referendum, as well as polls suggesting a Tory majority, may also concentrate the minds of potential tactical voters.And just think of the potential prize on election nightvoters do take the tactical option. .am. Dominic Raab is defeated in Esher and Walton. A little while later, Ian Blackford loses Ross, Skye and Lochaber.

The lsquovast majority,rsquo in fact, claries Graham.And that means officers need digital tools and skills and, increasingly, legal and ethical understanding of how to to use them.Last week Grahamrsquos boss, Chief Constable Iain Livingstone, announced that Police Scotland will early next year roll out what the force call lsquodigital triage devicesrsquo.Early press reports called these lsquocyber kiosksrsquo.What are they really  Laptops that let police officers instantly lsquohackrsquo - not the word the police would use - in to a smartphone at a local station without packing the device off to a lab somewhere for months.The technology could be revolutionary, not least in getting to the bottom of sex crimes.Victims and witnesses already routinely hand over their phones to police, voluntarily. So do suspects, usually under a warrant and sometimes voluntarily because they think their phone data will clear them.The current system can mean waving goodbye to the phone - and everything you need to live and work - for months, as specialist IT investigators crack it open.The triage devices are designed to make a quick assessment about what,any, pertinent evidence, there is in a phone.Graham explains: ldquoThe digital triage devices are effectively a lap top you plug the phone in to. You can use the laptop to see what information is on that phone very quickly.ldquoThe biggest dference is that it is going to allow us to focus on what is important. ldquoBecause at the moment we have to trawl through volumes of data in laborious ways without any kind of practical evidential value.ldquoThe beauty of triage devices is that it very quickly will allow us to capture the evidence pertinent to an investigation and therefore very quickly move us towards taking some action against iniduals.What kind of things could police find  Take threatening behavior. Two thirds of such crimes have a digital footprint. Are there threats or abusive messages on a phone  Or allegations of sexual offenses, a fth of which are categorised as cybercrimes. Are there messages or images or content that is itself criminal. Or are there communications which cast light on alleged crimes that took place in private, the kind of one-on-one offending that can be hard to corroborate  That applies as much to domestic abuse as to sex crimes.And your phone can contain so much more than communications, including your financial data, what you have browsed, your emails, calendars, your whole le. It may even cast light on where you have been thanks to dferent ways of geolocating a device. It can be an alibi. It can help suggest guilt. Or innocence.The sheer volume of private information on a phone explains why it is such a useful detection tool. It also explains why digital triage devices made privacy rights activists were worried.Police Scotland was rapped by MSPs last year for carrying out a pilot scheme with such laptops in Stirling and Edinburgh without fully consulting on how people consented to hand over their phones.Were people really sure they knew what they were getting in to  Were they being helped to understand that their whole world - where they go, where they shop, what they browse, with whom they communicate - was in their phones And, crucially, were they being told that they could change their mind Holyroodrsquos policing sub-committee did not think so.MSPs called a halt un the initial roll-out in April , saying the forcersquos main watchdog, the Scottish Police Authority, had only heard the upsides of digital triage, not potential concerns.The sub-committeersquos convener, Green MSP and ex-police officerJohn Finnie, said: ldquoEven the most fundamental questions, such as the legal basis for using this technology, appear to have been totally overlooked.ldquoThis sub-standard process has resulted in over half a million pounds worth of equipment sitting gathering dust.What followed the criticism was a huge exercise in consultation by Police Scotland, involving a huge number of outside organisations, including those critical of the initial pilot schemes, such as Open Rights.Graham said Police Scotland was ready with a whole package of procedures to ensure nobody is browbeaten in to handing over their entire digital worlds to the police - and that they can change their minds. This includes a leaflet to be taken home by witnesses or victims.Finnie is satisfied. He said: ldquoIt is good that exercise was done, that there was that level of scrutiny and hopefully there will be lessons learned for everybody.Livingstone this week said the final release of the devices would wait until the outcome of another review, by the Information Commissioners Office in to the extraction of information in to phones.In England earlier this year there was controversy earlier this year after police and prosecutors said that victims of sexual crimes would be expected to hand over their phones. That came after a  London rape trial collapsed after belatedly reviewed mobile phone messages undermined the case against the accused.Everybody in policing and outside knows there will be new technical innovations in detection and prevention of crime. Finnie and his subcommittee are already looking at the ethics and legalities or facial recognition.Graham believes that the controversy over cracking in to phones and how to manage informed consent has been lsquohelpfulrsquo for coming issues. Why  Because it got everybody around a table to think about the issues and how to find ways to resolve them.He says: ldquoThe issue here isnrsquot really the digital triage devices, it is probably more that general position society finds itself in that developments in digitisation has brought to the fore a huge number of contested issues about the balance of the requirement of the state to protect its citizens against the privacy people have.Groups advocating for - and supporting - the victims of sex crimes and domestic abuse - were among those taking part in Police Scotlandrsquos consultations. One of the things they were eager to see was a faster resolution of cases thanks to quick extraction of phone data.Graham says: ldquoThe feedback we are getting from victim-centred groups is that you need to make sure people are not losing their phone for a year. They are on a contract, they have bought a phone, itrsquos an expensive device with all the information on it that they need to live their lives.But there is a balance. Graham says: ldquoIn the future we will be looking at developing more tactics and techniques that allow us to access information.ldquoWe can now use [the digital triage device consultation] as a model for how we both reassure and seek advice for people on how we start it tackle some of these really dficult issues.Graham and senior officers are clear on one thing. It is not for them to set the rules on these privacy rights issues.He concludes: ldquoThis is a debate, I think, that is ongoing in society. We need to be a part of that but I donrsquot think the police should be at the centre of making decisions about some of these really challenging issues without wider engagement."},{"url":null,"title":"catalan-flemish-leaders-call-eu-membership-plan","story":"Quim Torra and Jan Jambon want to see \"mechanisms that could allow the integration of new independent states born by democratic means\" in to the union.In a joint statement, the leaders said they believe in a Scottish solution to their aspirations for their nations to split from Spain and Belgium respectively.Mr Torra - whose predecessor lives in exile in Belgium to escape a Spanish arrest warrant - repeated his callsfor \"anagreed referendum like that of Scotland\" in Catalonia.Catalan and Spanish observers have noted that Mr Torra has moved away from Slovene style to Scottish style independence.The Catalan government held an independence referendum in  without the permission of the Spanish authorities.This plebiscite was ruled illegal and its organisers were jailed or forced to flee the country.A Spanish crackdown has seen support for independence fall.

They also took the chance to have a question and answer session and have an Olympic athlete give them some coaching tips. Active Schools Lead Coordinator for Central Aberdeenshire, Malcolm Grant, said: “Across Scotland this month the sporting theme from sportscotland is Local Heroes and Eilish ticked every box during her visits to Oyne Primary and Inverurie Academy. “The focus on personal best resonates strongly across a broad range of school subjects, not just sport, but having Eilish presenting her thoughts on her own career and how she intends to continue to improve and progress, despite her already extensive achievements in athletics, ensured that all of the pupils went home with some extra inspiration and motivation to do the best that they can, whatever they choose to do in the future.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Neil McDonald, Scott Duguid and Peter Taylor at the eBlast celebration event\"  Kintore firm marks th anniversaryviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Lady Michelle Mone OBE attended the Inverurie Loco Works Football Club Business Lunch\"  Inverurie club marks decade of success viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmCOMPETITION: The Orcadian has teamed up with Lidl, to offer readers the chance to win £ worth of vouchers to use in Lidl stores.

The project was allowed to sell meat until October , and this extension takes advantage of the European Commission’s approval for Scotland-wide sales until any new potential EU exit date.These licences permit the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland directly to consumers as well as to retailers, such as hotels and butchers.Claudia Rowse, SNH’s head of natural resource management said #We are delighted to announce the continued sale of resident greylag goose meat. Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We know that striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, allowing them to control goose numbers sustainably and sell goose meat for profit.”SNH have said they are working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland. A project review will take place in January , in light of the UK’s EU exit arrangements, and take into account any changes arising from the current review of its General Licences.Sale of wild goose meat shot outside the project is prohibited under the Wildle and Countryside Act .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The trees that will stand inside and outside the St Magnus Cathedral are from Grimstad and Hordaland, in Norway, respectively.Speaking during an event at the Robert Rendall building in Stromness today Mr Strømmen talked about the visit to Orkney so far — which is a first for him.He said: #There are two things that really stand out when it comes to Orkney — there is the Viking tradition and the fact that Orkney was part of Norway many hundreds of years ago. That legacy, in a way, is still here.#For us, coming to Orkney is a bit like coming home and I hope people will take that in a good sense. In the way society works here, there is something we recognise instantly. I think this is the same for the Icelanders and Swedish.#The Kirkwall Christmas Tree lighting will take place outside St Magnus Cathedral from .pm tomorrow, Saturday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The former Traffic Commissioner for Scotland, who stepped down in February, also never minced her words in  years of regulating buses and lorries.Recalling her time in the hot seat at an event in Edinburgh this week, she said she had turned the “turgid”, paperwork-focused approach of the office into “dynamic engagement” with bus operators and haulage companies, driven by her overarching goal of keeping people safe on the roads.From the cases I have covered over the years, Ms Aitken had no compunction in banning miscreant operators or putting them out of business, and she let them know why in no uncertain terms.She told a Glasgow lorry driver she would not wait until he killed someone, and he could not be trusted behind the wheel because his greed for making more money came before safety.The owner of a South Lanarkshire childcare centre was told that Ms Aitken was “singularly unimpressed by her seeing herself as some sort of victim” - when she had failed to get a licence.Speaking to the Scottish Transport Studies Group think tank, Ms Aitken’s job sounded at times like being a sherf in the Wild West, imposing the law on bus wars, “baddies” and the “criminality” of some operators.However, while Ms Aitken said she had largely stamped out such behaviour, and buses were now much more reliable, punctual and safer, she admitted there was still one key area in which she wished she had done more.The former traffic commissioner said she had noticed sexism soon after taking over, and wondereddodgy operators told her wheels came off buses for no reason “because I was a girl”.She observed there had been some improvements, such as the “nonsense of naked lady photos” on depot walls being removed.But Ms Aitken said there remained “real issues” over increasing the number of women working in transport.A report by the cycling and walking body Sustrans Scotland last year highlighted that transport had the lowest percentage of women in senior posts within the public sector north of the Border - of just . per cent.In addition, despite comprising nearly half the UK workforce, women account for only around one in five transport workers.Ms Aitken observed that while there were some very successful female bus drivers and hauliers, working conditions remained a major deterrent to more women working in the sector.She said part of the problem was the lack of basic facilities, such as toilets, and suitable sht patterns.The Women in Transport group has stressed the importance of a more gender-balanced workforce to help better address women’s needs as passengers - since the majority on buses are female. With so few women at the helm of Scottish transport firms, it’s encouraging to see at least some new additions.As well as lawyer and engineer Claire Gilmore replacing Ms Aitken as traffic commissioner, Caroline Donaldson was this week appointed as managing director of the West Coast Partnership Development, which will help devise plans for HS, whose trains are due to run on to Edinburgh and Glasgow.She joins industry leaders such as bus firm Xplore Dundee managing director Christine McGlasson, and Scottish Canals chief executive Catherine Topley - but there should be many, many more.

It led me to consider just how quickly time passes, and indeed how it appears to pass more quickly as one travels through the years.It also took me down memory lane of the  and  general electionsI mention all of this because I urge readers to not believe anything is as presented in a general election by the leading political parties – or the media, who often have an agenda to push or have bought into some utterly ridiculous spin on why things seem as they do. Thankfully The Scotsman has eschewed taking an editorial line on which party to support in preference to seeking out the truth. No, what appears political reality is often a mirage, a poor reflection of what is actually happening a  paradigm that a Timelord might discover bears no relation to what is in the history books.This is where we are in this general election. We have esteemed experts, partisan politicians and bookmakers on the make all trying to tell us what is likely to happen – and the truth is they really do not know. How many of them would take a £ punt on what they tell us is the likely outcome  They can look at national polling, even regional polling they can play around with Electoral calculus which changes the colour of constituency maps as often as a Chameleon and they can attend focus groups to consider what biscuit each leader might be in the minds of the electorate.Yet they still cannot say what will happen.The reality I work under is that while there are national moods and regional swings there are also localised iations, and when with less than three weeks still to go a general election is as close as this one could be, it is in a small number of seats where the outcome will be decided.Last week I met an old friend, the former MEP Tim Aker who was a UKIP general election candidate in his local constituency of Thurrock in  and . Tim swears that it is only because of the strong campaigning by UKIP in Thurrock that the Conservatives defeated Labour on both those occasions. The reasoning is simple but compelling, the electoral ision of Thurrock is strongly eurosceptic and all the more so in Labour wards. Tim polled especially well in Labour heartlands such as Tilbury, so well that Labour lost enough votes in a three-way fight with the Tories for the Conservative Jackie Doyle-Price to hold the seat with a narrow majority.It is what we might call the Thurrock Effect, for it is not limited to Tim Aker’s personal intervention but is repeated in a crucial minority of constituencies across the land. The Thurrock Factor is where the intervention of a third-placed challenger such as UKIP, or in today’s case the Brexit Party, takes so many votes from the Labour candidate that the Conservatives win when the expectation is they will lose. As I wrote last week, Boris Johnson should win, but it is his to lose and Theresa May has shown how easily the Tories can fumble the ball. Thus In a time when the outcome is anything but clear constituencies, where the Thurrock effect might transpire could be the dference between a Johnson and Corbyn government. Seats such as Greater Grimsby are suddenly looking like good prospects for the Conservatives. In this Labour seat polling tells us that the Tory support has remained steady while Labour’s has declined by % with the intervention of the Brexit Party taking some % of the vote. This is a classic example of the Thurrock Effect.Other seats could experience the same phenomenon – or at least come close to scaring the bejeesus out of sitting Labour MPs. Everyone in Bishop Auckland, even Labour voters, tell me the incumbent Helen Goodman is unpopular. The Brexit Party has a good candidate in Nick Brown who should do well and could provide an upset, buthe doesn’t then the Tory Dehenna Davison could benefit from his campaigning winning over Labour voters, leaving her to seize the day. Other English seats such as Keighley, Rother Valley, Dewsbury and Wakefield fit this format. The common factor is these are all northern seats, where the Brexit Party could win a handful of Labour fiefdoms – or make it possible for the Tories to benefit from their hard work. So much for the Brexit Party splitting the leave vote and letting Jeremy Corbyn in – but don’t expect Boris Johnson to thank Nigel Farage for standing candidates in such marginals. Only a fortnight ago Johnson’s lieutenants were demanding Farage stand more of his candidates down.In Scotland the existence of the independence question changes everything. With the SNP decimating Labour in  and Corbyn’s party only coming third after the Tories in  the debate about Brexit has less resonance than in England and Wales – but it still matters.With Brexit Party candidates withdrawing from all Tory held seats the latest polling suggests the Conservatives are doing well in Scotland while Labour could lose all but Edinburgh South. I will go further and suggest there will be a perverse McThurrock Effect – where Labour voters who cannot stomach Corbyn hold their noses and vote Conservative as the most attractive unionist party, ironically helping the SNP to retain those marginal seats.This would be important, for seven of Labour’s top twenty target constituencies in the UK are held by the SNP. You don’t need to be a time traveller to work out Corbyn winning the general election will only exist in some parallel universe.Brian Monteith MEP is Chief Whip of the Brexit Party in the European Parliament©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon questions whether westminster can block indyref2","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has questioned whether the UK Government is legally entitled to block Scotland staging an independence referendum, insisting: \"Its never been tested in court.\"The First Minister, who wants to stage a second referendum next year, has insisted it doesnt have to be a repeat of the chaos of the Brexit vote.

Puttin just walked in! , dead so far and no end in sight. It is a dangerous world, and the unguarded are vulnerable, the lessons of history are obvious to all but the foolish.I think there are folk who would locate blame for those deaths at the feet of the current US president and his America First approach. Trump, Boris and Brexit undermine international collaboration. Trump has weakened NATO and Boris weakens the EU#s capacity to stand up to his pet Tory-backing oligarchs in Russia.Can Ian peel the scales from his own eyes  Foolishness is imagining Britain can be great by standing alone. We only ever punched above our weight through cooperation with other nations, but we really have to be careful who those are. Saudis and US Republicans shouldn#t be writing our foreign policy. Let#s Get Brexit Done and see what happens next, heaven help us.Just a closing fact, the Salmond Sturgeon triest would have joined an indie Scotland to NATO. That would have allowed NATO nukes, including Trident into every Scotish port and Airport. Nice one for Lerwick and Sumburgh.#In the strawman argument, someone attacks a position the opponent doesn’t really hold#The strawman argument is a cheap and easy way to make one’s position look stronger than it is. Using this fallacy, opposing views are characterized as “non-starters,” leless, truthless, and wholly unreliable. ##The Ukraine conflict started in early .#Peter never claimed otherwise. Oh dear oh dear.Trump and Brexit are good news for Putin, less so Ukraine. More accurately I could have said there are those who would locate blame for some of those , deaths at the feet of the current US President.I#ll stand by saying Trump, Boris and Brexit undermine international collaboration though.Peace too.In fairness to Ian Tinkler though John, had I said there are folk who would lay blame for SOME of those deaths at the feet of the current US president and his America First approach. Trump, Boris and Brexit undermine international collaboration# then Ian would probably have happily agreed with me. After all Ian is a LibDem these days, which we all know is an excellent way to Get Brexit Done. I#m not sure I can agree with him that the UK should wage war in Ukraine again without the assistance of our fellow EU neighbours though#Perhaps there should be an advisory straw poll first man.Are you having a problem reading John Thomas  Or just an SNP iation with the truth You accuse Peter of dishonesty based on the fact that the conflict started in  . He did not claim otherwise. If he tried to claim it started later, that would be dishonest. But he didn#t. Classic straw man. Smells like SNP post-truth reasoning to me.

In addition, a programme of training has been introduced into communities and schools, with the ultimate objective to introduce ELS # Emergency Le Saving # training into every Scottish school curriculum.#To date, hundreds of defibrillators have been placed throughout the Highlands, members of the public trained in their usage and lives saved as a result.

I am sure there are loads of generous people out there so fingers crossed!#LuckyBHere founder Ross Cowie said: #This is a tremendous and very personal contribution from Malcolm who has been so supportive of Luckybhere since its inception.Backing like this really does make a huge dference” #Aye, even though I will be working part of the night!

The event, which also included a family and community fun day, marked the end of a year long refurbishment programme.The work commenced in October, last year when the main contractor Martin Hamilton, a Ballymena based company, arrived on site.Over the course of the next twelve months they completely transformed the inside of the church building as well as adding a new welcome hub.Over the past ten years the congregation has been thinking how best to provide st century facilities for a twenty first century church. Under the guidance of the design team of Kennedy Fitzgerald Architects, Williams  Shaw and Doran Consulting we have been able to take the project forward.The now current minister, Rev William Sinclair was called in September  and ministers along with associate minister Rev Matthew Boyd.First Ballymena Presbyterian Church was one of the first congregations to have an organ installed in the meeting house, and a new digital organ was installed during the current building project. Moving on from here, First Ballymena is a congregation that seeks to have a passion for Jesus Christ and a compassion for people. They want to engage with the community and be a compassionate church with a heart at the heart of the town of Ballymena. The new welcome hub helps open up the church and makes it an inviting place to be.Over the course of the past year, Matthew Boyd has joined William Sinclair in the ministry team and his main role is to strengthen the church’s mission in the community and to develop discipleship programmes in the congregation.Matthew Boyd stated his primary focus is on Discipleship and it has been encouraging to see just how God has been working in a number of people’s lives.Also as a church they have been going “over the wall” and engaging with people outside of the congregation who don’t yet know Jesus. It is the prayer of the church that God might continue to use them to reach out and point others to Jesus.

We move about  cattle and  sheep back and forth to our managed islands, as well as livestock to other privately-owned islands. In its first voyages, the new vessel will be used to bring livestock off for the winter.“We were delighted to be able to name it after Joe and it’s vital that we continue our work to provide ideal habitats for the curlews and other waders and wildle species in Lower Lough Erne. We are grateful to the European Union’s INTERREG VA Programme for funding this cot as part of CABB. A further aspect of the CABB project is to raise awareness in the community of the environmental, cultural and historical importance of these wetland habitats.”Joe added: “We originally used a wooden cot, which a farmer let us use. Then we built our own, although at first it had no engine on it and we had to tow it using another boat. So eventually we got an engine and that made le easier!“I knew that across the island of Ireland curlew numbers were dropping, so it’s important that work is still being done to look after them.”Thecot named the Joe Mageewill be used to transport livestock on and off islands, with the animals grazing resulting in an ideal habitat for breeding wading birds including the endangered curlewUnderlining the importance of this part of the project, Gina McIntyre, CEO of the SEUPB, said: “The curlew is one of a number of endangered priority species identied in the environmental protection measures within the EU INTERREG Programme. This new cot is a fantastic example of the tangible impact that EU INTERREG funding is having in safeguarding the natural environment and protecting endangered species, on a cross-border basis. Due to this intervention by the CABB project, curlews will have a much better future.

To be truthful I was in a very dark place. Irsquom not saying I was suicidal but probably close to it. ldquoI was . It was a strange thing. All I wanted to do was stay in the house and lock the door, but still the craving was there for company. Irsquod stand at the window hoping that the people walking past were coming for me.A collection was made of blankets and shoeboxes for SerbialdquoTherersquos a story going around about a person who was so lonely that he would post himself a letter just so the postman would come to the door to deliver it. That is very profound when you get to that stage. I wasnrsquot as bad as that but not far off it.Through Chest, Heart and Stroke, Robert found out about the Age NI club at North Road which ultimately led to his salvation: ldquoI turned up and what I saw actually amazed me ndash  elderly gentlemen discussing everything you can think of from finance to government to football to the shipyards.ldquoThis is exactly what I needed in my le at that time.ldquoThey were all strangers, and quickly became friends. Most of them have passed on unfortunately but we do have the present days menrsquos club. We still have  members and they are all fairly active and they are all great friends.Some of the participants at Age NI enjoying a game of bingoRobert said: ldquoYou have to take the step, but there is help thereyou do.ldquoAge NI do provide excellent help. Therersquos no doubt about it they go out of their way to encourage you to attend and to interact with other service users. And of course you have a meal here every day and a bit of chat.ldquoIrsquom here every day. Irsquom a service user two days a week a volunteer the other three days. Itrsquos such a wonderful service that I want to give something back.Robert, who used to work in the meat industry, commented: ldquoWork is important because it gives you a sense of purpose. Age NI gives you that same sense of purpose, a sense of being.You know there are people there willing to help you out.Discussing loneliness he said: ldquoThe loneliness factor is a strange one, you could be at a football match in a crowd of , and still be lonely.ldquoLe is so fast with the younger generation itrsquos hard to blame them for not checking on elderly neighbours. Itrsquos important for older people to look out for each other.Mabels storyMabel McCracken, who has been coming to Age NI for the past three years, agreed with Robert.ldquoEvery time yoursquore out you should say lsquohellorsquo ndash itrsquos important to be friendly, said the -year-old.Mabel told her story of how she came to be living on her own: ldquoI was a shorthand typist. I married my husband in . He was a cook during the war . We lived in Cyprus for three years and had two children ndash a girl and a boy, Michael and Anthea.ldquoMy dad was in a home and my mum wasnrsquot great by herself as she got older. I had orced and a got a flat in Clarawoodto be near my mum and dad. Now theyrsquore both gone.ldquoAll my aunts and everyone are gone except one cousin who comes to see me every Sunday and takes me shopping. My ex-husband is dead and my children, who live in Peterborough, come to see me every summer.ldquoWhen I broke my leg and was in hospital for six weeks I had to find somewhere  to live that was better suited to my mobility.Mabel, who now lives in secure accommodation for older people in east Belfast, said: ldquoHalf of the place is residents who canrsquot get out at all.ldquoIrsquom able to get out with my trolleyI order a taxi. Once a week I get picked up in the minibus and taken here. Irsquom the first on the bus.ldquoI really look forward to it, everybody is so good and nice. The people here feel like family. ldquoThe rest of the week gets very lonely. I watch TV but itrsquos not the same as talking with real people.ldquoItrsquos important to encourage people to take that first step out of the house, therersquos always help at the end of it.Wendy is head of a very happy familyAge NIrsquos day centre at the Skainos Centre is run by Wendy McKillion who is in the strange position of being lsquohead of the familyrsquo despite being younger than all of the people she cares for. The -year-old said: ldquoIt all starts when I have a referral from social services. I leave the centre to pay a home visit to assess the older people who really need to get out of the house, the people who are really isolated.ldquoIt is nice being in the position to offer somebody a social day at the centre ndash their lestyle improves as soon as they set foot through the door.ldquoTheyrsquore having a three-course home-cooked meal from our cook that we have on site. Jeanrsquos been with us for  years.ldquoBasically here at the centre the staff provide a good social day for service users. If theyrsquore having a good day wersquore having a good day.ldquoI have an open door policy that anyone at any time can come and have a private chat with me. They all have my mobile, they can get me any time and believe you me they do.ldquoItrsquos good security for them. If someone hasnrsquot turned up Irsquoll try to ring them or ring their next of kin, then go round and check on them.ldquoThey feel like my family. Some people only come in one day, some come in two, some come in three. It depends on inidual needs.ldquoIrsquove been looking after older people from I was in my twenties. It doesnrsquot get any easier when they pass away.Wendy, whose twin sister Gilly also works for Age NI, is full time with the organisation while many others lend their support on a voluntary basis:ldquoThe volunteers are worth their weight in gold. They could be semi-retired, they could be students, they could be people like Robert . All the time they give is appreciated.Recently Age NI teamed up with Blythswood Care to put together a relief package containing  blankets and  shoeboxes to be sent to Serbia.The group has had its share of celebrity mums with both Van Morrison and Dan Gordonrsquos mother attending.Proof that you donrsquot have to be alone to suffer from lonelinessLucy Quinn is proof that it is still possible to be lonely even when you come from a very large family.The east Belfast woman has eight children,  grandchildren and  great grandchildren.She said: ldquoI see my family very regularly but therersquos some days Irsquom just sitting in the house on my own. I bought myself a recliner chair and Irsquove got aframe to help me when I need to get up.ldquoIrsquod read magazines and do crosswords books to put the time in. I buy them to keep my brain active. Irsquod watch some TV as well.She said: ldquoI originally came from down by the shipyards. My father worked there and my brothers-in-law.ldquoMy husband died  years ago. He died aged  and one of my sons also died aged .ldquoItrsquos heartbreaking when you lose people who are very close to you.She commented: ldquoIt seems strange to say I get lonely when Irsquove got such a big family but loneliness isnrsquot straightforward.Lucy, who lives with her youngest daughter Karen, said: ldquoOne night Irsquoll have sevenin, sometimes there can be  or  of them in. You never know until they press the buzzer who will be coming.ldquoI have  grandchildren and great grandchildren. I think itrsquos  grandchildren and  great grandchildren.ldquoI give them all money for birthdays and Christmas. Therersquos too many to keep track of all their interests.ldquoThatrsquos how Irsquod spend most of my money. I save up. I donrsquot smoke and I donrsquot drink and I hardly ever go out.Lucy has been coming to Age NI for  years next May: ldquoThey used to be up in the North Road, I started off there.ldquoA girl called Valerie who used to the run the club, she said to myself and a couple of neighbours to come along. That was the start of it.ldquoIrsquom disabled, but not as much then as I am now.ldquoI love coming here. I come one day a week. When my daughters are all working it gives me something to look forward to.ldquoI love everything here, it would be the only exercise I get. ldquoThe cook is brilliant, Jean has been here since day one. ldquoThe craic is brilliant, I might be disabled but I can still carry on a joke.Older people in numbers in  older people are lonely in NIK older people in NI say that TV is their main form of companyAge NI has a total of  day centres across Northern Ireland.million people in the UK can go five or six days without seeing or speaking to anyoneThere are , people over the age of  living in Northern IrelandHow to help lonely peopleAge NI are at the forefront of change, enabling older people to have a voice and to remain independent, supporting those who need help in society and inspiring people to love later le.

Set in an old theatre in the s, the former St Genevieve’s pupil’s take on the festive and timeless classic will take families of all ages through a journey as they watch all the characters come together to show Ebenezer Scrooge the error of his ways.“The MAC’s Christmas audience is quite young so to introduce three ghosts can become quite scary so you have to work with that,” she said. “They always say write what you know and I know the theatre. I’ve set the story in a theatre where Scrooge is a producer, along with Jacob Marley they were the big theatre producers of the day. There is a term in threatre called the ‘ghost light’ this would have been turned on through the night so that people, who were still working through, wouldn’t have fallen through the trapdoor. I loved that idea and thought this would work as a way to introduce our ghosts. “This theatre, which Scrooge is in charge of, isn’t making the profit it used to the ghosts come to le in the hope that Scrooge won’t close down the theatre. The kids who will be in the audience are helping us create this story and it’s a way to introduce such a classic to a younger audience,” she said. Having starred in panto since she was , Tara Lynne will also be starring in Xmas For Dummies at the Grand Opera House with Chris Robinson, “an adult take on the classic ’s film Mannequin,” set in Castle Street.“It’s an hour of a show, either before or after your Christmas party to come in and have a laugh with us. I’m only in one of them so you’ll not be sick of my face,” she laughed.Having wowed audiences with her Shirley Valentine at The Lyric stage earlier this year, Tara Lynne exclusively reveals that her one-woman tour de force is coming back in  for a new run. “I’m really excited to be coming back with the show. The amount of feedback we got from people for a -year-old play was amazing. Everybody was coming up to me saying how they had ‘got a bit of Shirley in me’.“You could’ve heard a pin drop most nights in The Lyric. The support for the piece was unbelievable, it is such a gt of a show.”When not writing, acting or preparing to travel to ‘Greece for a fortnight’, Tara Lynne will be donning ‘Ma’s’ wig again as filming for Derry Girls series three gets underway in April.“I can’t wait to see what Lisa has instore for this series, I don’t think anyone can wait. It’s all very top secret at the minute. The scripts are so good, let’s hope I don’t get killed off or leave in a black taxi as that’s what happened me in Eastenders,” she laughed.

I remain focused on delivering for North Belfast.“It has generally been a positive campaign so far. The dynamic that this election transcends party politics is being received on the doors. That positive message about maximizing the Remain vote is being received very well.“We are running a very positive campaign by looking to the future by delivering better for North Belfast. It is an area as the readers will know that has been left behind and has many challenges. I want to be an MP to get stuck into those challenges.”Mr Finucane and his party have also faced criticism from opponents regarding Sean Kelly, the man convicted of the  Shankill bomb, who has worked as a party canvasser in North Belfast. However, John Finucane pointed to remarks by leading victims’ campaigner Alan McBride, who lost his we in the Shankill bomb, urging all political parties to be mindful of victims at election time.“Alan McBride is one of the most impressive people that I have met. He is considerate and well-measured,” said John.“His response to this debate is something everyone needs to listen to. I have and the party has, of being mindful and respectful of victims at election time. He has also called out the banners which are hurtful to those families who lost loved ones in the Shankill which I agree with.“He also called out the DUP hypocrisy on this issue – a party which has convicted drug dealers canvassing for them, engages with active loyalist paramilitaries connected with offences up to and including murder this year. Alan has been a strong and reasonable voice in this debate and I welcome his comments.”In an election that many see isabout Brexit, Sinn Fein’s long-standing abstentionism policy at Westminster has once again surfaced but Mr Finucane is adamant protection for the people of Ireland does not come from the green benches of the House of Commons. “It is an issue which has come up on the doors. Since the last Westminster election and the dynamic between the DUP and the Tories, there is absolutely no appetite by the British government to compensate or consider the impact of Brexit on the people of Ireland. It is not on their radar at all.“The DUP got spectacularly thrown under the bus and showed that no matter what your constitutional aspirations are, the British government simply does not careyou live in this part of the world.“Those who want to protect their European identity or voted to Remain – the protection is never coming from the green benches of Westminster. The protection comes from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney and the EU  and in America, supported by Sinn Féin.”John Finucane will contest a close-fought election contest with the DUP’s outgoing MP Nigel Dodds, someone many see as the chief architect of a hard Brexit.“Hewould be proud of that title. He was part of the Vote Leave campaign. He has been the DUP head at Westminster and is proud of his Brexit record.“The two defining political moments in my letime have been the Good Friday Agreement and Brexit and Nigel Dodds is on the wrong side of history in both of those. He continues to be opposed to the Good Friday Agreement and he continues to champion Brexit which goes against the majority of people’s views in North Belfast which is hopefully reflected on December .”Looking at local issues affecting North Belfast, the Sinn Féin candidate wants to address food banks, the mental health crisis, housing and anti-social behaviour, amongst others.“In North Belfast, we have food banks, a mental health crisis, reliance on prescription drugs, very toxic legacy from the conflict, suicide crisis particularly amongst our young people.“I don’t want to refight old battles or use the past to poke my neighbour in the eye. People want to move forward with political leadership that can do just that.”He said the DUP’s record on housing “is despicable”.“They object to housing for reasons that can be interpreted as nothing short of sectarian,” he said. “This is the brand of politics I think North Belfast wants to turn its back on. Housing is a right that is founded and based on need and nothing to do with religion, who you vote for or ethnicity.“North Belfast has a housing crisis – we are top of all the tables you don’t want to be top of and bottom of all the tables you don’t want to be bottom of.There are areas of land that need to be used for housing. There needs to be a major overhaul. We are up against a lot of opposition which the DUP are at the heart of.“Mental health, bonfires and anti-social behaviour are all linked in many ways. It is no surprise that those involved in anti-social behaviour come from economically-deprived and challenging backgrounds.“I was in the New Lodge this week and saw for myself the good work that is being done to remove people from engaging in anti-social behaviour. The community doesn’t want it. I think it was unfortunate this year to see the response of the police that eroded a lot of confidence from the local community.“Hard work needs to continue all year around. Statutory bodies, police and council all have a responsibility too. There is a lot of positive work happening – one example is the Féile dance night which takes young people away from bonfires.“From my day job as a solicitor, I know there are complicated reasons why people find themselves in the criminal justice system. The work has started and continues to operate all year around.”Asked about a border poll, John was quick to urge caution.“I don’t think we are ready for it tomorrow. The inevitability of a border poll is accepted and I say that, having listened to unionists. The mechanism is there in the Good Friday Agreement and we are close to the point when it will be called.“Brexit has shown you need to be prepared for a referendum and people need to be clear what they are voting for and what they are voting against.” also saw John Finucane installed as Lord Mayor, becoming the First Citizen of Belfast after he was elected to Belfast City Council in May and he says he has been encouraged by the fantastic work he has witnessed right across the city.“I was given advice from Tom Hartley who said you only think you know your city and he was absolutely right.“I am from the best part of the city – North Belfast – but really I only knew it geographically. I have seen the fantastic work that goes on in communities across the city that I wasn’t aware of. None of it gets much attention but I am very encouraged by the vision for this city, which is happening North, South, East and West.”As a former county footballer and the current goalkeeper for Lámh Dhearg, John suffered heartbreaking defeat in the Antrim Senior Football Final against Cargin last month.“I have tried to make sure this defeat isn’t talked about again,” he says. “It was a tough one to take but a season that won’t be forgotten in a hurry.“We had some really good wins over Creggan and Portglenone but just came up short in the second final against Cargin after extra-time.”The Sinn Féin man is determined not to come up short again when the votes are counted on December ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated.

Aged , he is married to Martinaand they have an eight-year-old daughter Eliza..pushQ: How did you meet your we A: We met in Blackpool when we were both teaching in a very large school. She is originally from Victoria Bridge in Co Tyrone and had gone to Preston to do a degree and became a very successful business studies teacher.Initially we were just colleagues - although being a fiery Greek I fell in love with her immediately. When we started going out we decided to keep our relationship a secret and it was two or three years later in  that we told the other teachers that we were getting married later that year.Q: What had brought you to England A: I grew up in a town called Polykastro, outside Thessaloniki, Greeces second largest city, which dates back to the time of Alexander the Great. Most of the real Greek feta cheese that you will eat is produced around my home town. My grandfather was a dairy farmer but with goats and ewes, not cattle.Christos Gaitatzis, principal of Omagh High SchoolMy dad was in the merchant navy but when he met my mum he started up a small garage and I have two brothers, one of whom is in the Greek army.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetI did well at school but when it came to A-levels I was not sure what I wanted to do.I considered medicine or entering the military academy.I always loved a challenge and then the idea of going to university in England came to me.There were no tuition fees to pay then and the European Union had opened the doors for students to travel abroad.Q: What did you study in England A: I went to Sunderland university and studied pharmacology and I did well, gaining a : degree. Being in England was the challenge I was looking for. I obviously met a lot of new people and experienced new cultures. It was the first time I had met anyone from Ireland, India, Pakistan or even France.Q: What was your next move A: Initially I had planned to go into biochemistry but then the idea of teaching took hold. It was something that would keep me occupied.I liked the idea of coping with people of dferent backgrounds, being involved with dferent topics and dealing with a large number of people on a daily basis. That to me is the biggest challenge in le and where could I get that challenge - in teaching.Q: How did your teaching career develop A: I was a big fan of football in the s and I began to follow Blackburn Rovers and that led me to do my teacher training in the north west of England where the team was based. I simply chose where I would go based on the success of a football team as I did not have any connections anywhere in the UK.I did my teacher training in Preston and began work as a physics teacher. My first school was a small Catholic school - very similar in size to Omagh High - in Leyland in Lancashire. Then about four years later I moved to a Church of England grammar school for boys in Blackpool and then later became vice-principal of another Blackpool school. It was an area where there were high levels of deprivation.Some years later I followed the principal of that school to an independent fee paying boarding school in a very affluent area and became a senior teacher there. That was my last job before coming to Omagh.Q: Had you been to Northern Ireland before A: Martina and I used to come here regularly to visit her family and we would spend time on holiday here. Other years we would holiday in Greece. When the job of principal at Omagh High came up last summer I decided to apply for it. We knew we wanted to bring up Eliza near family and spend more time together. That was more important than being away from home no matter how many other opportunities there were.Q: What are your impressions of your new school A: I came from one extreme to the other. The independent school was in a very affluent area and that was reflected in the school. In Omagh there are concerns over the condition of the buildings and maintenance issues. But it is no dferent from what many other schools here are experiencing.Omagh High SchoolQ: What  do you know about the school A: It was the first controlled non-selective school in Northern Ireland to get an outstanding award during inspection in  which was a great accolade and that level has been sustained up to the last inspection in May this year.Q: What are the challenges you face as principal A: While the school has set very high standards it has multiple challenges. The fabric of the building is past its sell-by date. It needs signicant investment to keep it looking good but we are trying to sustain a good level of presentation of the building.We are waiting to get into a new school on a new campus with five other schools in the town. Hopefully that will happen within the next decade.Q: What is the ethos of Omagh High A: It is a co-educational non-selective school with a very open perspective. Everyone is welcome in the school and there are a signicant number of pupils from a Protestant background and a good number of Catholic pupils.I find the pupils are not so keen to talk about religion as much as parents might be. I feel it is a totally integrated school.We also have a number of children, -, who come from Europe and dont speak English. We spend a lot of time with them to help them.Christos Gaitatzis, principal of Omagh High School Q: What are your hopes for the pupils of Omagh High A: I believe that -% of the pupils are of very high ability and could go on the universitythey wished. We have a whole spectrum of abilities and that is very important to us.That is what we want to promote and we want to offer every pupil a quality education and care. Outstanding care and education is a part of what we do every day. I am happy to tell parents that their children do not need to go to a selective school to get a good education or to become well rounded iniduals.Q: So examination results are not everything A: No. Pupils should get extra value added to their lives by the time they leave school. We want every student to rise and rise as they go along the educational process and this is achievable in a non selective school by taking heed of the abilities of each student.Q: What do you think of integrated education A: I am a big believer in non-selective and integrated education. That is immense for this province in order for us to become better. I genuinely believe mixing kids of dferent backgrounds is very good in a societal context. The staff of a school define the space and the standards andyou have staff of high quality - like we do - that sets the tone.Q: How has the squeeze in public funding affected schools A: There are several effects. Staff salaries have increased by -% over the past  years but there has been no real increase in funding per pupil. Increases in pension contributions and National Insurance contributions have had to be absorbed by schools.This has made things very dficult for a number of schools and there are now more schools in budgetary deficit than are in surplus. The cost of things like books and energy have gone up three, four or % which is another challenge when income has not risen.Christos Gaitatzis, principal of Omagh High SchoolFor us in Omagh, schools were supposed to be on a new campus by now. That means that maintenance issues have become worse and are going to be very expensive to fix and that will have a high impact on my budget. We are trying to squeeze water out of a stone. Very recently I discovered that the space beneath our assembly hall resembled a swimming pool. Some central heating pipes had broken and flooded the area. So our maintenance people had to work all weekend to pump out the water and fix the leak. I had  kids doing mock exams and they had to be switched to the sports hall.Q: Does the lack of devolved government make the problems worse A: The lack of politicians and the lack of decision makers play a role. No matter how good the Permanent Secretary of the Department is or how hard he works some decisions have to be taken by elected representatives.The politicians need to get together and start taking decisions for the good of the people, not for their own good. They have to stop thinking about their personal careers and start representing the people and start talking to each other. Yes there is a crisis.Q: What  impacts on the schools A: Industrial action has taken place over the past number of years and that has resulted in us not being able to intervene on certain things. We work on the goodwill of staff because of that industrial action.Q: You present a very challenging future A: There are multiple problems and they can cause a chain reaction. But we are optimistic because we are in this job to make kids good leaders and good learners so they can make this world a better place than it is.There has to be a clear indication of where we are heading and when. We are using our own human resources to get through the storms - we are walking barefoot in the snow.Q: How are you settling into Omagh as an inidual A: Northern Ireland is one of the friendliest and warmest places I have ever been, although I am not talking about the weather, but rather the hearts of the people.I am of the Greek Orthodox faith and in Preston we had a very small community but it grew and eventually we got our own church.That is one of the things I am missing in terms of my spiritual work and guidance - not having my own church and priest.I have to say my prayers alone or go to the churches of my we or my friends. I can go to any denomination.Q: Are you still a big football fan A: I am a qualied basketball coach and I have always loved the sport. I played for the north Greece team at under- level and still support Aris Thessaloniki. There is a basketball team in Omagh and maybe I can get involved with it because I love the sport.Q: Tell me something unusual about yourself A: My surname means bagpiper and my grandfather was a bagpiper. I cannot play but my younger brother who is in the Army plays it.School factfileName of school: Omagh High SchoolFounded: Number of pupils: Number of teachers: Notable for recent successes: First controlled school in Northern Ireland to be awarded outstanding status .This accolade consistently confirmed in follow up inspections . Consistently achieving GCSE and A-level results above the Northern Ireland average for similar schools.Motto: Outstanding Care and Education is at the heart of what we do!"},{"url":null,"title":"joshua garrett 9 has cracked egg market and is now eyeing up future with","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Furthermore, the lack of effective marketing to attract visitors until the recent MEABCShaped by Sea and Stone tourism campaign, has meant that Slemish Mountain is another under-utilised outdoor recreation site with considerable potential in the borough.\"The report recommends the development of \"a professionally-designed, sustainable and sensitively built path from the base of Slemish Mountain to the summit and a looped walk around the mountain that incorporates surrounding historic sites connected to Saint Patrick\".It adds: \"These actions would maximise the outdoor recreation potential of this signature natural landmark by improving safety for walkers and making the summit more accessible to a broader range of visitors, such as families who are weary of the current slippery nature of the path in wet weather.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/7857c/BINARY/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates and delays","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was followed by St Kevins College in Enniskillen in st place with .%, and, both in joint nd place, St Catherines College in Armagh and St Michaels College in Enniskillen with .%.Dalriada School headmaster Tom Skelton said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the results.\"Its a fantastic achievement for the staff and pupils involved,\" he said. \"To take every child over the line with % five A*-C represents a lot of hard work and the support of parents as well.\"Two years ago we were % as well, so were delighted to get up there again. I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort. Its about hard work and dedication,\" he said of its joint ninth place.Principal of Castlederg High School Elaine McKelvey said she was \"delighted\" it was the highest-ranking non-grammar school in the league table.\"These results are testimony to the excellent provision for learning made at Castlederg High School by a highly dedicated staff, working in partnership with very supportive parents to ensure the best possible outcome for each young person,\" she said.Mrs McKelvey paid tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff during \"a most challenging period for educational delivery within all schools in Northern Ireland, given the shortfall in capital funding and inequitable remuneration for teaching staff\".\"Most of all though, we are tremendously proud of our pupils and their achievements, noting the breadth of opportunity for the future that such excellent exam results have created for them,\" she added.The Department of Education said the information contained in the league table relating to GCSE results \"does not provide a valid basis for comparing performance between schools, since it takes no account of intakes of the schools or of any other factors that may affect pupil performance\".It added: \"No single measurement can constitute a fair or accurate evaluation of a school, and the figures should be considered in the context of other information about schools and their pupils.\""},{"url":null,"title":"chief rabbis view of corbyn backed by northern ireland jewish leader","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In certain circles that is a bad word. I get the feeling the majority of what they call the left-wing middle-class circle that Corbyn would belong to, dont believe the state of Israel should exist.

I dont think hehas much support. I dont know too many people who would support a Labour Government under Corbyn. In fact, I dont know anybody.\"Mr Black reflected on how he and his community have been subject to anti-Semitism here in Northern Ireland in the past, and how in most cases it is related to ignorance about the Jewish faith.\"Ive had abuse online because of my background. We have also seen issues in Belfast. There are a small number of people who wouldnt see my point of view,\" he added.\"There is a lot of ignorance as well. People say things not necessarily meaning anything, but just through ignorance. I meet people who have never actually met a Jew before. It is not part of their le. They wouldnt understand and know the things I would be involved in.\"It would just be another world to them.\"Askedhe had any personal advice for Mr Corbyn, Mr Black urged the Labour leader to strike a balance in his comments and \"be a bit more critical of the other side\".He said: \"Fair enough, be critical of the government of Israel, but I never hear them criticising the likes of Hamas, Hezbollah and the Palestinian leaders.\"Labour has hit back at the Chief Rabbis claims and insisted: \"Jeremy Corbyn is a lelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no one who engages in it does so in his name.\""},{"url":null,"title":"constituency profile brexit health and investment highlighted as big issues on the road to election in fermanagh and south tyrone","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The SDLP were out in force on the ground in the Lower Ormeau and the Markets this week.SDLP’s Claire HannaAs her partys most high-profile MLA on broadcast media, and with personal and family links to the constituency dating back decades, Hanna has a strong hand generally.She is also fortunate in her main unionist opponent. In neighbouring East Belfast, DUP MP Gavin Robinson has kept a relatively low-profile. He hasnt antagonised those who didnt vote for him.The same cannot be said of Little-Pengelly in South Belfast. When she was elected, she had the opportunity to build bridges with nationalists and others in this most erse constituency - as an act of self-preservationnothing .DUP’s Emma Little-PengellyInstead, she became involved in rows over bonfires and UVF flags. It was unwise to antagonise those who otherwise might have developed a civil relationship with a reconciliatory and progressive DUP MP.Yet Little-Pengelly certainly cant be written off in next months poll. She has a fine electoral track record in this constituency. She increased her partys vote by an impressive % between  and , something for which she is given insufficient credit.She is a prodigious constituency worker. Despite Ulster Unionist Michael Henderson standing, she should secure a massive unionist vote.DUP Balmoral councillor David Graham is running her campaign, and doesnt think it is a lost cause.\"Emma got over , votes last time, and there is room for growth in our core area,\" he says.\"If you compare our  bestboxes in the constituency with the top  nationalist boxes in  - when we did exceptionally well - there was still a far higher proportion of people in our best areas who didnt vote or werent even registered.\"Weve done a lot of work on the ground to change that, and unionist voters are very motivated for this election. Emma grew unionist turnout in , and we need to do that again. I think we will as people realise it has never been more important to defend the Union.\"Graham also cites the outgoing MPs grassroots endeavours: \"Emma has dealt with over , cases in her office in her two years as an MP. Christopher Stalford is a hard-working MLA and we have an excellent council team locally. That helps us hugely.\"Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw The key to the DUPs chances is how Alliance fares. If the Remain camp is fairly evenly split and Hanna doesnt pull signicantly ahead of Bradshaw, then Little-Pengelly should win.Support for Bradshaw next month is dficult to predict. The SDLP was , votes ahead of Alliance in . Yet the Naomi factor and the partys extraordinary success in the EU election may have changed the dynamic.Alliance surged ahead of the SDLP in Mays council poll. But the fact Bradshaw stood as an Ulster Unionist Conservative candidate in  might limit her reach more than it would an Alliance candidate without such a history.Ray Kennedy was the SDLPs election guru in South Belfast for two decades. He ran Alasdair McDonnells campaigns. He says: \"This seat is now Claire Hannas to lose. But I think it will be tight at the top with the SDLP just edging it over the DUP, and Alliance coming a good third.\"Alasdair won around , soft unionist votes in . I reckon theyre in doubt, with these voters perhaps switching to Alliance or staying at home.\"The SDLPs perceived pact with Sinn Fein doesnt help as its being sold by others as a sectarian pact.\"However, Kennedy sees Hanna winning support where. \"Claire wont get % of the Green vote, but she will get a fair chunk.

key-questions-over-the-release-of-usman-khan-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph news uk article.ece e AUTOCROP h bpanews_e-f-a-a-baeb_EmailThe terrorist murders committed by Usman Khan have raised questions over the early release of certain prisoners and the efficacy of rehabilitation programmes..push– Why was Usman Khan released half way in to his sentence Usman Khan and two other men, who planned to raise money to build a terrorist training camp in Pakistan and recruit Britons to attend it, were originally given indeterminate jail sentences for public protection.Khan was ordered to spend at least eight years behind bars, at which point he would have been assessed for release by the Parole Board and,found safe, be released on licence for at least  years.If not, he would have been kept in prison, potentially for the rest of his le.However in  Khan and his co-defendants, Nazam Hussain and Abdul Bosher Mohammed Shahjahan, all from Stoke-on-Trent, successfully appealed against their sentences.They argued that they had been unfairly classed as more dangerous than other members of their terror cell, who were plotting to bomb the London Stock Exchange.So Khan was instead given a fixed jail term of  years, with an extended licence period of five years.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Usman Khan was automatically released after serving half his jail term This meant he was automatically released after serving half his jail term, but would have remained on licence after release for  years.If he broke the conditions of his release during this time, he could be sent back to prison.– Would the Tories’ proposed changes to automatic release affect a case like Khan’s The Conservatives say criminals sentenced to at least four years in prison for crimes which carry a maximum le term would no longer be released at the halfway point.Instead, those offenders will be required to serve two-thirds of their sentence behind bars.For a case like Khan’s, the type of indeterminate sentence that he received was scrapped in , and the current equivalent is an extended determinate sentence.Under that system, defendants given terms of less than  years are already automatically released after serving two-thirds of their sentence, so the changes would not affect them.– What attempts were made to stop Khan re-offending Khan appears to have hoodwinked the authorities into thinking that he had changed his ways.He was attending a Cambridge University conference on prisoner rehabilitation when witnesses said he “flipped” and launched his attack.The event was part of the Learning Together scheme, which allows offenders and students to study alongside one another.Previously, while in jail in , Khan wrote an apparently contrite letter to the Home Office asking to take part in a deradicalisation programme, and claiming that he had been “immature” when he committed his offences.He said that he wanted to live as “a good citizen of Britain”.However, it has also been reported that he refused to take part in deradicalisation programmes while in high security jail Belmarsh.On release, he would have taken part in the Government’s Desistance and Disengagement Programme, that aims to stop offenders taking part in terrorist activity and to move away from terrorist ideologies.He was also wearing an electronic tag at the time of the attack, which is designed to enforce curfews, and reportedly would have had to report his plans to travel to London to police."},{"url":null,"title":"is there a doctor on board the new selfdeprecating meme taking

Chair of DTUC, Niall McCarroll, has taken the opportunity to extend an invitation to citizens throughout the city. Niall McCarroll DTUC Chairperson says: DTUC invites all citizens to come along to our Workers Hustings event, a hustings which will provide an opportunity to show solidarity with those workers currently taking strike action and to engage in a question and answer session with the candidates standing in the upcoming Foyle constituency Westminster elections.Conveniently, the narrative for this election is that the British withdrawal from the EU is the main issue in which people should focus and vote accordingly. The establishment political classes systematically set the narrative, attempting to dictate and control. This hustings will give people, and specically workers the opportunity to discuss the real matters at hand. Matters such as cuts to health, education and the diminishing right to social equality and le chances, through poverty pay and the relentless attacks on terms and conditions of employment.The narrative at the DTUC hustings will be set by workers including teachers, classroom assistants, civil servants, Community and Voluntary Sector workers, youth workers, hotel workers, nurses, and Health and Social Care workers, everyone is welcome.DTUC send out a message of solidarity to all those workers struggling under a system which values only the system. A solution needs to be found through a determined revolt, inspired by a trade union movement workers led revolution.The accessibility of liberty, free from oppressive restrictions would seem to have been achieved for all, but is this the case  When a child goes to school hungry, to a school unable toeffectively due to a lack of resources, where is the ownership of that childs le  Health and Social Care services are collapsing but so too is society, collapsing under the rule of capitalist governments, depriving working class communities of true liberty and opportunity.Working class communities deserve better, workers deserve equality, now more than ever we need to organise and mobilise, a class war is raging and key battles lie ahead. This is what this election should be about, fighting back and electing those who will stand up to the establishment, breaking the mould, not just becoming part of the establishment when elected.Workers and their families need both political leadership and solidarity.

Chair of DTUC, Niall McCarroll, has taken the opportunity to extend an invitation to citizens throughout the city. Niall McCarroll DTUC Chairperson says: DTUC invites all citizens to come along to our Workers Hustings event, a hustings which will provide an opportunity to show solidarity with those workers currently taking strike action and to engage in a question and answer session with the candidates standing in the upcoming Foyle constituency Westminster elections.Conveniently, the narrative for this election is that the British withdrawal from the EU is the main issue in which people should focus and vote accordingly. The establishment political classes systematically set the narrative, attempting to dictate and control. This hustings will give people, and specically workers the opportunity to discuss the real matters at hand. Matters such as cuts to health, education and the diminishing right to social equality and le chances, through poverty pay and the relentless attacks on terms and conditions of employment.The narrative at the DTUC hustings will be set by workers including teachers, classroom assistants, civil servants, Community and Voluntary Sector workers, youth workers, hotel workers, nurses, and Health and Social Care workers, everyone is welcome.DTUC send out a message of solidarity to all those workers struggling under a system which values only the system. A solution needs to be found through a determined revolt, inspired by a trade union movement workers led revolution.The accessibility of liberty, free from oppressive restrictions would seem to have been achieved for all, but is this the case  When a child goes to school hungry, to a school unable toeffectively due to a lack of resources, where is the ownership of that childs le  Health and Social Care services are collapsing but so too is society, collapsing under the rule of capitalist governments, depriving working class communities of true liberty and opportunity.Working class communities deserve better, workers deserve equality, now more than ever we need to organise and mobilise, a class war is raging and key battles lie ahead. This is what this election should be about, fighting back and electing those who will stand up to the establishment, breaking the mould, not just becoming part of the establishment when elected.Workers and their families need both political leadership and solidarity. The DTUC Workers Hustings will provide the Foyle constituency candidates with an opportunity to listen to workers and detail why a vote for them is a vote to fight, a vote worth giving.Out of the seven Foyle candidates, four have confirmed attendance, Anne McCloskey , Colum Eastwood , Elisha McCallionand Shaun Harkin .Darren Guy , Gary Middleton , and Rachael Fergusonall said they had made prior arrangements and therefore couldnt attend. googletag.cmd.push The DTUC Workers Hustings will take place at UNISON Hall, Clarendon Street, Derry, on December  at pm. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

CONAL McFEELY says the findings have been both enlightening and compelling. In his seminal book, ‘Derry: Countdown to Disaster’ , the former Derry Journal editor Frank Curran catalogued how fty years of isolation and discrimination led to the outbreak of the Troubles in this city. Recent events, such as the failure of political governance, the collapse of the institutions, and the uncertainty over Brexit here, are being used by some sections of the media to suggest we are now in danger of a similar spiral. googletag.cmd.push The reality on the ground in communities such as Creggan is that there is, admittedly, huge frustration. Despite the peace process, Creggan - along with many already disadvantaged areas of Derry – has never escaped a legacy of endemic poverty, joblessness, housing problems and low educational attainment. This is now compounded by anxiety over Brexitand the political vacuum here, which has left many people feeling voiceless and powerless. But, for all the dissatisfaction and exasperation here, there is no appetite whatsoever on the ground for ato what our community experienced during the troubles. googletag.cmd.push There is no doubt, however, that we need help. Urgently. And, importantly, we need long-term solutions – not short-term fixes – to reverse and redress the politics of economic isolation. Local people know of old that it is pointless waiting on Stormont to intervene on our behalf. Even in the new, post-Good Friday Agreement era of equality, this city overall has continued to experience economic isolation.  So, what is needed for Creggan   Surveys conducted at Rath Mor over Autumn  established, the community wants: middot A fresh, current and strategic vision for the area. Creggan needs a comprehensive long-term plan to reassess and revise its approach to community development with a view to enhancing the physical, mental, economic, educational and social well-being of its residents. middot Support for community infrastructure, capital and physical environment projects to help address social and economic exclusion, improve community image, grow new business, tackle poverty, advocate for those in need, create new employment and stimulate social innovation. middot Support for a targeted social enterprise strategy to promote civic engagement and community ownership. Creggan will always struggle to attract inward investment, instead we need a viable stimulus package for indigenous business. The ethos is not just about developing sustainable businesses – it is about contributing to the social and economic profits for the advantage and benefit of the local community. middot Support for a new Intermediate Labour Market initiative. Creggan needs a dedicated ILM scheme – providing sustainable jobs and experience, skills and qualications which are most in demand by employers. The scheme should be highly focused on helping those iniduals most in need, and most at risk. middot Support for inclusive development vehicles. It is imperative that any new support service, or targeted employment or skills building initiative be inclusive and independent. It must be implemented delivered by a neutral mechanism, engage with all sides of the community and be pragmatic about removing barriers to work and supporting personal transition. middot Continued support for health and wellbeing initiatives. Creggan suffers from a range of signicant physical and mental health challenges, and despite this Creggan has been devoid of a dedicated doctor’s surgery for over  years. Creggan Enterprises have been working diligently to bringing this service provision to the area for the last decade. January  will see the realization of this new flagship health project for the community in partnership with Bayview Medical. Government or independent funding support should be directed at these types of projects which provide meaningful, tangible and most importantly sustainable benefits to the community. middot Support for schools, families and young people. Creggan needs targeted and focused early years, youth and parentalprevention and intervention programmes which are fully inclusive and engage those most in need, at risk, marginalised or excluded from existing provision. middot Support for programmes which engage the elderly, address social isolation and support those most vulnerable in our community to the impacts of poverty, austerity and cuts as a result of failure in political governance. middot Support for inclusive community dialogue. Without the opportunity and  for dialogue we are left with continuous community isions and conflict. And whilst Creggan has suffered very negative media coverage and ‘community profiling’ in recent times – there is a sustained need to develop viable community safety initiatives which are fully inclusive an accountable to everyone. middot Support for initiatives which deal with the past. At the centre of much of Cregganinter and intra-community conflict – is the community’s inability to tackle legacy conflict issues – lacking an effective mechanism for dealing with the past. middot Support for new educational and cultural partnerships. Creggan over the past few years has been hosting regular Summer School schemes for international visitors – as has partnered on peacebuilding projects with the likes of Yale University, Boston College, Temple University, John Moore and many more – tying in with their political science, international studies or peacebuilding  conflict studies courses. We would seek to broaden out this offering and formalise this Summer School as a standalone initiative. Creggan, and Derry in general, needs a st century recovery programme, particularly in light of the potential catastrophic impact of Brexit on the North West. And whilst financing, job creation and early intervention prevention-based work is at the core of any important proposal – every effective development plan needs flagship projects to stimulate public interest, generate healthy debate and communicate a vision, for example: A new, independently-run university Derry needs a new university. A new, independently-run university – which would come under the auspices of the National University of Ireland and be supported by the Irish government – is one certain way to begin redressing the balance. It would also serve as a beacon of hope for those who cannot see their future in this city – and it would serve as a declaration of intent of the Irish government’s commitment to Good Friday Agreement. A university’s letime can run into centuries – Derry, this island’s most ancient Christian settlement, needs a guarantee of its longevity and of a prosperous future. Regardless of what happens after any election now or next year – we must ensure that our young people have access to enhanced economic and educational opportunities going forward. Time is long overdue to address community abandonment and short-termism by central government.

Jarvis, who has publicly thanked the Dundalk fans for their support during his two years at Oriel Park, admitted that his desire to be closer to his family is one of the main factors in deciding his next move. “I have been chatting to a few teams,” he admitted. “Im  with a young family so I want to move closer to home. “Living away from my family and travelling up and down to Dundalk was hard. I have to take all that into consideration.“Ive chatted to Paddy McCourt but nothing has been finalised. I have had deeper discussions with other teams and Derry are still in the pack.“ I remember at the start of last year Deckygot in contact with me. I was in his plans then. Tiernanat Larne was the same last year as well, and even before I signed with Dundalk, but it all still has to be decided.”Still only , Jarvis has won more than many players manage in a career, but he is still hungry for more success, and his continued ambition is something which must be matched by his next club.“One of the main reasons I left Derry was because I thought I had a better chance of winning stuff,” he admitted. “I went down there and I couldnt ask for any more because Ive won everything available in the past two years so it was a good decision from that point of view.“The whole standard of the group and inidually was high. “Everyone was always trying to push on knowing that we were trying to win the league at the start of each year. We wanted to win everything. “Last year we started out looking to win the treble and we were a penalty shoot-out away from that. “Wherever I go next Ill be looking for the same standard. It might not be the heights of Dundalk because the last two years it has been unbelievable but wherever I go Ill be pushing to do the same and hopefully using my experience to help the group.”First team footballJarvis admits he is in no hurry to make his mind up, but first team football, something he constantly battled for at Dundalk, is another key factor whichever team he chooses.“The end of last season didnt go as planned,” he stated. “At the start of the season I was in the team and playing well and hoping to kick on - wherever I go I want to be playing every week, and do my best to start every week and thats not going to change.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The property also benefits from an integral garage.A key feature of the island is the direct road access to the mainland via Castle Island Road and onto Strangford Road which connects Strangford with Downpatrick.The new owners will share the island with Quoile Yacht Club, which offers some of the finest facilities in Strangford Lough, and the Quoile Pondage Nature Reserve and Bird Hide.The enclosed garden and grounds at the house extend to . acres and slope from the house to Castle Island Road and include manicured lawns and mature trees which provide shelter and amenity. There is also a small gravel area next to the house with trees and shrubs.An extensive block of farmland lies within a perimeter fence and is well suited for the grazing of livestock and production of silage hay.Estate agents Osborne King say that while nestled in private surroundings, the island conveniently lies a short distance from several towns including Downpatrick.While there is an abundance of amenities on the island including wildle, and sporting opportunities, there are also plenty of interest points nearby, including Castle Ward and Delamont Country Park.Gavin Clarke, from Osborne King, says the property has been on the market for over a week and is already generating interest from potential buyers.ldquoThis delightful property would make an ideal second home or, alternatively, a main family residence, given its tranquil location and magnicent views, with the Mournes to one side and Strangford on the other, he said.ldquoThe current owners have lived there for around  years and while they are very sorry to see it go, they look forward to seeing others benefit from it. The bungalow is ready to walk into as it has been well maintained down through the years.Gavin added: ldquoWith a couple of viewings in the pipeline, it would be nice to sell this side of Christmas.Further information is available from the Osborne King office, Donegal Square South, Belfast on    or email property@osborneking..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Businesswoman.jpg","title":"Businesswomen mentor Assumption students  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH students have taken part in their first management programme that promotes womenrsquos capacity for leadership.Over  sixth form girls at Assumption Grammar School spent the day recently shadowing female leaders in a range of industries including financial services, recruitment, law, media, construction and health, last month.SistersIN Female Leadership Programme, was launched this year to help foster girlsrsquo confidence in leadership roles.Organisers say it gave those taking part an opportunity to work alongside a female mentor at CEO, director or partner level across several trades in which women continue to be underrepresented at the top.Projects and communications assistant Hannah Magorrian said: ldquoAfter spending the day with mentors, the students develop their leadership skills in school, leading initiatives including mental health, peer mentoring, photography, sport, music, drama, debating, literacy, creative writing, religion and coding.ldquoThe school hopes these pupil-led initiatives will provide a legacy that benefits the whole school and wider community.ldquoIn line with the ethos at the heart of Assumption Grammar School, the pupils have already spent time with female leaders in local charities.She continued: ldquoThe school is currently working with its sister Assumption schools in South Africa to develop a parallel initiative with the aim of empowering African girls to become future leaders.ldquoThis global aspect of the SistersIN programme is reaching out to a country where females are vastly underrepresented at senior management and executive levels.The SistersIN Female Leadership Programme is being piloted in Assumption Grammar School this year, in association with Women in Business.Pupils will have two further leadership experience days, working with female leaders, on February  and June  when they will gain a dferent experience of leadership from one of over  partner industries..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Celebration.jpg","title":"Celebration time for Aughlisnafin  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN GAC held their annual presentations and dinner in the Burrendale Hotel last Saturday evening with Armagh and Crossmaglen Rangers legend Oisin McConville as the special guest.Major awards were as follows: seniors mdash managerrsquos player of the year, Donagh Steele managerrsquos sportsperson, Sean Fitzsimmons playersrsquo player, Donagh Steele.Minors mdash managerrsquos player, Morgan Croskery managerrsquos sportsperson, Peter OrsquoHare playersrsquo player, Ben Ogle.Senior players Oran Flanagan and Oisin OrsquoToole, received a commemorative league winners shield, on behalf of the squad, which has the names of every player and the management team engraved on it.The senior  and management team were also presented with league and championship medals and the minors were presented with their All County league medals.There were two recipients of the club person of the year award mdash chairperson Sheena Murray in recognition of an outstanding first term in her role and also Gerard Lenaghan in his role as coaching officer and PRO.The final award of the evening was presented to club vice-chairperson and senior player Rory Murphy in recognition of his outstanding contribution over the past  years.Oisin McConville was then invited to say a few words and spoke well with excellent advice for the future and encouraging rank and file members to put their shoulders to the wheel.There is much to do in a growing club and help is vital to sustain the clubrsquos development.

Many from Kilmegan and the surrounding areas tragically paid the ultimate price on a foreign field and are remembered in the book.Chapters on the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, the Troubles, the loyalist and IRA ceasefires and the Good Friday Agreement take the history of the parish into the modern age.Hundreds of hours of painstaking work researching historical documents and the archives of local newspapers, including those of the Down Recorder, were involved in the production of this book which will undoubtedly be regarded as an important point of reference for current and future generations.In a typically noble and generous gesture the Kilmegan and Maghera Historical Group have decided proceeds from the sale of the book will go to the Childrenrsquos Heartbeat Trust.Copies are now on sale at Walkersrsquo newsagents and JRrsquos Discount Stores, Castlewellan, with details of further points of sale on the Grouprsquos Facebook page, Kilmegan Maghera..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Jasmine.jpg","title":"Jasmine\u0027s first Christmas without a home  ","story":"JASMINE Carbery is one of the many unseen homeless people in Northern Ireland.She looks like any other young woman you may notice walking along Market Street in Downpatrick mdash bright, full of le and full of chat.Yet, at the young age of , she will spend Christmas at the Simon Community house in Saul Street away from her family for the first time.She moved into Saul Street in August after staying in the Newry Simon Community hostel a few months before that.Jasmine is one of three young women living in the Saul Street house. So far she is doing well and enjoying her new le in Downpatrick.Jasmine was asked her to leave her home earlier this year. Her parents have not been in her le for some time.ldquoLiving in Downpatrick is alright. Irsquove actually made a few friends outside the hostel which makes me happy, said Jasmine.ldquoThere was a breakdown in the family relationship. I was working but then I needed to have some serious surgery on the back of my neck and I wasnrsquot able to work. Thatrsquos what led to the breakdown and I was asked to leave.What Jasmine says next is said in a calm, non-emotive manner.ldquoBecause I hadnrsquot been working, I didnrsquot have much money to contribute to the house. Also because I have two rare medical conditions, I had been on preion painkillers for them for over a year now. Irsquom actually addicted to them. It was probably another factor in why I was asked to leave.Jasmine was born with whatrsquos known as a Chiari malformation, a condition in which brain tissue extends into the spinal canal as well as Syringomyeli, another condition where a cyst or cavity forms in the spinal canal.Her recent surgery was to correct the growth of her brain into the top of her spine.She adds: ldquoWhile I was living in Craigavon, I was going out with a guy who was a drug dealer but I had never taken drugs before that. When I became homeless, I started taking drugs, mainly cocaine and tablets, as they were all around me.ldquoI suppose itrsquos a bit of an escape as well as many people see homelessness as rock bottom. But the prescription painkiller addiction would be my biggest problem and I suffer really badly with my mental health.Jasmine relationship with her relatives is still fragile, although there has been some infrequent communication between them.Living in a hostel has had some high and low points for her.ldquoSimon Community hostels are used as bail hostels but they are not exclusive to just prisoners, she said. ldquoI have never been in jail, never been arrested and would be classed as a vulnerable person.ldquoYou donrsquot really know who you are living with in a hostel as therersquos all sorts of people. That makes you more apprehensive.ldquoMy experience is that there have been predominantly male residents in the two hostels I have lived in. I was the only girl in about - fellas in the Newry hostelrsquos main building, so that took a bit of getting used to and was quite scary. Here is smaller, so itrsquos not as bad.ldquoBut the staff are amazing here. They go above and beyond their job description for you. They will sit and talk with you, watch the TV with you, play a board game, cook for us, everything we need.Jasmine left school at  with some qualications and has been told she is bright, but she has not been able to complete other educational courses, mostly due to her medical condition.However, she has recently been working with the human rights charity, Participation and the Practice of Rights, to help others know their entitlement in seeking social housing.She is being supported in the hostel for her problems and will be soon working with an Community Addiction worker.Jasmine has some goals for the New Year ahead which she hopes to achieve, again with the support of the Simon Community team.ldquoI would love to get my own place, thatrsquos my number one priority, she said. ldquoI would like not to be taking drugs and I also would like to reconnect with my family and get back into some education..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Lecale.jpg","title":"Lecale and Downe Historical Society launches annual publication  ","story":"THE Lecale and Downe Historical Society launched its th annual journal at the Down County Museum last week.Lecale Review No , has proved to be another excellent mix of compelling articles of local interest, published just in time for Christmas.The latest annual charters the history of one of the oldest racecourses in the world outside Downpatrick.The story penned by Joan Magee, lsquoHorse Racing At the Flying Horsersquo tells how a handful of gentry held a horse race around  but little  is known of the occasion.Within  years, the Earl of Ardglass and other noblemen petitioned King James II to set up a Royal Corporation of Horse Breeders within the county.All its members were to be known as Freemen and it had the power to meet in Downpatrick or some other Co Down town every Tuesday of Easter week.As well as having permission to race, the corporation was also permitted to hold a horse fair too.Joan explains that a race transpired at the Flying Horse, Downpatrick, on March ,  and is especially signicant as this race marked the beginning of what is one of the earliest flat racing courses in the world.The winner was Colonel Byerley, who fought at the Battle of the Boyne four months later against the platersquos donor ndash King James II.Another interesting article written by Colm Rooney charts the history of cinema within Downpatrick.Colm reveals that while Belfast had over two dozen cinemas, Downpatrick finally welcomed its first, the Pavilion Picture Theatre in St Patrickrsquos Avenue, at a glitzy opening ceremony on Wednesday June , .It was a huge event for local entrepreneur, Downpatrick man, William Tweedie who watched as locals queued up to pay over one shilling to see the Prisoner of Zenda, the first movie ever shown in the cinema.The cinema later moved to Market Street in the early s with the Breen family taking over the running of the business around , which ran until the s.Another article, Downpatrick by Gaslight, written by Andy Gilmore, reflects on the journey of natural gas over the centuries in Downpatrick.Andy points out that the use of town gas in Ireland dates back to  when gas for lighting streets and homes began to be produced from coal.However, it wasnrsquot until , and a concerted effort by the townsfolk that led to the foundation of a gas company that brought the energy source to Downpatrick.A site on Market Street was agreed for the gasworks in  and it opened later that year.

First off, there is no such thing as a wasted vote and saying that is actually quite disrespectful to how important having your democratic say is.ldquoIn addition, a lot has changed since the  election results and Alliance in particular has shown this year that it can win against the odds ndash polling well ahead of the UUP and SDLP in the most recent NI-wide election in May. To continue with the horse racing analogy, Alliance might just be worth a punt at the bookies this time around.Mr Brown said that most importantly, voting isnrsquot about keeping anyone out and is not about having to choose between two parties you donrsquot really like that much.ldquoFrankly,all a party can offer the electorate is lsquo you donrsquot vote for me, yoursquoll get themrsquo, they shouldnrsquot be running in the first place, he continued.ldquoI am standing for election because Alliance represents the values and ideas I want to see in politics here mdash liberalism, a shared society, environmentalism, human rights, transparency, internationalism and economic justice. Win or lose, every vote for Alliance is a vote for those values. That is never a waste.Mr Brown said he is asking voters to think about the values that best reflect what they want to see in politics, their identity and their views.He added: ldquoIt is my bet that a lot of people will join me in rejecting tactical voting and demanding better instead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Top.jpg","title":"Top acts make it through to county Scor decider  ","story":"ST Michaelrsquos Hall, Finnis, was filled to capacity on Sunday evening for the East Down Scor na nOg finals.The talent on display was outstanding, the entertainment was superb and the judges had a dficult task in deciding the winners of the ious categories.In the ceili dancing section, Dromara emerged as the winners with Castlewellan the runners-up.The solo singing section was won by Niamh Savage, from Portaferry, and the runner-up was Caithlin Fay, from Ballygalget Camogie Club.The recitation and story telling category produced a Dromara one-two with Olivia McKay winning ahead of Emma McKey.The ballad group category went to Saul with Ballygalget in second place.Drumaness were the winners of the novelty act and in the instrumental music category St Paulrsquos took the honours ahead of Darragh Cross.The winners and runners-up in each section go through to this Sundayrsquos county final in St Patrickrsquos College, Banbridge, where they will take on the representatives from South Down..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 TV.jpg","title":"TV’s Christine opens unique autism centre in Carryduff  ","story":"TV star Christine McGuinness opened a ldquofirst of its kind autism centre in Carryduff last Tuesday.Built by the National Autistic Society in Northern Ireland, the pound, centre at East Bank Road has been purpose-built for autistic people and their families, providing day provision for autistic adults who need high levels of support from across Northern Ireland.The centre will benefit those in and around Belfast and beyond, providing autistic adults with complex needs a safe and welcoming place to learn, socialise and fulfil their potential.It has been developed to encourage social opportunities, relaxation, sensory stimulants and lelong skills, among other positive key principles for its autistic visitors.Christine, a mother of young children with autism and we of Top Gear host Paddy McGuinness, is an ambassador for the National Autistic Society.She said: ldquoI was honoured to open the amazing National Autistic Societyrsquos Northern Ireland Centre in Belfast.ldquoThere are around , autistic people in Northern Ireland and not enough services to support the needs of autistic adults with complex needs.ldquoThe National Autistic Societyrsquos new centre will provide a safe and welcoming place where autistic adults can learn new le skills and build their confidence and independence.She added: ldquoThe centre will be a leline for autistic people and their families across Northern Ireland and a place for autistic adults to reach their full potential.Shirelle Stewart, director of the National Autistic Society Northern Ireland, said: ldquoWe were thrilled to have Christine McGuinness open our new autism centre.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

While it generated an income of more than £k, a whopping bill of £, employee costs ate up the club’s annual takings.Outgoings included the cost of premises at £,, transport costs of more than £, and supplies and services costs of £,.At Silverwood Golf Course the net cost for   was almost £,.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/buil1.jpg","title":"nine storey office scheme for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew A new proposed nine-storey office building in the heart of Belfast city centre could house up to  workers once completed, Ulster Business can reveal. There are now plans to build the grade A office building at Victoria Street. It would see the current Chancery House building knocked down to make way for the development. In , the building was sold off in excess of its guide price of £.m following a competitive bidding process. Chancery House, which is located on the edge of Belfast’s Law Courts and opposite Victoria Square Shopping Centre, was purchased by a local private developer. The fresh planning application has been made by Chancery House Investments Ltd, which includes Northern Ireland businessman Darren Donnelly as a director. Its being designed by Todd Architects alongside planning consultancy Turley. The building would include more than , sq ft of grade A office space, and those behind it have said it “would assist in addressing an identied need in the marketplace for small office floor plates to primarily serve indigenous businesses which are expanding and want a city centre business location”. It also says the design of the development “has been carefully formulated and responds to the immediate context of the site and its surrounding”. “The proposals improve the setting of the Old Town Hall and define its location with a building which adds vibrancy to this important nodal point”.

He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/515/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"employers must be transparent about pay gaps to retain staff in ","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business One of the many interesting insights to come out of this year’s Hays UK Salary  Recruiting Trends report was the strong view that employees are no longer happy to just accept seemingly arbitrary decisions from their employers about pay rises, writes John Moore managing director of Hays NIOur survey found that salaries in Northern Ireland are generally increasing at a faster rate than the UK averagedue to competition for talent, though salary rates for most roles in NI remain lower than in other parts of the country.In Northern Ireland, % of employers said they had increased salaries in the past year and % said they expect to hire more staff in the year ahead. But four out of five of the organisations we surveyed said they had experienced some sort of skills shortage in the past year and were finding it hard to recruit people of the right quality. While that should be good news for those employees with those in demand skills, the survey shows that among people who are looking for jobs or considering a career move, the issue of transparency is really important. Nearly % of employees said they want their organisation to be more transparent about pay levels and how pay rises or bonuses are awarded. Demonstrating the disconnect, more than % of all organisations acknowledged they weren’t consistently transparent with all employees about how salaries are set. It’s a situation that can lead to suspicion and damage morale in a workforce and could in turn have an impact on both retention and hiring.Of those we surveyed in NI % were dissatisfied with their salary, mostly because they felt it didn’t reflect their inidual performance. Just % of employees received a performance related bonus and only % of those who asked for a pay rise were successful in getting one. Employees can’t always expect a pay rise or bonus, butthere is no clarity over why some people are receiving them and others are not, then it’s likely to create discord. Perceived gender pay gaps in particular are very much in the spotlight and have the potential to impact retentionemployers aren’t up front about them and able to demonstrate that they are addressing the imbalances, which unfortunately still persist in many industries.Of course, as I’ve said in this column before, it’s not all about money. While % of those surveyed would be tempted to change jobs due to the salary and benefits package on offer, candidates again reported it’s a complex decision. Career progression is the second most common reason people would move and a third of employees said work le balance was the most important factor in choosing new roles. This confirms regular reports from employers that more candidates are choosing not to move beyond initial enquiries or withdrawing from recruitment processes when they don’t feel a role fully meets their expectations. Younger candidates in particular are confident they have options and want to know an organisation lines up with their own values.This has all led to skills gaps that are affecting productivity and project delivery. Four out of five employers we spoke to said they’d experienced a skills shortage and almost the same amount said they’d found it hard to recruit permanent staff in the last yearThe survey clearly shows there is competition for the best talent in a number of sectors, especially for some specic roles in technology and finance. That has driven up overall salary levels and in  employers will need to better articulate what dferentiates them from their competition to have a chance of recruiting these in demand people.In a competitive market, being clear on pay and showing that you are addressing pay gaps will be an important factor in the success of your recruitment plans.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
