Photograph: iStockEmissions from Irish power-generation and industrial companies increased by 15 per cent in 2021, according to preliminary analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).This compares with an increase of about 9.1 per cent across Europe.The increase in emissions amounted to 2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent and was largely due to increased carbon intensity of Ireland’s electricity production last year.The increase provides further evidence of how difficult it will be to halve Irish emissions by 2030 as committed to in the Government’s national climate action plan.“Several factors came together to compound this – a decrease in wind power availability, some relatively modern gas-fired plants being offline and an increase in electricity demand,” the EPA concluded. Older plants, including the coal-fired power station at Moneypoint, Co Clare, had to be used to ensure sufficient power was available.The data released relates to greenhouse gases emitted by industries that are part of the EU emission trading system (ETS), which the EPA monitors as the competent authority in Ireland.In the Republic, 105 major industrial and institutional sites were required to report their emissions for 2021 by March 31st under the ETS. These include sites operating in the power-generation, cement, lime, and oil-refining sectors. Also included are large companies in sectors such as food and drink, pharmaceuticals and semi-conductor manufacturers.“Ireland’s ETS sector delivered a decrease in emissions from 2017 to 2019, largely due to the higher level of renewables on the national grid, and again in 2020 because of Covid-19,” said EPA director general Laura Burke.She added: “The increase we are seeing for 2021 . . . is disappointing and is a reminder of the need for policies and decisions which support sustained emissions reductions in power generation and industrial emissions. The challenges faced in the power-generation sector are in sharp focus at the moment. We must ensure we are taking decisions now which recognise the urgency of the climate change challenge and that will deliver reductions in emissions.”Aside from power generation, the increase in industrial emissions collectively was 7 per cent, cement industries recorded a 17 per cent increase overall, while emissions from pharmachem industries increased by 3 per cent.Aviation emissions from flights within the European Economic Area increased by 11 per cent compared with 2020, amounting to 5.3 million tonnes, but this is still much lower than the pre-pandemic levels of 12.8 million tonnes.Some restructuring of routes has taken place and the operators of the new routes may not be reporting to Ireland, but emissions data reflect that recovery of the sector was slow in 2021, the EPA noted."},{"url":null,"title":"charlie bird thanks supporters as more than 2m raised for charity","story":"Broadcaster Charlie Bird with members of the Defence Forces on Croagh Patrick in Co Mayo on Saturday. Photograph: Paul Allen and AssociatesPACharlie Bird has issued a message of thanks to everyone who supported Climb with Charlie events all over Ireland on Saturday.The former RTÉ broadcaster was joined by family, friends and supporters for a charity climb up Croagh Patrick in Co Mayo.Thousands of people across Ireland and in other parts of the world organised their own events on the day, with all proceeds donated to mental health charity Pieta House and the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association.According to RTÉ, €2.2 million has been raised so far.Mr Bird announced he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease last October, and the condition has already greatly affected his voice.On Sunday, Mr Bird said on Twitter that he was “completely blown away” by the amazing support from all over Ireland and abroad. “I cried so much yesterday, but they were all tears of joy. A big loving hug to everyone. Thanks everyone.”He added: “I can tell you we are going to go beyond €2 million raised.”Mr Bird also sent a special thanks to his RTÉ colleagues, saying he loved them all. “You have me proud. Jim Fahy and Colm Murray, I am sure were smiling down on all of us yesterday.”Hikes were organised in more than 150 locations across Ireland on Saturday, with some people joining in from abroad in places such as the United States, Canada, England, Australia and Dubai.Mr Bird was joined on the climb up the Reek by his wife, Claire, and his daughters, Orla and Neasa.The Late Late Show presenter Ryan Tubridy, singer Daniel O’Donnell, former boxer Barry McGuigan, musician Matt Molloy and celebrity architect Dermot Bannon were also in attendance.Mr Bird lit five candles at the top of the mountain, one for women’s health campaigner Vicky Phelan, one for everyone with a terminal illness, one for everyone in a dark place with their mental health, one for everyone involved in the fight against Covid and one for the people of Ukraine.The campaign will continue for the next three months so iniduals and community groups have time to return funds to the campaign.Donations are still being accepted at climbwithcharlie.ie.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"mardi gras in mayo as charlie bird s carnival winds up croagh patrick","story":"Climb with Charlie: Barry McGuigan, Ryan Tubridy and Charlie Bird on the summit of Croagh Patrick. Photograph: Conor McKeownThe Celtic gods of Lugh and Danú may have been confused by Charlie’s carnival caravan as it wound its way up Croagh Patrick in resplendent sunshine on Saturday morning. This pyramidal peak overlooking Clew Bay is usually associated with penitents and the Reek Sunday pilgrimage on the last Sunday of July. It may be the season of Lent but it was more Mardi Gras in Mayo as benevolent weather gods stayed mainly in check for the 764 metre-high ascent for some 10,000 people who joined the Climb with Charlie.As Chieftain Matt Molloy mused shortly after he landed in the carpark at the mountain’s base in Murrisk: “What a release after the last two years of confinement and everything we have been going through.”An Air Corps helicopter had delivered all the instruments and technical equipment to the peak on Friday but Molloy was happy to carry his flute up himself.Volunteer Maria O’Malley, who was helping direct traffic into the carparks, explained that there were over 50 people - one third of the population - from her native Clare Island waving from the top of the Big Hill across the bay.Across the carpark, Tom Tiernan, from Ballinrobe, had a van full of hazel sticks , to aid walkers and a shoebox for donations.“I lost a sister to motor neurone about ten years ago.She was a nurse and was sick for five years, it was an awful disease,” he said.Meanwhile, Charlie’s family and friends gathered in the garden behind the adjacent Campbell’s pub.Speaking to The , Charlie’s wife Claire Mould, said: “This is a very spiritual day for us. We had climbed it six years ago and really the whole thing has happened because of a throwaway comment by Charlie after his diagnosis. We are just overwhelmed by the response and the benefits it will bring to the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and Pieta.”Along the pathway, Joe Freeley from Ballyhaunis was ready and waiting with doves for Charlie to release, as he, and his entourage, set off on the odyssey shortly before 10.30am.“I’ve climbed the mountain loads of times and I wanted to be here to support Charlie. We released doves in Ballyhaunis too recently for the Ukrainian people,” he explained.Dublin native Ciarán Callaghan was climbing in memory of his father who died from motor neurone disease 14 years ago, aged just 58.“I think Charlie has created a great awareness nationwide and after my Mam signed me up, we raised €2000. If I survive the climb, I’m meeting her and the kids in the Tavern bar down the road for a big lobster dinner,” he said.Broadcaster Ryan Tubridy may have landed a little late but himself and former boxer Barry McGuigan were determined to catch up with Charlie and bounded up the lower slopes like two March - oops! - April hares. McGuigan later likened Tubridy to “a gazelle”.The sun may have become more tentative but the children from Brackloon NS were waiting for Charlie on the shoulder, about half way up.Pupil JJ Kenny (9) said: “Charlie called to our school on Thursday and he gave every pupil an elbow. He is brilliant.”No better man than Donegal crooner, Daniel O’Donnell to act as MC as the hordes negotiated the final approach of slippery shale on the precipitous peak.It didn’t matter about the cold mists - a magical micro-climate - sporadically enveloping the peak. Nature held its breath as Charlie’s message of hope - a recording made with special cloning technology - boomed across the skies.Referring to his “mad idea” to climb the Reek, he said that “you never know what is around the corner” but that “for every moment he is around he will extend the hand of friendship to people”.The poignancy continued when Daniel sang the Bruce Springsteen song, “Dream Baby Dream”, which had been played at Charlie and Claire’s wedding in 2016. But it was a song called “Irish Heroes” written by Des Cafferkey of the Clew Bay Pipe Band in the aftermath of the Rescue 116 helicopter crash off Blacksod that left Charlie Bird breaking down in tears.He wasn’t the only one.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"marina litvinenko no one believed putin monster sasha showed","story":"It must be tempting for Marina Litvinenko to slump into despair after western leaders failed to heed her endless warnings about the true nature of Vladimir Putin.Sixteen years after her husband Alexander was murdered by Russian assassins on British soil, the invasion of Ukraine was proof of how little presidents and prime ministers have learnt from the past.“The West became too relaxed,” she says. “They thought: ‘Putin is a b------, but we know how to work with him’. They were wrong.”Yet Marina remains remarkably upbeat as she chats about her past, present and future, showing the strength of character that has got her this far, and which she still believes will see her facing Putin in the International Criminal Court one day.Her biggest ambition in life is “to live longer than Putin, and one day see him tried for war crimes and for the murder of my husband”. The war in Ukraine might even have brought that day closer.For now, though, Marina has a rather more introspective mission at hand. She and her son Anatoly are about to begin work on a joint memoir about Alexander, about his murder, and about the international criminal investigation that has dominated their lives ever since.Anatoly was just 12 when his dissident father died, and Marina believes the process of writing a book together will not only help them to relive cherished memories of Alexander, but also confront unresolved, unspoken elements of their grief.“Anatoly was definitely traumatised by his father’s death,” she says of the boy who was taken to see Alexander as he lay dying in University College Hospital, “but he was very protective of what he was feeling inside. He didn’t cry, and it was only when he got older that he started to talk about it.“When we write this memoir together it will be interesting to hear maybe for the first time his feelings about what happened, from his perspective.”Anatoly, now 28, still lives with his mother in their small flat in West London. He has been working as a paralegal but has decided his future lies in IT and is about to embark on a course in computer coding.Marina and her son talk about Alexander – or Sasha, to use the Russian diminutive form – “a lot” and she has always tried to impress on him the fact that “yes, your father died, but in some way he is with us”.Keeping Alexander’s memory alive, of course, has been a highly public affair for Marina, but not one which came easily.“I’m a very private person,” she says, “and I’m always really surprised when people recognise me in the street, though they are always very polite and generous.“What I do in public, I am doing for my husband, but it doesn’t come naturally. When he was lying in that hospital bed I refused to do any interviews. Sasha said I should do them, and tell people what was happening, but I thought he was going to recover so I never thought I would need to.”Before his death at the age of 44, Litvinenko dictated a statement to be read after his passing, in which he said: “You may succeed in silencing one man, but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life. May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people.” Putin’s blood-curdling reaction to Alexander’s death was to say: “The people that have done this are not God, and Mr Litvinenko is, unfortunately, not Lazarus.”A public inquiry chaired by Sir Robert Owen concluded in 2016 that Litvinenko had been the victim of a Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly KGB) assassination “probably” approved by Putin.It named two Russian agents, Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitri Kovtun, as his killers they had slipped a lethal dose of the radioactive substance polonium 210 into a pot of tea drunk by Litvinenko when they held a meeting with him on Wednesday, November 1, 2006 at London’s Millennium Hotel.Litvinenko told Marina that as he sipped his tea, “in one second he realised something wasn’t right”.Twenty-two days later, he was dead and she believes that if he had finished the cup he might have died very quickly, meaning the cause of his death might never have been detected.Two days after the meeting, he was admitted to Barnet General Hospital, before being transferred to University College Hospital on November 17 when his condition worsened. Doctors diagnosed acute radiation syndrome, and on November 23, after losing consciousness, he suffered a cardiac arrest and died after attempts to resuscitate him failed.And so he became the key witness in the investigation into his own murder. The public inquiry was a personal triumph for Marina, who had spent an entire decade pushing for it, despite the obvious risks to her own safety from taking on Putin and his hitmen.I ask if she feels she has to spend her life looking over her shoulder, but she says she has never had bodyguards and refuses to allow security concerns to constrain her.“In 2006 I was given close communication with the police, which meant I could always contact someone 24 hours a day, and I still have that access, but I don’t really need it,” she says.“I do pay attention to what happens around me – if I see the same person cropping up too many times I might want to know why.”Later this year a four-part ITV series, starring David Tennant as Litvinenko, will dramatise the murder and Marina’s fight for justice, which she hopes will bring the story to a new audience too young to remember the scarcely believable events of November 2006.Anatoly acted as a consultant for the series, but contractual obligations elsewhere meant she could not be involved in the production. Did she meet Tennant? She blushes and smiles, which gives away the answer, even though the official version is that they have never met.Marina, who will soon celebrate her 60th birthday, retains the unmistakable poise of her former life as a ballroom dancer (she still teaches dance), and sits straight-backed on the edge of a sofa as she sips green tea at a hotel near her west London home.]She recalls her first meeting with Alexander, in 1993, when he was working for the FSB investigating organised crime – she was 31 and he was 30.“I had heard about him before I met him,” she says, “and I was really quite surprised when this very young man arrived, looking quite shy. He certainly wasn’t what you expect a KGB man to be!”She was meeting friends for drinks on her birthday (“I always joked afterwards that he was my birthday present,” she says) and Alexander accompanied a friend of hers who was nervous about her safety because of her involvement in a case he was investigating.“Sasha gave you so much confidence. He supported you, he protected you, you felt very confident around him, whether you were his wife, his friend or his child. I never thought I could feel so loved, so protected and so happy.“He was always very open-minded, open to anything new. I never thought I would find all of those qualities in one person.”She also, of course, remembers the last time they spoke, and tears prick her eyes as she recalls leaving his hospital bedside to go home to Anatoly for the night.“I told him: ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon’,” she says. “He said: ‘I love you so much’, and he looked so sad. I tried to make a joke by saying ‘finally you tell me!’, but it was the last thing he said to me. Two hours later he was unconscious.”Campaigning for justice can be lonely work, and Marina does not rule out marrying again one day, saying the idea of having another relationship “isn’t a problem to me”, but that any suitor would have to realise that “Sasha will always be in my life, so it would have to be a strong personality to accept that because most people want to be the only one”.At the start of our interview, before bombarding her with questions about her husband, about Ukraine, about Putin, about Roman Abramovich and so much more, I ask her if there are any particular messages she wants to get across, and her answer comes as a surprise.“Firstly, I’m worried about Russophobia,” she says, without pausing for thought. “Of course I support sanctions against Russia, but now people don’t even want to play Russian music, they want to boycott Russian composers. It’s stupid. The past 100 years have not been good for Russia, but it is also the country that produced Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev.”She accepts that it might seem odd to some people that she is so passionate about defending the country that murdered her husband, but she believes that “there may be a chance for Russia to become a different country” in future.Could she ever see herself going back to a Putin-free Russia if a modern-day Gorbachev were to take over one day and bring about a new glasnost?“When I left Russia I didn’t think I had left forever,” she says, recalling the couple’s arrival in the UK as political refugees in 2000. “There were people who left during the Cold War that knew they were leaving for good, but for me I thought it was going to be temporary.“Now, though, I would be more happy to go to live in Ukraine. It’s a very similar culture I have friends there and there will be plenty of work to do in rebuilding the country once the war is over.”She praises British people for being so “welcoming and open” to taking in Ukrainian refugees, but warns that “they need to be serious about it. “It’s not just about being generous it’s about being capable of supporting people who are traumatised, who have just come from a war zone. People also need to be prepared to be in this for the long haul you can’t just reject someone after a couple of weeks.”She does not have space in the small flat she shares with her son to be able to house a refugee, but is acting as a liaison for others who want to open their homes. She admits the war took her by surprise – a few days before the invasion, Moscow-born Marina was in Ukraine visiting friends in the south-west of the country.“I didn’t think there was going to be an invasion at all,” she admits, “or certainly nothing beyond the Donbas region. There were so many reasons for Putin not to do it, especially the effect that sanctions would have, that I thought he would hold back.”She says the West has been guilty of a collective failure to see Putin for what he is – “someone who has turned Russia into a mafia state and then a terrorist state” – because successive leaders have convinced themselves they knew how to handle him.“During the Cold War it was simple, because the West didn’t really have any personal relationships with Russia,” she says. “But after glasnost the West started doing business with Russia, private companies got deeply involved, personal relationships formed and they wanted to give Putin the benefit of the doubt.”She recalled George W Bush’s meeting with Putin in June 2001, when the US president said he had “looked the man in the eye” and found him to be “straightforward and trustworthy… I was able to get a sense of his soul”.“No-one believed the president of Russia was a real monster,” she says, “but he is and my husband Sasha tried to show it before his death, and he tried to show it through his death.“Russia carried out an act of nuclear terrorism on British soil by murdering Sasha, and it should have been a watershed moment, but it wasn’t.“In 2010 the new government of the UK gave Russia another chance to build its relationship, and more money came in, big donors with Russian surnames gave money to the Conservative Party. It was a big mistake.”She fears the West will become “fatigued” with the situation in Ukraine, and that President Volodymyr Zelensky will accept a peace deal that would be too advantageous to Russia.“It might suit western leaders to push Zelensky into agreeing everything Putin wants so that they can move on, but the Ukrainian people would not accept that, so it won’t be over.”She even suggests that Zelensky’s position as president could be in doubt if he is too accommodating, despite his Churchillian popularity at present.It is Marina’s misfortune that she knows more about Russia’s use of poisons than almost anyone else in the UK, so what does she believe happened to Abramovich, who claims he was poisoned while acting as a go-between in peace talks?“I believe this is all part of a propaganda exercise to frame Ukraine,” she says. “The Russians have already tried to suggest that Ukraine has chemical weapons so that they can stage false flag operations if they want to, and I think Russia will tell its people that Ukraine has tried to poison Abramovich.She believes that ultimately, Putin’s miscalculation in invading Ukraine could have profound consequences for him. “Russia could break up it’s such a huge country that it’s a nightmare to govern, as history has shown.”As for the war, she is concerned that Putin could use battlefield nuclear weapons, but thinks he would not risk all-out nuclear war because “he doesn’t look like a kamikaze he likes his money and his yachts too much”.Even if Putin were to give the order to use tactical nuclear weapons, Marina still has enough faith in the country of her birth to believe his soldiers would refuse to carry out their orders.“My husband refused to carry out orders to kill people,” she says. “I still believe Russia has heroes.”More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: New mass grave containing 57 bodies found in BuchaSacramento shooting: At least six dead after attack in CaliforniaDisgraced ex-SNP minister Derek Mackay will give evidence over Nicola Sturgeon’s ferry scandalLiver cancer treatment that ‘bathes’ organ in chemotherapy is effective in 90pc of patients\u0026#39Two Russian soldiers dead and 28 in hospital\u0026#39 after eating poisoned pastries from Ukrainian villagersFarmers reject ‘reckless’ study which likens harm of red meat sector to tobacco and fossil fuelsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"american dream disintegrating eyes","story":"Over the last decade the American presidency has passed from a man who arrived at his Inaugural shaking his fist in the air like a tinpot dictator to one who carelessly inserts dangerously impulsive remarks into crucial diplomatic speeches. What on earth is going on here?Of course, the United States, like all mass democracies, has had some pretty poor leaders over the centuries. Those figures who embodied the great moments in its history - Jefferson, Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt - are memorable because they are rare. But what is happening now seems like something more than a routine spell of mediocrity which will pass with the coming of a new generation.What is wrong with the presidency seems more closely connected to what is happening in the wider society: nothing less than a collapse of the political culture which affects the daily lives of ordinary people in ways that failures of the federal power structures rarely have.It is important to understand that throughout much of the country’s history, the complexion and competence of the government in Washington had relatively little bearing on the everyday quality of local American life. The quite explicit design of the Constitution guaranteeing states’ rights ensured this. It was the clear intention of the Founding Fathers to limit the central authority of Washington which was seen as a threat to the self-determination of citizens almost on a par with colonial rule. The explosive confrontations between federal and state authority over the abolition of slavery and, a century later, the enforcement of racial integration, were the most vivid examples of this but disputes over abortion and gun laws still revolve around that basic principle, built into the nation’s idea of itself, of state autonomy.Very rarely, in fact, has the quality and tenor of the presidency seemed so closely aligned with the state of the nation in ways which can be felt in the streets and the homes of real people. The demoralisation and paralysis in Washington plays out in everyday experience. There is endless news coverage of crime, racial violence and civil disorder on a scale that many Americans believed until quite recently was behind them, as well as the continued decline of what would once have been thriving industrial enterprise. But much more ubiquitous and bewildering is the sense that the idea of an American mission - the country’s original idea of itself - has disintegrated. The collapse of that self-belief, of the accepted understanding of what America was for, is stunning.But, you may ask, what is so different and dangerous about this? After all, identity crises of a similar kind have occurred in many countries - particularly former imperial powers which have had to come to terms with their role in a changed world order. There can be a temporary nervous breakdown and then a recovery which reframes a country’s goals. Why shouldn’t this formula which appeared to work in so many European countries apply in the United States with its famously enterprising and adaptable population? Because America is different. I would venture to say that it is much more different from any Old World society than most Europeans appreciate. In the sentimental twentieth century, there was understood to be an American Dream which animated the hopes and aspirations of those millions who arrived there in search of safety, freedom and economic opportunity. The real truth is that America itself was a dream: its national identity, and the patriotism which was a mandatory part of it, was a beautiful fiction created by a small group of people and sanctified by a handful of superb documents which enshrined the 18th century idea of liberty under the law.Most pertinently, this new entity was intended to bind all incomers from anywhere in the world into a cohesive society which was prepared to accommodate anyone who would sign up to the social contract that was on offer. (This is precisely how the Constitution is taught to American schoolchildren: as a contract between the government and the people.) This was an unprecedented political project. Not even the original French revolution which based itself on a similar Enlightenment foundation had done anything like this: attempted to invent an entirely new nation composed of disparate, displaced people which would somehow cohere into a proud unified sense of statehood and inidual belonging. And miraculously, for the longest time it worked. The patriotic rituals which most Europeans found faintly absurd, if not positively sinister, like the pledge of allegiance to the flag which began every school day, served their purpose. The children of immigrants, many of whom, like my grandparents, spoke only the language of the Old Country, went to school and learnt - like my father - to speak English. They became proud Americans who wanted more than anything to belong to this new thing that they felt a part of and were told that their commitment had helped to create.True, there was a constant tension between loyalty to the American national identity and the sense of one’s family roots. So there were communities of Italian-Americans and Polish-Americans and Irish-Americans (like Joe Biden) who never forgot where they came from even though anything that hinted at a lack of full-hearted commitment to America was a kind of blasphemy. But even that uneasy settlement is finished now. The contractual agreement that Americans were one people with one sense of purpose, has been smashed to pieces by wilful isiveness: identity politics which sees historic injustice as unforgivable and life choices as creating irreconcilable differences, have blown apart that fragile accord.The people who abandoned their inherited identities in order to take part in this extraordinary, brave project are now faced with the consequences of rootlessness. Without the resources that go with generations of life in a recognisable place they are lost. Maybe the great American experiment has finally failed.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: New mass grave containing 57 bodies found in BuchaSacramento shooting: At least six dead after attack in CaliforniaDisgraced ex-SNP minister Derek Mackay will give evidence over Nicola Sturgeon’s ferry scandalLiver cancer treatment that ‘bathes’ organ in chemotherapy is effective in 90pc of patients\u0026#39Two Russian soldiers dead and 28 in hospital\u0026#39 after eating poisoned pastries from Ukrainian villagersFarmers reject ‘reckless’ study which likens harm of red meat sector to tobacco and fossil fuelsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"conversion therapy law must not rushed","story":"If the child asserted they were trans could the parents, counsellor or therapist, find themselves hauled through the courts if they asked questions, or prompted reflection over the time? How would the line be drawn in law between what was and was not acceptable? What safeguards were there to be to prevent the overzealous application of the law?These issues have not seemed of primary importance to LGBT lobby groups, but they add great complexity to declaring children ‘transgender’ in law.  This is why questions started to be raised as to how the legislation could be written to avoid criminalisation of parents or clinicians who encouraged a child to explore what else might be going on, given the possible medical consequences. This would be less of a concern in a world in which the lead LGBT organisation, Stonewall, had not aggressively pushed ‘no debate’ and to simplify a complex issue, including calling on the UN to deprive the UK’s Equality and Human Rights Commission of international standing for raising concerns regarding the legislation. Vagueness in law leaves ordinary people vulnerable in this environment. Unfortunately, despite the Government’s decision to work on these elements further, any bill banning conversion therapy for sexual orientation is bound to see poorly drafted amendments to insert gender identity tabled within weeks of introduction. Lobby groups will whip up a social media storm, portraying anyone that votes against the amendment as transphobic and MPs will have to decide whether they have the courage to intervene or whether to hope that it will all be okay. Peers will then face the same gauntlet. More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: New mass grave containing 57 bodies found in BuchaSacramento shooting: At least six dead after attack in CaliforniaDisgraced ex-SNP minister Derek Mackay will give evidence over Nicola Sturgeon’s ferry scandalLiver cancer treatment that ‘bathes’ organ in chemotherapy is effective in 90pc of patients\u0026#39Two Russian soldiers dead and 28 in hospital\u0026#39 after eating poisoned pastries from Ukrainian villagersFarmers reject ‘reckless’ study which likens harm of red meat sector to tobacco and fossil fuelsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hollywood has become bastion hypocritical progressivism1","story":"I met a female banker last week and she described the persistently sexist behaviour of men in her industry –those who felt compelled to act in an aggressively condescending manner towards her. I asked why they’re like that. “The movies”, was her response, a lifetime spent watching films like The Wolf of Wall Street and The Big Short.It rang true, a reminder of how incredibly powerful Hollywood is. Whole generations behave in certain ways because of films they watched growing up. Women imbibe many of their ideas about romance and love from Hollywood movies, and some men do too, and these end up impacting their entire lives.Given its power over us, it is unsettling to watch contemporary Hollywood succumb to odiousness and toxicity. Its crimes are manifold.The call was part of Disney’s chilling-sounding Reimagine Tomorrow campaign, in which executives vowed that by the end of this year 50 per cent of characters should be from “under-represented” groups (whatever that means, given that some of the groups they include - like trans people – represent a very small percentage of the world’s population).The enforcement of the doctrine doesn’t stop there: those visiting the Disney theme parks – probably the closest to pure heaven I got as a child – will no longer be addressed as “ladies and gentleman” and “boys and girls” but rather as “dreamers and friends”. “Princesses” is out too, of course. God forbid a child be addressed as either one sex or the other it might trigger them.Most infamously, its live action 2020 version of Mulan was filmed in Xinjiang, the province in which Uigyhers are being systematically killed in what is widely thought to be genocide. Yet the credits thanked eight government bodies in Xinjiang, including the security bureau in Turpan, and the “Publicity Department” of CPC (Communist Party of China) Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee – the very people authorising some of the most egregious human rights abuses of the 21st century. Disney claimed it was not responsible for the credits, saying the decision was taken by local contractors. But it was hardly a good look.How can an industry as steeped in double standards as this make anything good, let alone great? In 2019, tree-hugging celebrities arrived by private jet and superyacht to attend a Google Camp focused on climate change. Hollywood ostracises those accused of racism, but in the film Mank it cast Gary Oldman, on record with an anti-Semitic rant in 2014 (he later apologised to offended Jewish people), as Herman Mankiewicz, the Jewish producer of Citizen Kane. And the anti-Semitic ranter in chief, Mel Gibson, is still merrily making films for giant studios.All this heavy-handed and hypocritical playing at identity politics at the cost of actual integrity is destroying Hollywood and setting the stage for worse and worse films coming downstream.In the wake of George Floyd’s death, the Academy, the outfit behind the Oscars, set out a bizarrely rigid set of rules, stipulating that minorities must win a higher percentage of Oscars, and that a certain number of behind-the-scenes production top jobs (director, cinematographer etc) must go to minorities. “Minorities” included LGBTQ people, disabled people, anyone from an ethnic minority and, weirdly, women. It seemingly has nothing to do with getting the best people and making the best films, and everything to do with the obsessive box-ticking that has become the contemptible hallmark of the identity politics age.Hollywood has always had its own ugly inner demons as well as showy outer morality. It introduced morality clauses in 1921, after Fatty Arbuckle was arrested on accusations of rape and murder, but rarely used them. It was racist. It was sexist, and these things appeared in its films.Yet its main business was still making great movies, and indulging wild and expensive bursts of creativity. It made the movies that shaped our whole perception of the world.I went to Dubai mid-March to investigate the newly confident Jewish community of the UAE, which has been emboldened by the seismic Abraham Accords of 2020 declaring normal relations with Israel. Although my reason for going was interesting, it was not a destination I boasted about to friends.In my circles – middle-class intellectuals, wannabe intellectuals and generally “cultured” folk – everyone scorns Dubai. It’s vulgar, it’s artificial, it lacks culture, history and what we consider beauty, and of course, it’s morally dubious, given that an Islamic sheikh decides what’s OK and what isn’t. Smooching in public can land you in prison homosexuality is illegal.As it turned out, I found it an interesting and valuable trip on two levels. One, the Jewish community was lively, interesting and happy. Two, it made me realise my friends and I are the odd ones out in scorning Dubai. The place may have dodgy morals and exude brashness, but it seems to delight the planeloads of people flooding in from all over. Families and people with lots of tattoos frolicked and drank by vast swimming pools in corporate-looking hotels – but seemed to be having a whale of a time, splashing their cash as they saw fit. On a “heritage” safari into the pristine desert, arranged for me by the Dubai Tourism Authority, I was annoyed at lots of waiting around, and horrified to be given Vimto to drink while watching a falconry display. I was the only one: everyone else was all smiles, laid back, enjoying themselves.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: New mass grave containing 57 bodies found in BuchaSacramento shooting: At least six dead after attack in CaliforniaDisgraced ex-SNP minister Derek Mackay will give evidence over Nicola Sturgeon’s ferry scandalLiver cancer treatment that ‘bathes’ organ in chemotherapy is effective in 90pc of patients\u0026#39Two Russian soldiers dead and 28 in hospital\u0026#39 after eating poisoned pastries from Ukrainian villagersFarmers reject ‘reckless’ study which likens harm of red meat sector to tobacco and fossil fuelsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"macron losing le pen now real possibility","story":"How do you solve a problem like Marine? This is the question troubling Emmanuel Macron nine days before the French vote in the first round of the presidential election. In the last fortnight opinion polls have shown that Macron’s stock is falling and Le Pen’s rising.Such a scenario was inconceivable at the start of the year. The name on everyone’s lips then was Eric Zemmour, the right-wing polemicist, who announced his candidature with a promise to go after Islam and immigration. But Zemmour has peaked, his manifesto too narrow and too nasty, appealing in the main to right wing middle-class Catholics. Le Pen, on the other hand, is popular among the young and the working class, particularly blue-collar workers who in an earlier age would have voted for the left what we in Britain would call Red Wall voters. Economically, Le Pen has always leaned to the left, and in recent years she’s softened her stance on many social issues.In a debate last year with Macron’s Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin, she was mocked for being ‘soft’ on Islam. Unlike Zemmour – and it would seem Darmanin – Le Pen has no grudge with Islam, only with Islamic extremists. And herein lies the problem for president Macron: how can he describe Le Pen’s National Rally party as extreme right when his own Interior Minister ridiculed her on live television for being soft on Islam? The fact is that Macron has at times during his presidency acted in such a heavy-handed and authoritarian way that great swathes of the public won’t fall for his alarmist rhetoric about the advance of the “far right”. This, after all, is a president whose police force inflicted scores of terrible injuries on demonstrators during the Yellow Vest protests of 201819, injuries that were condemned by the UN, the European Parliament and human rights organisations. This is a president who subjected his country to probably the most stringent lockdown measures of any western nation, and then sneered that his objective in introducing a Covid Passport was to “piss off” the unvaccinated or those unwilling to have a third jab.During a television debate on Thursday evening Le Pen referenced the Covid Passport, expressing her disapproval of the draconian measure and portraying herself as the champion of the nation’s liberté. Le Pen looked confident as she fielded questions from journalists and members of the public. She believes the force is with her.Inflation, crime and energy prices are all on the rise in France, and so are the number of Covid cases. It was only a month ago that Macron told his people he had won his war on the virus and consequently masks and Covid Passports were no longer necessary. He dare not reimpose either before the election because he knows what his political adversaries would say: voila, yet more proof that this is a president who fails on all fronts.Instead Macron’s strategy in the final week of campaigning is negativity, to resort to the tried and trusted, to go on the attack against the “extreme right”. In the past it’s worked, but it is unlikely to work this time in the event of a second round head to head between Macron and Le Pen. Macron is loathed by millions on the left and they will not heed his call to lend him their vote to keep out Le Pen.Just as Britain’s Red Wall collapsed in 2019, in 2022 it could be the turn of France’s Republican Front to disintegrate and when the dust settles France could have its first female president.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: New mass grave containing 57 bodies found in BuchaSacramento shooting: At least six dead after attack in CaliforniaDisgraced ex-SNP minister Derek Mackay will give evidence over Nicola Sturgeon’s ferry scandalLiver cancer treatment that ‘bathes’ organ in chemotherapy is effective in 90pc of patients\u0026#39Two Russian soldiers dead and 28 in hospital\u0026#39 after eating poisoned pastries from Ukrainian villagersFarmers reject ‘reckless’ study which likens harm of red meat sector to tobacco and fossil fuelsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather temperatures plummet 6c britain braces wintry weather","story":"The UK is braced for further wintry weather over the weekend, with frost creeping in overnight and temperatures set to plummet as low as -6C in some areas.Forecasters said the peaks and troughs of spring will hit most of the country over the next week, with sunny spells and windy intervals expected in most regions.Gardeners have been warned to keep an eye on their blooms as sub-zero temperatures expected on Saturday night could disrupt flowering.Simon Partridge, the Met Office meteorologist, said lows of -6C were likely in northern regions on Saturday night, before a slightly milder turn on Sunday.Tonight will be cold, with widespread frost across the UK.

A small group of men trooped solemnly across a leafy cemetery in central Moscow. The priest in flowing black robes was Archimandrite (Abbot) Tikhon Shevkunov of the Sretensky Monastery. Obligingly, he held a black umbrella over his honoured guest, President Vladimir Putin.Much of the graveyard was filled with victims of the Soviet secret police, the Cheka, but it was not they he had come to see. The president was there to pay his respects to a philosopher called Ivan Ilyin, whose body had on his orders been dug up in Switzerland four years before and flown 1,400 miles to be reinterred in Moscow. He laid a bouquet of red roses before the black granite headstone and stood with Tikhon a short time, regarding the grave. Then he left.This week, across Russia, devastated families also gathered to honour the dead. They were burying young men killed fighting for Moscow in Ukraine. At one funeral witnessed by The Moscow Times, the priest spoke of the deceased, a lad in his 20s: “He fought against evil, Satanic spirits: Ukrainian Nazis, created by American multinational corporations.”The young man in the coffin was separated by 80 years from the remains of Ilyin in that Moscow cemetery, but according to the Kremlin’s increasingly strident ideological creed, the dead shared one important feature: they were part of the same God-given mission to gather up the scattered lands of mother Russia and rebuild its Christian empire.Putin doesn’t strike most of us as the pious type. He wears a £10,500 coat, reportedly owns a £500 million superyacht and is known the world over for vaguely homoerotic, topless photoshoots. He is brutal to the point of being labelled a madman or a psychopath. He spent the first 16 years of his career fulfilling a childhood ambition to work for the KGB, the secret police of a regime that persecuted Christians and preached atheism. And he is, in the words of various Western leaders and scholars, a “war criminal”.Yet somehow, this billionaire Soviet gangster has become a leader beloved by the Russian Orthodox Church, held up as an ideal by a messianic, neo-fascist movement called Eurasianism and presented by his propaganda machine as the man who will establish the Third Rome of Christendom in Russia.Western analysis, trapped in its own worldview, has tended to focus on arguments about Nato, the EU, resources or spheres of influence in the search for Putin’s rationale. But this misses that the war in Ukraine is a conflict with an overwhelmingly religious and cultural dimension, in which the Ukrainian government is cast as a malignant tool of Satanic and degenerate Western forces. The Russian takeover of this land was to be the start of a great revival of the ancient Russian civilisation, welcomed by its virtuous Slavic inhabitants, and signal a precipitous decline for the decadent, doomed West.Somehow, while most of the West wasn’t paying attention, Russia’s nostalgia for Soviet greatness merged into a longing for the imperial father-king, the tsar, and Putin duly transformed himself from a ruthless but boring state functionary into a modern approximation of the old autocrat: an infallible messenger of God in Aviators. But how did this happen, how did it help to justify a bloody invasion of Ukraine and what will happen now that the venture has stalled and Russia is teetering on the cusp of bankruptcy?Growing up poor in a dingy Leningrad tower block, Putin spent his youth chasing rats around the stairwell and dreaming of a future as a KGB strongman. He joined the secret police straight out of university, but it was not exactly a 007 existence. His first posting was in Dresden, a relative backwater in Soviet East Germany.Accounts differ as to what exactly he was doing there – grooming agents to smuggle Western technology, fostering the growth of anti-Western terrorists or more humdrum work. Whatever Putin was up to, it gave him a front row seat on the collapse of the Soviet Union. After witnessing the crumpling of East Germany’s Soviet government, he returned to St Petersburg (then Leningrad) to see the Soviet motherland succumb to the same disease.When and how he left the KGB has never been entirely clear, but Putin quickly made himself indispensable to a wide array of politicians and officials. He moved from a job working for Anatoly Sobchak, the St Petersburg deputy mayor seen at the time as a pro-democracy liberal, to a role at the Kremlin, where he won President Boris Yeltsin’s favour through mastery of his brief and zealous loyalty.But when Yeltsin passed on the reins in 2000, he handed over a country that had just been through a calamitous economic depression, during which its economy halved in size, inflation took off, the ruble was devalued and the state went bankrupt. This was to be the experience that many Russians now associate with their brief period of “democracy”.Still, Putin quickly disappointed his authoritarian fans by adopting a firmly pro-Western stance, in particular supporting the US invasion of Afghanistan after 911. Russia’s economy, buoyed by a rising oil price, recovered, and US president George W Bush declared that he had peered into Putin’s “soul” and seen a good man.Even back then, Father Tikhon was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill Orthodox priest. Rumoured to be the man who brought Putin to Christianity and hears his confessions, he was also a rising star of a new generation of conservative imperialists in the Church, who openly advocate a return to Russia’s monarchist days. “He’s a very conservative cleric with an imperial mindset,” says Lukin.One way of forgetting is to reach back beyond the Soviet era to a much older period of history. In that vein, in 2008 Father Tikhon released a documentary on the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, called The Lesson of Byzantium. The film purports to be a straightforward history of the empire, although in interviews Tikhon admitted that it is also “propaganda” aimed at giving Russians a place in history and a spiritual mission.The 70-minute film argues that Byzantium collapsed primarily because it failed to stay true to the Orthodox faith and abandoned a highly centralised model of imperial control that stamped out nationalist separatism. Instead it succumbed to the oligarchy, Italian finance and corrupting Western notions about the primacy of the inidual over the collective.Still, the empire did pass on an invaluable treasure to the Russian people: their Orthodox Christianity. “It was upon this treasure our forebears founded not banks… or pawnshops,” Tikhon preaches. “They founded Rus, the spiritual successor of Byzantium.” The “forebear” to whom he refers is, in fact, Prince Volodymyr (or Vladimir) of Kiev, a Viking ruler of a region encompassing much of modern Ukraine, who was baptised by Byzantine priests in the 10th century. Ukraine, in this reading, is simply relabelled as ancient Russia.Despite its obscure subject, Tikhon’s film was a runaway success, reportedly sparking more than 500 articles, many hours of radio and TV coverage as well as conferences and speeches. Fans of the film declared that Moscow must rediscover an ancient tsarist tradition of seeing itself as the Third Rome of Christendom.By 2013, the year before his invasion of Crimea, Putin himself took part in a state-produced follow-up film called The Second Christianisation of Rus, which positioned Russia’s post-Soviet surge of interest in Christianity as a second iteration of Volodymyr’s original conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy. The next year, in the midst of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, state TV aired a reading of an essay by Fyodor Dostoevsky chastising Slavic tribes who were ungrateful to mother Russia. In addition to being a brilliant novelist, Dostoevsky was also a committed monarchist who believed that Russia would one day reconquer the Byzantine capital Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul).In truth, according to Peter Eltsov, a professor of security studies at the US National Defence University, this obsession with Byzantium was hardly an ancient tradition: “It’s a 19th century invention.” The idea of Russia’s spiritual Byzantine roots took off in this period as an explicit bulwark against the break-up of empire, just as the notion of national identity was taking hold in Europe. As the anti-Western, monarchist philosopher Konstantin Leontiev argued: “Whether we like this Byzantine foundation or not, whether it is good or bad, it is the only secure anchor not only of Russian but of all-Slavic preservation.”In both Putin’s 2021 essay and 2022 presidential address on the invasion of Ukraine, there are clear echoes of the same strategy, appealing to an ancient religious bond between the peoples of Russia and Ukraine as a justification for war: “Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space,” Putin wrote in 2021. “Since time immemorial, the people living in the south west of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians.”The Eastern Orthodox Church, in other words, is a way to stitch the Russian Empire together.The heritage of Byzantium Rus was not the only idea to emerge in the dying days of the tsarist era with the aim of countering the appeal of the Western nation-state. Alongside a soup of conservative, religious and exceptionalist ideas of Russia, a new breed of Russian fascism was being developed. And that is where we return to our disinterred friend, Ivan Ilyin.Ilyin was a conservative philosopher exiled from communist Russia for his opposition to the Bolsheviks. He washed up in Berlin just as the new ideology of fascism was taking off in Italy and Germany. Ilyin saw in Mussolini and Hitler models for the reinvention of a new Russian tsarism, in which a strong leader could abolish the iniduality of his people and bind them into one spiritual, collective whole, free of corruption and impurities.Putin is clearly no philosopher, but of all the intellectuals in Russian history, it is Ilyin whom he quotes the most. According to the Yale historian Timothy Snyder, just as troops were being readied to invade Crimea in 2014, the Kremlin arranged for all of Russia’s senior officials and regional governors to be sent a copy of Ilyin’s Our Tasks, in which the philosopher predicts the emergence of a “national dictator” who will be “the living organ of Russia”.Today, the task of popularising this sort of messianic fascism falls to a movement called Eurasianism, propounded by a zealous supporter of Putin named Aleksandr Dugin, who appears with regularity on Russian TV screens. Russia must rediscover itself as a Eurasian civilisation, according to Dugin, which means that it must impose upon the continent a new political model that is collectivist, religious and autocratic. For this task, he maintains, conquest of the old Russian Empire is essential.Like Ilyin, Dugin casts this battle in apocalyptic and moral terms. He claims that it falls to Russia to save the world from Western degeneracy and nihilism, evidenced by phenomena like gay marriage and the transgender debate. In this, Dugin is at one with the Russian Orthodox Church.On March 6, 10 days after the invasion had begun, Patriarch Kirill gave a sermon calling the war “a metaphysical struggle”. It was essential for Russia to intervene, he said, to combat the “so-called values” offered by the West, in which “you have to have a Gay Pride parade” to be a member of the club.Putin, in his presidential address on the eve of the war, likewise blamed the West for trying “to destroy our traditional values” and replace them with “attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature”.But the hostility to Gay Pride is not just ideological. The opposition to anything seen to undermine the family, like feminism or homosexuality, is mixed up with a more worldly anxiety that Professor Eltsov believes is driving the war: demographic change.Like much of Europe, Russia is undergoing a significant demographic shift. Its Muslim population is having more babies than its Christian population and, by some projections, Russia could become a majority-Muslim country in the foreseeable future. By taking over Ukraine, using largely ethnic minority, non-Christian conscripts as cannon fodder, Eltsov says “the idea was to get a bunch – 40 million people – who are Slavs and Europeans”.In his 2008 film on Byzantium, Tikhon had explicitly linked the failure to have children and the rise of abortion to the empire’s spiritual decline and “demographic problem”. The obvious result, he noted, while showing footage of a modern Istanbul student smoking a cigarette, was that the city succumbed to Sulton Mehmed, a homosexual 21-year-old, who, in his telling, demanded the 14-year-old son of its governor as a lover immediately after his conquest.Aside from demography, the Church’s anxiety has been exacerbated further in recent years by a direct threat to its authority: a schism.In 2018, the chief patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Bartholomew I of Constantinople, decided to recognise a new, independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church. At a stroke, Ukrainian Christians were taken out from under Russian religious authority, changing an arrangement that had existed for centuries. Patriarch Kirill immediately cut all ties with Constantinople – the very seat of Byzantine Christianity from which Russia supposedly derives its entire spiritual heritage.In a letter written to fellow Orthodox churches in mid-March this year, Kirill blamed the West for the war and emphasised that “the peoples of Russia and Ukraine, who came from one Kievan baptismal font, are united by common faith, common saints and prayers, and share common historical fate”. Kirill and his fellow clerics believed that the Ukrainian government had deliberately engineered the schism, and began to push for measures to undo this calamity with increasing urgency.The Church was not the only authority feeling threatened by developments outside Russia. Putin himself moved further and further away from the liberal values he had talked about in the 1990s in response to a series of challenges. At first, he cracked down on Russia’s oligarch-owned media to avoid criticism of his mistakes, like his poor handling of the 2001 sinking of the Kursk submarine, in which 118 crewmen died, and the security services’ mismanagement of a 2002 terrorist siege in a Moscow theatre, which resulted in 170 people dying.After that, the Arab Spring and the colour revolutions spreading across Eastern Europe unsettled the aspiring dictator. Faced with the need to legitimise his rule and consolidate power, he turned to the Church and the useful hodgepodge of imperialist, autocratic ideas floating around Russian military and intellectual circles. It wasn’t long before his regime was televising footage of priests sprinkling holy water over missiles bound for Syria.Unfortunately, he appears to have spent too much time drinking his own Kool-Aid. He convinced himself that the story told about the ancient, spiritual union of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples was true. If Russia were bold enough to regather the land, the lost Russians of Kiev would soon come flocking back to the bosom of the motherland.Still, there is not yet a general sense in Russia that the war and its consequences threaten Putin’s grip on the country. Sergey Utkin, a scholar of international relations at the Russian Academy of Sciences, is one of the few Russian academics brave enough openly to state his opposition to the war. But he does not believe speaking out will change anything. Hostility to the West is too deeply embedded to dissipate and ordinary Russians will simply blame Nato for the impact of sanctions, he believes. “What’s happening is catastrophic for Russia. It’s not opposition to what’s happening, but the nature of what’s happening that will reveal it was a terrible idea,” he says.Nor are Western ideas likely to make inroads. Utkin used to call himself a liberal, but he has found “realist” models of international relations, like Samuel Huntingdon’s Clash of Civilisations, better predict the course of events. Similarly, Lukin says he is disillusioned by Western hypocrisy over Iraq and its mismanagement of Covid: “I used to be a pro-western guy but now I am very disappointed with the West… I’m thinking more and more about the China model as most suitable.”Over in the US, however, Eltsov, a native Russian who grew up in Leningrad, sees the war as a pivotal turning point not just for Putin, but for Russia as we know it. His 2019 book, The Long Telegram 2.0, argues that for all of the weird and wonderful dogmas promoted by the Kremlin, from Byzantium Rus to Eurasian fascism, at the base of it all is “absolute cynicism”. There is no truly unified Russian identity that could be held together by these ideas if the region weren’t ruled by a brutal autocrat, he argues, and sooner or later – sooner, given the impact of sanctions – he thinks Russia is likely to break up.The prospect is surely stomach-churning, I suggest, given that Moscow controls the world’s second-biggest arsenal of nukes in the world. But Eltsov points out that a similar problem was resolved after the break-up of the Soviet Union. “It’s solvable,” he says, “but it’s frightening.” The future, he believes, lies not with Putin’s new Holy Russian Empire, but with the fragmentation of Eurasia. “Russia is over,” he says. “It’s the beginning of the end.”More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: New mass grave containing 57 bodies found in BuchaSacramento shooting: At least six dead after attack in CaliforniaDisgraced ex-SNP minister Derek Mackay will give evidence over Nicola Sturgeon’s ferry scandalLiver cancer treatment that ‘bathes’ organ in chemotherapy is effective in 90pc of patients\u0026#39Two Russian soldiers dead and 28 in hospital\u0026#39 after eating poisoned pastries from Ukrainian villagersFarmers reject ‘reckless’ study which likens harm of red meat sector to tobacco and fossil fuelsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"would pass bbcs class test","story":"Here’s a question: what did your father (or, in some cases, your mother) do for a living when you were 14? Your answer could determine your chances of getting a job at the BBC, which has announced that by 2027, it wants a quarter of its staff to be from a working-class background – defined by the Social Mobility Commission as “the main parental earner” having a “low socio-economic or working-class occupation”.Besides the substance of the BBC\u0027s pledge, its real problem is one of definition. It is much easier to categorise a person’s race, sex or disability than it is their class. Would you call Sir Keir Starmer working-class? His father was a toolmaker, so by the BBC’s standards he would count. But he went to a grammar school, was classmates with future Tory peer Andrew Cooper, and was a QC and Director of Public Prosecutions before becoming an MP and Labour leader. I wouldn’t have made it to the BBC thanks to my father’s City job, but plenty of his colleagues, especially those who worked on what was still then an open outcry trading floor at the Stock Exchange, were East End and Essex boys from working-class roots.Class is our national obsession, with thousands of microsignifiers.  Names, accents, vocabulary, education, address, clothing, political affiliation… all these and more help us pigeonhole others, often without even being consciously aware that we are doing so. Do you shower before or after work? Do you have your dinner in the middle or at the end of the day? Do you say “lavatory‘toilet” or “loo”, “serviette” or “napkin”, “settee” or “sofa”?But the sands of these definitions are not immutable. Although the tripartite (upper, middle and lower class) ision of the famous 1966 Frost Report sketch is still conversational shorthand, it feels too simplistic now. A 2013 BBC survey identified no less than seven social classes: the elite, established middle class, technical middle class, new affluent workers, traditional working class, emergent service workers and precarious proletariat.Two generations ago, private education was something which solid middle-class families could afford: now they have been largely priced out. Signet rings have expanded from posh to middle- and working-class, too tattoos have gone the other way. Good luck finding a Conservative voter in a multi-million-pound Islington townhouse, but you will come across few fiercer Tories than in working-class Kent and Essex. For every class signifier, there is not just an exception, but an equal and opposite. The true sign of class, of course, is to treat everyone you meet just the same.When I was 14, my father was unemployed, so I guess we were part of the non-working class.He left school without qualifications and became an engineer, one of the Stakhanovite shock troops of BT (in work at 10am, home by 4pm). After privatisation, he got a company car, which was a mixed blessing. The vehicle had Cable and Wireless blazoned across both sides, making us look like a mobile billboard.Mum came from a family of bohemians who had refused to work on principle (she also left school early, to tour the Caribbean and Australia). She married my father, I think, because he looked exotically ordinary. They scrimped and saved until they could afford a nice house in West Kent, and I was the great hope for class mobility.Dad got the boot shortly after I joined the local grammar, and mum took several jobs to keep the mortgage going. My weekends were spent delivering leaflets and newspapers.My father had what I guess would be diagnosed nowadays as a nervous breakdown. He got another job within a couple of years but never recovered his self-confidence. Poverty is humiliating. The school organised a two-day activity celebrating the EU (this was John Major’s Britain). They demanded we all contribute ten quid and I didn’t want to ask my parents for it. So, when a teacher demanded payment, I told her I thought the EU was rubbish and I was withholding our money in protest. From little acorns, Brexit grew.We were not working-class, we were lower-middle-class, which the BBC wouldn’t begin to understand: people who are doing OK but are within one sacking or sickness of losing it all.As laughable as it may sound coming from a Daily  journalist living in north London, I still consider myself to be working class. I’m not any more, obviously, but it’s all about your roots, innit?I was brought up in a two-up, two-down in the North East. Dad was a fireman, my step-dad worked in a factory and my mother (or Mam as we say up our way) was a waitress. I went to a comprehensive school and was the first in my family to go to university.So technically, I’ve got all the badges needed to qualify for the BBC’s new recruitment policy.My children wouldn’t get a look-in though. They will have to fight it out with all the other middle-class kids in the ever shrinking pool of graduate schemes for non-quota jobs.Even in 2022, class remains the one characteristic that too often defines a person’s life chances in this country. Social mobility is stalling and the cost-of-living crisis is only going to make things worse.White working-class children persistently underachieve at school and the albatross of tuition fees means even fewer aspire to university. But what they lack in opportunity they often make up for in spark, determination and drive.Schemes like this are not only a good idea, they are vital if we are to tackle one of the most lingering inequalities left in modern Britain.So bravo BBC for lowering the ladder a little and recognising that true ersity is about more than just protected characteristics.Aged 14 I was smacked in the face by a girl in the PE changing room. She had called me posh. My retort: “How can I be posh if I have to go to school with people like you?” Mean, yes, but she had just set fire to another girl’s hair.Class, I learnt, is in the eye of the beholder.Whenever I asked Mum (the Leonard in my name) what class we were, she would say “professional working class”.At weekends my dad would don oily overalls and fix whatever was ailing the family car. The neighbours in our leafy Stockport suburb assumed he was a mechanic. Had that been the whole truth, then I would have met the BBC’s definition of working class.Dad (the Fox) was the son of a lorry driver, he left school in north London without any qualifications to become an apprentice toolmaker on the Caledonian Road.Yet he dreamt of something bigger. Night school, followed by the University of Manchester as a mature student, and he eventually became a chartered engineer.Mum’s cursus honorum reads: council house, grammar school, mature graduate, Civil Service and then teaching.I’m middle class today because grants meant my working-class parents could become graduates.But no one ever expects to find Boudicca Fox-Leonard with a distinct northern twang.Yes, I went to state school, but my home life was culturally rich, if not always financially. There were books and conversation, but no TV (or licence). It was an eccentric upbringing that defied class categorisation. And that, I’ve learnt, frustrates the type of people who work for the BBC.Let’s indulge the BBC’s tick-box exercise just this once. At 14 I was splitting my time between learning and caring for my single mother, a political refugee suffering the consequences of having been a journalist in a dictatorial country. I was on free school meals out of necessity. I lived in one of the poorest council wards in London – and still do. I knew boys who were stabbed to death.Our household income, excluding benefits, was approximately zero. Yes, I am working class.But telling this story is not how I got my job in the media. I got that by starting a political blog aged 16 which went viral, graduating twice before 22 and breaking stories as a freelancer. It is a testament to social mobility and equality of opportunity in this country that I was able to do all these things without the patronising discrimination of a quota scheme.Some ersity programmes are designed in good faith, but all ultimately negate a person’s innate abilities and leave a cloud marked “positive discrimination” over the heads of every professional from a working class background. Is that not the opposite of equality?If the problem is that BBC recruiters cannot be trusted not to judge on the basis of accent or skin colour, then the answer is to introduce more meritocracy, not less. Nameless CVs would be a good start.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: New mass grave containing 57 bodies found in BuchaSacramento shooting: At least six dead after attack in CaliforniaDisgraced ex-SNP minister Derek Mackay will give evidence over Nicola Sturgeon’s ferry scandalLiver cancer treatment that ‘bathes’ organ in chemotherapy is effective in 90pc of patients\u0026#39Two Russian soldiers dead and 28 in hospital\u0026#39 after eating poisoned pastries from Ukrainian villagersFarmers reject ‘reckless’ study which likens harm of red meat sector to tobacco and fossil fuelsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"4 holes 150 discount council","story":" holes in the £ discount off council tax - seeyoull fall through cracksMillions of households in bands A to D will get a one-off £ discount on their council tax from April under Rishi Sunaks plan to ease the impact of soaring energy billsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video martin-lewis-how-council-tax-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:XoqZAH,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Households on default tarfs who pay by direct debit will see an eye-watering £ annual rise to their bills, from £, to £,. There will be an even bigger jump for prepayment customers of £, from £, to £,. The Chancellor unveiled a package of help for families, including a £ council tax rebate in April and a £ energy bill discount in the autumn, which will be clawed back in instalments over  years from .But the measures were slammed at the time for being too stingy. MPs have raised alarm that people could miss out on council tax rebate or see payments delayed due to loopholes in the system.In a letter to Cabinet Minister Michael Gove this week, Levelling Up Committee chairman Clive Betts said: The Government needs to get a grip on the operation of the council tax rebate and give clear guidance to councils so that this rebate is delivered to households reliably and effectively.If the Chancellor is minded to bring forward additional support to households through the council tax system later in the year then it is even more crucial that every effort is made to create a process that works now. How does it work  People living in homes in council tax bands A to D in England will be eligible for the £ payment. It must be your sole or main home to qualy, so second homes and empty properties are not eligible.  Local authorities will deliver the rebate, with eligibility determined on your situation on April  .You can check which council tax band your home is in on the government website. Councils have also been given a £ million discretionary fund to use in areas of high deprivation or for people outside the eligibility criteria. . People need to be signed up to direct debit Payments will be made automatically to people who pay their council tax by direct debit, meaning local authorities already have their bank details. Councils have been told to contact people who do not pay their bills this way to make sure they donapost miss out. But fears have been raised that this could mean delays to payments for people not on direct debit schemes. Our Cost of Living team of experts are here to help YOU through a very dficult year.

The Levelling Up Committee has been pressing ministers for estimates of how many households are in this category. Figures sourced by the Local Democracy Reporting Service last month found that , households in County Durham and Northumberland did not pay council tax by direct debit. The overall figure is expected to be much higher. The Government has ordered local authorities to ensure people get their rebate by September   - months after it was initially supposed to be received. . People should have a current account Another concern is people who donapost have a current account, which has been estimated to be around ,.

It was not clear whether he planned to slash existing contracts that set the price in euros or dollars, but nations fear he may start to ration energy supplies.Germany and Austria moved a step closer to gas rationing on Wednesday, after activating an emergency plan.Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds hinted the UK should follow suit, before making a a complete U-turn.He first told the BBCaposs Sunday Morning show: We should be making those plans and the Government should be preparing, not necessarily in public, for that situation, and insisted the Government should stop shopping from one authoritarian regime to the next for fossil fuels. “But let’s be clear, we’re looking at the images coming out of Ukraine right now, I don’t think we should be talking about going back to business as usual where we just buy large quantities of fossil fuels, he said. Transport Secretary Grant shapps claimed rationing energy supplies is not the route the Government wants to go down on. He told Sunday Morning: I think the summit in Europe, the Germans in particular are very exposed to Russian energy.Mr Shapps added: [The UK is] not as open to shocks directly from Russia as a result of the fact that we donapost get as much oil and gas from them as other countries.Itaposs not the route that we want to go down.  Mr Reynolds, the Shadow Business Secretary, has since rowed back on his comments. Speaking to Times Radio, he said rationing oil and gas would be a disaster for households and businesses. The fact that you’re even asking the question is an indictment of Conservative energy policy over the past decade and the fact that we still haven’t had a plan from the government even though they said it was a priority and an emergency.” The UK has pledged to ban Russian oil imports by the end of this year as Putinaposs invasion of Ukraine has shown no signs of slowing down. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the transition would give the market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports - which make up % of UK demand. The Government did not make plans to reduce the UKaposs reliance on Russianaposs gas, claiming Russia only provides around % of the countryaposs gas supplies.Russia supplies around % of Germanyaposs gas. Despite the EU countries plans to prepare for rationing, it has admitted it will not be able to wean its reliance on Russia until mid-.

On Thursday all of us spent the day desperately reading gas and electric meters, photographing them from seven angles and spent two hours trying to send the numbers to a crashed website, while we screamed and family members muttered “take six deep breaths and try again” because the next day the price was going up by two million per cent. Thanks to this sense of fun from companies such as EDF and E.On, from now on we can play this jolly game every year. It can become like searching for Easter eggs, and we’ll all laugh about the time Grandma didn’t quite get her reading in on time, bless her, so she spent the next month living in the sideboard clutching guinea pigs inside her nightie to keep warm.  In a few years, it will be a festival, like Halloween. Each March  one person will dress up as the EDF man and ­children will scream “aaaaagh don’t take our heating away”. People will run from house to house looking into cupboards with a torch, then we’ll all eat raw pizzas that we cannot afford to cook to celebrate ­Meter-reading Day. This has happened becausewe don’t have an exact reading from the moment the price goes up, the energy companies can charge us for everything at a higher rate. They’ve been given a licence to do whatever they fancy. Next week it will be announced: “Due to rocketing fuel prices, energy companies can marry one person from every household” and it will be considered a great honour to hand your sister over to Scottish Power.  The Government gives advice on how to “shop around” for cheaper tarfs, as it’s our responsibility to see which of the big six suppliers are slightly less impossibly expensive than the others. It’s like the police saying: “There have been a lot of robberies in this area lately, so we’ve decided to crack down. We’ve set up an app, so you can contact all the muggers in the area and arrange which one you would like to hold you at knepoint and run off with your bank card.” Because it’s all down to you. This is why you’ll find Government websites that give advice such as: “Save money on boiling water by filling a pan, and taking it to your local crematorium to pop it on the furnace during a funeral, so you enjoy a well-earned brew.”  The only people who aren’t told by the Government how to reduce energy costs are the energy companies who set the costs. I suppose there’s no point in ordering them about as they’re completely helpless. Since  they’ve paid £billion to their shareholders, but there’s nothing they can do to stop that. Their prices and profits just keep shooting up until eventually they’ll own the universe, and creatures from other galaxies will wonder why they have a bill for £ from British Gas. So all we can do is huddle around a candle with a raw fish finger to celebrate.

And the money wasted on inadequate masks, gowns, goggles and gloves desperately needed by the struggling NHS would have paid for , new nurses. The junk, some of which is being burned, was bought through a government High Priority Lane for PPE buying set up by Boris Johnson at the start of the pandemic.It let Tory MPs and top civil servants recommend companies to supply PPE.  Michael Gove, shamed ex-Health Secretary Matt Hancock and former minister Esther McVey were the biggest names among  Tories who brought contracts in – but they are not accused of any wrongdoing. The true depth of the scandal emerged after Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner and Public Accounts Committee MP Dan Carden put a written question to DHSC minister Edward Argar.His Commons reply confirmed that £.bn of £.bn worth of PPE “which cannot be used” or “was not suitable for use in the health and social care sector” had been bought through the VIP lane. The lane was ruled unlawful by High Court judge Mrs Justice O’Farrell in January. Mr Carden said all suppliers of PPE ­products not fit for purpose should be made tothe money. He said. “Those responsible must be held to account and steps taken to recover losses.”  Ms Rayner added: “Unusable masks, gowns, goggles and gloves our frontline key workers desperately needed are now literally going up in flames, along with billions of taxpayers’ cash spent on it. “The next Labour government will establish an Office for Value for Money that would ensure taxpayers’ cash is treated with respect.” The DHSC claims around £m of PPE was not fit for use and a further £.bn was unsuitable for NHS staff. That means it could only be used in settings such as schools..

A new survey shows we are bottom of the European league when it comes to delivering the financial benefits of going plug-in. Danish motorists get the best deal with savings of more than £, within  months of choosing electric over petrol. The comparison site money calculated the average price of buying a new car plus the cost of , miles of travel in ten dferent countries in the first year. That showed Danes would spend £, on an EV plus travel costs compared to £, for a petrol driven car, a saving of more than %. A litre of unleaded in Denmark costs £.. A British motorist would shell out an average of £, on electric and £, on a traditional car, costing an extra .%.  Germans are £ worse off by going plug-in though the percentage dference is higher than the UK’s at .%. James Andrews of money said: “Denmark leads the way. You could buy and run two electric cars for a year for the same cost as a petrol VW Golf. “But in Britain chargepoint rollout is slow and EVs are also still more expensive than their petrol equivalents .” Denmark also offers EV drivers free parking up to £ a year and payment of road tax in installments.

Mr Andrews added: “Access to rapid chargers is still harder than finding a petrol station. You need to make sure you have public points available nearby before you commit to a purchase.” A Government grant for EVs has been cut from £, to £, and the £ toward the installation of a home charger was also scrapped.

Image: Getty ImagesByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |commentsA Tory minister today suggested poverty statistics released in the wake of Rishi Sunakaposs spring statement that did little to help struggling families, are somewhat misleading.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he didnapost want to get Brits lost in numbers but said poverty is ided into both absolute and relative. Poverty has been measured in absolute and relative terms to give official a full and accurate picture of how much families have to live on. This does not rule out the fact that around .million Brits will be pushed into absolute poverty, including , children, as the Chancellor refused to raise benefits - which will rise at less than half inflation. On top of this, campaigners have warned the Governmentaposs decision to cut Universal Credit by £ a week will push , children back into poverty.  Even before the pandemic, around  million children were living in poverty across the UK, the charity Action for Children has noted. The north east of England has seen the most dramatic rise in child poverty in the past five years, the charity says. Speaking on Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Mr Shapps said: I don’t want to sort of get us lost in numbers here, but poverty is ided into both absolute and relative , and sometimes the way it’s presented can be somewhat misleading to say the least.“I do not mean to in any way, shape or form underplay it because you don’t have to be an expert – you just look at the cost of living, as you mentioned, the increase in inflation… it’s very substantial. And that’s why the Chancellor’s already come forward with £ billion.” Imran Hussain, Director of Policy, Action for Children has said: Poverty destroys le chances. You cannot level up the country with millions of children in poverty so it’s vital the Government brings forward a credible plan to reduce poverty. Mr Sunakaposs £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will mostly benefit people in work. Even with a p cut in income tax from , seven out of eight workers will still be paying more tax overall by , the analysis from the Resolution Foundation think-tank found. Natalie from Hampshire, a single mum to two children told the Mirror she is worried about rising living costs and struggles to sleep at night. “As a single mum, money is tight. I don’t have a partner or anyone  to help and so the responsibility is completely on me. It can feel overwhelming and scary.” Some months are very hard and, to be honest, I don’t know how I will manage with £ less each month. The other day I turned on the kettle and could see my smart meter clocking the energy used so turned it off. Mr Shapps later admitted the Government might need to bolster support to help struggling families battle the cost-of-living crisis, as he said, “I don’t rule out the fact that we may need to do more.” Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “I feel angry at the scale of the crisis people in this country are facing and the lack of response from Government in the spring statement - and promises on announcements in the future just wonapost cut it. We have set out that windfall tax that would give households a huge amount of help, relative to what the Government are doing - up to £ for households who are most affected by energy prices.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyNational Insurance Company Ltd.Single mumpovertyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Next, Adele sprays furniture polish onto the wooden door before taking another cloth and polishing it until it shines. She then moves onto the radiator - for which she uses a little brush to get in between the ridges at the top.  Asshe hadnapost been thorough enough, Adele opens the window and cleans the inside of the frame - even going to theof sticking a cotton bud into the little holes to make sure everything is sparkling clean. Finally, she takes her toothbrush and a bottle of C and gets to work polishing the rest of the frame of the window, leaving no stone unturned.

One person said: I honestly have so much respect for anyone who spends their days like this I could never. Another said: God I wish I had the time to do this everyday. However, sadly many people took the opportunity to troll Adele for being part of the travelling community, and threw stereotypes at her.

Citizens Advice believes around five million people would be unable to pay their energy bills from April, even accounting for the support the Government has already announced.

The foundation’s senior economist Jonathan Marshall said: “Today’s energy price cap rise will see the number of households experiencing fuel stress double to five million.

Sam Barton, , has had Botox, veneers, fillers in his cheeks, lips, jaw and chin amid speculation he wanted to look like reality TV star Joey Essex.But he says he has now given up the treatments and his old party lestyle following the pandemic and is instead focusing on his business - which specialises in cosmetic work, reports Birmingham Live.Barton has also stepped away from social media and says some of his surgery was pointless in his quest for fame. I used to spend £, on a bottle of Champagne, he said. I was just interested in being pictured on a night out enjoying a lavish lestyle so I could post the pics on Instagram and other social media.I wanted fame and I said some stupid things in the past just to get in the papers. I had surgery on my face and other parts of my body, which cost me thousands of pounds . It was pointless and - although I may give myself a little bit of workI think I need it - I will never undergo needless surgery again. I have changed.When I was younger and partying every night, I wasnapost truly happy. I was constantly concerned about what I looked like. I was scrutinised on social media and it wasnapost having a good impact on my mental health. Donapost get me wrong. I still enjoy the occasional blow out - it is part of my personality. But the party lestyle doesnapost define who I am anymore. I was silly. I took advice on how I should behave with the media and told to say things which would get myself headlines. I wanted fame. I wanted to become a star but it was just so shallow.  I was never truly happy like I am now. I feel I am achieving great things through hard work. I often work six or seven days-a-week but it is paying off. I have just bought a house with the money I have made through my business. I am self-sufficient. Sam has used his experience of plastic surgery to set up his Sutton-based business, AMC Aesthetics. He said: It was due to open as we went into the first lockdown, which was a huge blow. I spent the lockdown giving online training and working really hard. The business has gone from strength-to-strength and we have had a turnover over £, since it opened. We are forecasting a turnover of £, next year. Although I will not spend any more money on surgery transforming my body, I still have a keen interest in cosmetic work and I like to pass on my knowledge in the field to other people. We are very responsible and will generally only treat people over . They need to be sure they want cosmetic treatment. I think young people can be influenced very easily by celebrities who have treatment. Everything we do is very responsible. He said travel would be a big part of his future - and had a message for a new generation of fame-hungry youngsters. I love travelling, he said. I enjoy my holidays in places like Dubai and Tenere and want to spend more time travelling.The wannabe celebrity lestyle is so shallow. You will be happier going out and getting a fulfilling job or setting up your own business rather than chasing fame. Real happiness lies deep within you, seeking the celebrity le the way I did is is very shallow. I no longer use social media like Instagram and Twitter in my personal le.

This is notorious fraudster John Darwin who plotted with his first we Anne to swindle nearly £, – including le insurance and pensions – by faking his death in the North Sea in a canoe in . Now,  years on from an outrageous con-trick that made headlines around the world, -year-old Darwin does a spot of shopping at a store called WILCON.The former teacher and prison officer may be hoping to cash in on his crime again as his story is turned into a major ITV drama about to hit our screens – and he is writing a tell-all book about his story.We caught up with the Canoe Man in the C Pacic heat of the Philippines – a far cry from chilly Seaton Carew in County Durham where he faked his demise.The crook refused to answer questions as he hopped into a £, SUV and sped away from the Wilcon store car park in Antipolo,  miles from capital Manila. Later his Mercy, Darwinaposs -year-old second we, told us: “The book’s about his le, but it’s not yet finished. You have to wait.” It will follow her husband’s autobiography The Canoe Man: Panama and Back, which he wrote while serving three-and-a-half years in jail before his  release. Mercy is angry the four-part ITV drama The Thief, His We and the Canoe, starring Eddie Marsan as Darwin, has been made without her husband’s permission.  In real le, Darwin and Anne carried out the fraud in . He was seen paddling out from Seaton Carew beach near Hartlepool. Then Anne reported him missing while he hid in a tent down the coast. He then moved to a bedsit next door to the family home, making a door behind a wardrobe into Anne’s bedroom and growing a bushy beard as a disguise for trips into town. The couple’s grieving two sons were never aware of what had really happened. Four years later the couple headed to Panama to start a new le with their ill-gotten gains.  But they were caught after he came home to get papers from police needed for a change in Panama’s immigration laws – and gave them his real name, saying he had amnesia. At first it was hailed a miracle that the missing canoeist had somehow survived. But his lies unravelled when the Mirror ran a story under the headline “Canoe’s this in Panama ” in December , with a snap of the pair in an estate agent’s office. Both he and Anne got just over six years for obtaining cash by deception. It emerged they had staged his disappearance as part of a pension, mortgage and insurance scam to avoid bankruptcy. They were ordered to repay £,.The couple had £, of assets – £, had been repaid by . Anne orced him after  years of marriage. Now almost , miles away from the scene of his crime, le appears far rosier for Darwin, who still receives a state pension. A friend said: “John and Mercy are really happy together. He feels like he’s been given a second chance at le and he’s grabbing it with both hands.” One associate of Mercy’s said: “I have always believed John to be a rich guy. He still seems in good health.” Darwin and Mercy, who has businesses including a clothes stall, are said to own three properties in the area. The couple are understood to have met online in .

And as so often with the Tories, they talk tough on crime, only to go weak on the causes of it. Just look at the mess they have made of the Met.

Tragically, they both died – Armani in February and Tom last week.  But during that last year of Amani’s le, it was Tom who brought her the joy of true friendship. And when she died, Tom suffered the loss of a true friend too. Amani’s family have the comfort of knowing what a dference Tom made to her final days. The disease that killed them both was an aggressive brain cancer known as glioblastoma multorme. Tumours like it kill more children and adults than any other cancer, yet only % of research money is allocated to finding a cure. The best legacy Amani and Tom could wish for is for the Government to agree to provide much more financial support.Darwin a loser We tracked down canoe fraudster John Darwin to the Philippines, where his we told us he will make nothing from a new TV drama about his extraordinary fraud. Darwin played dead for five years in a £, le insurance swindle after pretending to have perished in a canoe accident. He may think he is getting a raw deal by being denied money for his oar-deal.

In the midst of a cost of living crisis, with all-time-high inflation, national insurance tax hikes and rising interest rates, many have been fearful about the beginning of this new financial year. But the start of this month also saw the enormous rise in the price cap on energy bills set by regulator OFGEM, to a record £,. The soar in cost will mean the average household will see a rise of £ per year in their gas and electric bill.  So which of the two is cheaper to run  Most central heating models use gas radiators pumping hot warmer from a boiler to heat several rooms at once. Naturally, this can prove expensive as it uses gas over a wide area for several hours a day. The alternative is to heat only the room youaposre using or need to heat with an electric appliance that works independently. Electric heating units take their power from wall sockets rather than one central system, but this isnapost necessarily cheaper upfront.  While market chaos has made it near impossible to estimate accurate electricity and gas prices, tradespeople estimate the former is more expensive, The Express reports.Data reported by checkatrade from the last time prices were stable - in December  - show gas heating costs approximately .p per kWh.Electric heating is almost four times more expensive at p per kWh. But using electricity creates savings where, such as in installation. Gas central heating systems require the hand of a specially trained tradesperson and cost up to £, on average. Electric central heating systems cost markedly less, averaging out at £,.  Heaters not hardwired to the mains usually require a single plug socket, with no electrician necessary. But there are other factors to consider when considering whether to use electric heating. One such consideration is efficiency, as gas wonapost convert to heat at a : rate. Most research shows that, at peak efficiency, gas boilers are roughly  percent effective. Electric heaters generate one unit of heat per hour of operation.

The great-grandad woke up to find his window had been forced open and the £, he had painstakingly saved to spare his family the burden of his funeral costs was gone.The burglars had also taken the ­retired painter and decorator’s CCTV camera to cover their tracks. Heartbroken John told the Sunday People : “I just don’t want to be in this house any more. I don’t feel safe and this makes me angry. “I struggle to sleep at night worrying they will come back. I should not have to feel like that living in my own home. I will not be keeping money in the house any more. But I will never have that type of money again. “It took me a really long time to save and I felt at ease knowing I had that money there because it really would have helped my family when I am gone. “My family now have to help with everything.”  His granddaughter Chloe-Ann Preedy, , added: “He is very upset. This is an old, frail man and he’s been hugely affected by this. It has really hit him hard. “What they have done is absolutely disgusting. They are the lowest of the low. He is particularly upset as he hoped to save the money for his funeral and to help the family. “He is just old-fashioned like that. He is very selfless and is the most ­generous man.” John lives mostly in his living room ­because of his health conditions and his daughter, Jeanette Preedy, visits him up to five times a day in Milton Keynes, Bucks. After waking up and realising he had been robbed, the partially-sighted pensioner called the police, then Jeanette.  Chloe-Ann went on: “My mum hasn’t slept well since, being worried about him. All my mum and dad want to do is help my grandad. “Police think there was more than one person because the window – which grandad usually leaves slightly open to help with his breathing – was open completely and the back door was open. “When he went to sleep, everything was locked – so someone must have climbed in through the ­window and opened the back door for the other one or two. “They’ve then sneaked past my grandad, taken the money and left through the front door. On the way out, they snatched the CCTV camera and threw it on the ground outside. Police found it but the footage ­obviously isn’t there.” John, who is also hard of hearing, had been keeping the money in his wallet at home because he struggles to use the bank.  Chloe-Ann, who works as a carer, said: “He helps his neighbours a lot, so he likes to have cash at hand. “He gave a family nearby money when they were struggling to provide for their son. This is just how my granddad likes to be. He has the kindest soul and will go out of his way for everyone.” She added of John’s ordeal: “He is usually so strong but he is so upset now. “He actually doesn’t want to live there any more. He’s been there for at least  years and it’s been his haven – but he doesn’t feel safe now. “It is not a nice time at the moment. We as a ­family are not sleeping properly.” Thames Valley Police confirmed that officers ­had attended John’s address on March .They said the burglary was believed to have taken place some time between ­midnight and .am. A force spokesman ­added: “Investigations are ongoing.” John’s family have since started a crowdfunding appeal in a bid to ­replace his stolen cash.You can donate to the appeal here. Chloe-Ann said: “We are very ­grateful to those who have helped out so far.

He met so-called Canadian nurse “Esther Anderson” on a dating site and they enjoyed daily chats for  months. But the picture he was sent of “Esther” is a fake. And her cries for help and wild tales of being jailed for smuggling gold were total claptrap. Each time Esther asked for help, intelligent John transferred money from his account – even believing he would become the owner of two .kg gold bars worth £.million. John, , took out loans to give Esther £,., plus a further £, borrowed from his father. He was sent receipts for the gold. But it was entirely fictional.  John – who has an IQ of over  and a masters degree in engineering and robotics – fell for the crooks’ story after meeting Esther on dating website match. As the romance intensied over text messages and FaceTime, Esther told John she would move to Lincoln to be with him. She then asked him for £ a month for food and claimed she was desperate. John obliged and even went hungry himself to afford the gts. He tells the Sunday Mirror: “I always help people around me. I felt bad and I sent the money. “She said ‘Thank you my love and I can’t wait to come and meet you’ and things like that. “How would anyone feel when he hears affectionate words ” He was sucked in by pictures showing a smiling “Esther”.  The con took a twist when Esther said she was a volunteer and was heading to Africa to help build a children’s hospital. She would also visit her mother in Ghana before flying to see John in the UK. Just days later Esther claimed to have been jailed in Ghana for concealing the gold bars in a case. She asked John to pay a court fee to free her from jail. Then he received letters and documentation asking him to pay for the gold to be released. Esther saidhe paid officials she would give him the gold, or sell it and pay him back. But the amount demanded kept increasing. And John kept paying out to ensure the gold was released and he could get his money back. “I was expecting to get the money back when the gold was sold,” he says. “It turns out everything was a scam.” John took out four loans to release the gold and transfer it into his name. He says: “I only sent large sums of money to solicitors and police.  “I was dealing with supposedly official people. “They sent police badges and passports and everything. Esther never asked me for large amounts of money, just daily amounts for food.” He was sent a certicate from Straw P. Beachland Gold Mines Limited, which read: “This is to certy that John Rousakis, next of king [correct] Esther Anderson, is the holder of two bars of gold weighing .kg each.” A receipt in February  acknowledged £, had been paid. Another, in August that year, was for £,. With the sum borrowed by John’s father, the family ended up in £, debt. They saw nothing inand, in February , Esther disappeared. John says: “They kept it going for a year. We were talking daily. At one point I had handed over the money for the gold. They made a bank account for me. Everything was so well planned.” John came to the UK from Greece in  – three years after suffering catastrophic injuries in a car accident. He says the scam has wrecked his mental health, admitting: “I’m used to being used.” John has been awarded £, after Barclays admitted partial liability. The bank did not pay the full amount because it said the initial outgoing sums were small and did not raise concerns. It was only when a large amount was sent that Barclays admitted it had failed in its duty of care to warn John he could be victim of a scam. The money was sent to a non-UK account, making it impossible to access by Barclays. A bank spokesperson said: “This is a tragic case of a romance scam and we have every sympathy for our customer.  “The complaint has been thoroughly investigated, following which our customer chose to refer the case to the Financial Ombudsman Service and we await the conclusion of their review. “A scammer will use a iety of scenarios to target your emotions and get you to part with your money, often using a family emergency or an overseas crisis as a reason. “We encourage customers to always be vigilant and ensure they’ve taken the right steps to determine the person they are speaking to is who they say they are.” Chloe Roche, fraud team leader at CEL Solicitors, which handled John’s case, said: “The first international payment was unusual for the account. “ Barclays admitted they should have intervened. Don’t be ashamed. It happens to a lot of people. These scammers are sophisticated.

Danny McCubbin, , bought the house in Mussomeli, Sicily, where a aposCase  Euroapos campaign was launched to encourage foreigners to the area. The Aussie, who had been living in the UK for  years, decided the opportunity to own an overseas home at a cut down price was too good to turn down and urged others to do the same. However, the condition was that buyers had to renovate the house within three years of purchase to have complete ownership. And with labour shortages in Italy’s construction industry made the request tricky to fulfil as the chef – who has worked for Jamie Oliver’s Fteen Foundation – couldn’t find anyone to help him renovate his dream home within the time frame. He was forced to sell the property back to an estate agency after just a few months, receiving his payment back, as it was extremely dficult to find builders.Speaking to iNews, he said: “It was very dficult to find a builder and over time the house deteriorated.“By the time I did find a building company, it was double the cost to renovate it. I decided it was not worth it for me anymore.” Danny said he was disappointed, having enjoyed the quiet le in Mussomeli, a town of just , people.  However, it did not deter him as he managed to turn his hand to buying another cheap house for £,which required less work. In addition, he was able to find two construction workers to do a week of work for him, with the smaller fixes setting him back £, . This has now allowed him to settle into the home and he has now opened a community kitchen to make and deliver free meals to vulnerable families.He added: I moved here at the end of December , because I wanted to live in Italy when Brexit happened.“I’ve always wanted to live in Sicily, my parents loved the countryside. So I asked myself what was missing in Mussomeli and I came up with the idea of The Good Kitchen.”  And the labour shortage has promoted Mussomeli’s deputy to try and reduce the pressure on homeowners who are in desperate need of builders to help renovate their houses. And mayor Toti Nigrelli has since promised to alleviate the labour shortage for others hoping to purchase a cheap house at a reduced rate.  He said: “Local enterprises, which are busy with renovations until , are forced to turn down new contracts, but soon there will be an influx of new builders from abroad to help out.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Housing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Households are facing eye-watering rises on energy bills from today as the maximum amount firms can charge people on default tarfs is rising by an average of £. Many Brits who pay for energy by regular direct debit payments may be thinking about ending this to give them more control over their outgoings by switching to quarterly bills. They may also have been concerned by news that some energy firms are hiking direct debit payments.But in aMoneySavingExpert video, Lewis said: I know that many people are thinking of ditching direct debits at the moment, because they want to control what theyaposre going to pay by having a bill that comes in and then paying it on the back end rather than dealing with estimates of usage. I gave evidence the other day to Parliament saying I do believe some energy companies are articially inflating direct debits, by far more than the % increase in the price cap to aid their cash flow and that needs to be cracked down on. The price cap, set by regulator Ofgem, limits how much the average home will pay for a iable rate energy deal when using direct debits. This cap rose today by % on average, or £ a year. Lewis added: Butyouaposre thinking of ditching your direct debit, I do need to make you aware of something. While you may gain control, it will cost you more. Someone paying by monthly direct debit for average energy use would have a price cap of £, a year from today.  If you were to ditch direct debits and swap to quarterly bills, that cap goes up to £, a year. So that means youaposre paying over % more for the same usage than you do by direct debit, because there is a discount allowed for direct debit, Lewis said. I canapost tell you what to do, butyou can cope with the direct debit, it is cheaper to do so.

Pampered Putin cronies in Surrey’s St George’s Estate – an exclusive gated enclave where a third of residents are Russian – are unable to pay for private jet flights, holidays or even taxis now their credit cards are frozen. Many have been forced to ask staff to fork out for cabs after finding Uber executive accounts linked to their cards had been closed.A personal assistant to several oligarchs on the estate told us yesterday: “I have had to endure hearing them in tears because they can’t get on board a private jet or book a holiday or even get an Uber any more. But it’s hard to have any sympathy. It doesn’t matter to thempeople are dying in Ukraine.” The whistleblower said one super-rich Russian we collapsed in tears after bespoke electrical fittings ordered for her £ million St George’s estate mansion were blocked.

Oligarchs in the heavily guarded -acre enclave near Weybridge, Surrey, include oil tycoon and close Putin pal Oleg Deripaska, , a mining and energy company boss. Properties on the estate sell for more than £ million. The whistleblower, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, told us: “These people care nothing for the suffering in Ukraine.  “They care only about themselves and how the sanctions are starting to affect their champagne lestyle. “Just before the war one of the wealthy Russian families I know in Surrey paid £, to fly a live crab and some black caviar from Moscow on a private jet for a party. “But that’s all changing now and it’s good to see them having to adjust to their new place in the world.“I laugh at their bleating. I get five calls a day from Russian billionaires asking me to help them with blocked credit card problems. “They askthey can use my address when they apply for new cards to avoid the sanctions. I just put the phone down. I can’t talk to these people any more – they should understand what is happening and what their leader is doing.”Foreign Secretary Liz Truss plans to sanction even more oligarchs.

A spokesperson for Knowsley Council said: We dispute the version of Huyton Village presented here. We are doing all that we can to ensure our town centres are thriving.That’s why we developed our ten year plan for Huyton Village Centre which will transform the area in terms of the retail and leisure offer, facilities and public spaces. The development of Huyton Village Centre remains a key priority for the Council.Despite the pandemic, over the last two years eight new restaurants have opened in Huyton village driving a thriving nighttime economy. We acknowledge there have been some isolated incidents of anti-social behaviour but are working with our partners to identy and prosecute those responsible sending a clear message that behaviour of that kind will not be tolerated. Such transformation can’t happen overnight, but we have made signicant progress in attracting new businesses, creating more jobs and these plans will continue to progress.

Angela Boote, , aposlied repeatedlyapos as she desperately tried to cover up her crimes and avoid being brought to justice. But the net closed on the brazen criminal, who was described as a trusted and well-liked employee and had worked for her company since , the Liverpool Echo reports.She has been jailed for three years and four months after stealing a total of £, through her role at Liverpool insurance brokers Grfiths and Armour. Over the course of a number of years the mum redirected cash intended for clients to bank accounts linked to herself and her family members.  Liverpool Crown Court heard earlier this week how Boote spent the cash to fund a “lavish lestyle” of expensive holidays, clothes and jewellery. Photos on her social media accounts, which are no longer public, show herself, her husband and their daughters in far flung destinations like Aruba in the Caribbean during the three year period she was stealing money.Sarah Grfin, prosecuting, also detailed to the court how Boote took extensive steps to cover her tracks - and continued to try to con her colleagues when they started to uncover her deceit. Suspicions were first raised in September  when Boote was away on holiday. A client complained to the company that a £ refund that they were due to receive had not entered their account.  Boote’s manager began to investigate the complaint, finding the bank details on the payment did not match those provided by the client. She contacted HSBC, the bank through which the transfer was conducted, to find out who the account belonged to and copied Boote into the email. At this point, Boote ed from leave and contacted HSBC numerous times herself, saying the issue had been resolved. At every turn, she tried to cut her manager out of the exchange, not copying her in to the emails. At one point, she even replied to HSBC and tried to make it look like her manager was copied in - but with her email address spelled incorrectly. Boote’s manager continued to question what had happened to the money and Boote finally admitted that she had sent into her daughter’s account. Yet even then Boote continued to lie, using the explanation that she must have incorrectly entered her daughter’s details because they were written down on a piece of paper next to her and she had planned to send her money from her personal account. At this stage, Boote’s manager reported the issue as a major error and an investigation of Boote’s accounts began. Eventually,  fraudulent payments were discovered and Boote was sacked shortly after. Recorder David Knton QC said Boote’s criminality was characterised from the start by complex attempts to cover up her dishonesty, with  paper trails created to hide her tracks. The court heard Boote had paid back around £, from inheritance received from an aunt and was being pursued for more cash through civil courts. Lionel Greig, defending, said Boote knew she had let herself and her family down and deeply regretted her actions. She will serve  months of her sentence in prison before being eligible for release under licence.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereDr Stankovic also revealed that these symptoms can also appear in those fully-vaccinated. Speaking to the Times Now News Portal, Dr Stankovic said: “Pain is often associated with ringing in the ears. Surprisingly, these symptoms, although more rarely, can also appear in patients who have been vaccinated with a full course. She also advised those with hearing loss, ringing in your ears and dizziness to not dismiss these symptoms and still take a test. Brits can no longer have testing kits for free after the scheme was stopped, with those looking to test having to buy from local pharmacies or online. Covid infection levels have hit a record high across the UK as free Covid- testing for millions in England comes to an end.Some . million people in the UK are estimated to have had Covid- in the week ending March , up from . million in the previous week, the Office for National Statistics said.The ONS data shows one in  people in England are estimated to have had Covid during that week, up from one in  the week before, and in Wales the figure is one in  people, up from one in .Both are record highs and it comes after experts warned that at such levels anyone in the population who can catch Covid is likely to get it.

The UK Health Security Agency monitors outbreaks of the nasty sickness bug, which bring highly unpleasant symptoms. Norovirus is highly contagious and causes vomiting and diarrhoea, but normally does not last much more than a couple of days. An expert has warned hand sanitiser is not enough to stop its spread. Lesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety, UK Health Security Agency said: As pandemic restrictions were lted and now people have begun to mix more, norovirus outbreaks have started to increase.  Symptoms include sudden onset of nausea, projectile vomiting and diarrhoea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs. Stay at homeyou are experiencing norovirus symptoms and do notto work or send children to school or nursery until  hours after symptoms have cleared. If you catch this bug, it is important to drink water to avoid dehydration and do not to visit elderly relatives, especially in care homes or hospital while unwell.Hand washing is key to help stop the spread of this bug, but unlike for Covid- alcohol hand sanitisers do not kill off norovirus, so soap and warm water is best.” Often norovirus outbreaks affect care homes and schools the most, with inhabitants of both spreading the virus to their families, once within the home it can spread into the wider community.The six main symptoms Vomiting Watery diarrhoea Feeling sick Aching arms and legs A high temperature A headache How to reduce the spread of norovirus:Stay at homeyou are experiencing norovirus symptoms, the UK Health Security Agency say. Do notto work or send children to school until  hours after symptoms have cleared. Also avoid visiting elderly or poorly relatives, particularlythey are in hospital or a care home. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and warm water. Alcohol hand gels don’t kill norovirus. When an infected person vomits, the droplets contaminate the surrounding surfaces. A bleach-based household cleaner or a combination of bleach and hot water should be used to disinfect potentially contaminated household surfaces and commonly used objects such as toilets, taps, telephones, door handles and kitchen surfaces. If you are ill, avoid cooking and helping prepare meals for others until  hours after symptoms have stopped, as norovirus can be spread through food contaminated by the virus when food is handled by symptomatic people infected iniduals. Wash any contaminated clothing or bedding using detergent and at °C, andpossible, wear disposable gloves to handle contaminated items.What to doyou have norovirus  You are required to isolate by yourself at home until  hours have passed since the last time you were sick, doctors say.The NHS warned: “Stay off school or work until you have not been sick or had diarrhoea for at least  days. This is when youaposre most infectious. Do not visit hospitals or care homes during this time.”The virus can survive outside the body for several days on contaminated food and so it is important for people to wash their hands regularly, especially before eating. People are most infectious from when symptoms start until  hours after all symptoms have passed. You may also be infectious for a short time before and after this.

It makes me feel horrible. We try and find the cheapest food.\"Donna Skeffington, , has admitted she cant even afford Easter eggs due to the rise in cost of living Image: Paige OldfieldByPaige Oldfield:,  Apr |comments A grandma in one of the poorest streets in Salford has confessed she canapost even afford Easter eggs for her grandchildren - and has to borrow off her son just to help pay the bills.Donna Skeffington, , has resorted to trying to find the cheapest food in order to save money as her elderly partner needs the heating on.But due to the rising fuel costs, she has to use blankets instead of putting the heating on, Manchester Evening News reports.The grandmother of four is from Ordsall in Salford, which is the third most deprived in Greater Manchester and th most deprived local authority area in England, according to the most recent data for Indices of Multiple Deprivation.  She said: “My partner is  and he doesn’t like being cold – we have to put the heating on. We throw blankets on but he doesn’t like that,” she says. Sometimes we have to borrow off our son, he never asks for it back. “My partner has worked all his le and he has to pay for me out of his state pension for bills, for everything. It makes me feel horrible. “We’ve just got to try and cope with it. We try and find the cheapest food. We are okay for now but things could go bad very quickly. “You’ve just got to deal with it. You can’t do anything about it you can’t starve and you’ve got to have the heating on. “We’ve had to cut back on everything,” the -year-old says as she shelters from the rain. “We can’t afford to go out, we can’t afford anything. “We have kids having to go to food banks in this day and age. It’s making me feel depressed. I’ve got four grandchildren – I can’t even afford to buy them an Easter egg.” Melissa Speed, from Salford, recently had her PIPbenefit stopped. She now receives £ which has to last her a fortnight. “I’m not coping at all,” the -year-old said. “I have to go round getting food parcels. “By the time I’ve done gas and electric and bought food, I have nothing. I’m going round picking up dimps because I can’t afford my own tobacco. We go to a charity to get breakfast and dinner.” Andrew Blenkhorn, from Swinton, plans to buy his granddaughter a present from Poundland. “I’m struggling with the gas and electric, it’s gone up,” the -year-old says. “It’s this time of year, isn’t it, that all the utility bills, council tax, food and everything  is rising. “Just for arguments sake, I do a shop online. There was something the other week that was a pound, but then it had gone up to £..  “You’re having to shop around to find the cheapest food. I live on my own and can cook so I make enough meals and freeze them to save money. My bills are going up even though I’m in credit. “I feel sorry for my daughter. She’s a community health visitor and a single mum, but she has childcare costs and everything . “The prices of everything are going up. I get PIP allowance but I’m just on the cusp of going into my overdraft every money, and that’s just on basics like food and bills. It does get me down. I’ve noticed that even things on Amazon have gone up.” Salford and Eccles MP, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has called for the city’s status to be upgraded ‘urgently’. She says much of Salford is in ‘desperate need’ of regeneration. Worsley and Eccles South MP Barbara Keeley described the ‘lack of central support’ from the government for a city where constituents are having to choose between heating or eating as ‘appalling’. But the government says the system used to calculate the Index is ‘fair, robust and transparent’. They say the focus is on productivity, unemployment, skills, transport and commercial and dwelling vacancy rates when working out priority. The government last week updated its list of areas in category one - considered most in need of levelling up and first in line for funding.Places including Chorley, Wirral, Kirklees and Allerdale and Copeland, have been upgraded to category one. Rishi Sunak ’s affluent constituency Richmondshire, in Yorkshire, is also in that category.Salford, however, remains category two and is the only place in Greater Manchester not in the top category.

A source told the Sun: “He was meant to stay invisible during the Platinum Jubilee so there is no way he will be at events like Trooping the Colour.  “But the Queen needs a chaperone on all occasions at the moment due to her mobility issues and Andrew has earmarked the Derby as the one he will accompany her at. “He just doesn’t seem to understand the public outcry.” Prince Andrewaposs role in the royal family has come into question following the end of the civil suit brought by Ms Giuffre earlier this year. He made no admission of guilt but settle the case for an undisclosed sum, understood to be £m. The settlement came in the months after he ed his military titles and royal patronages to the Queen. Amid such acrimony Andrew accompanied his mother to a memorial service for Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey this week. Prince Charles and nephew Prince William are said to have made their displeasure about the role Andrew played clear to the Queen.They did not want Andrew to be the one to accompany Her Majesty into the service on Tuesday, and reportedly spoke to her more than once to raise their concerns. The Queen went ahead and her so-called favourite son was the one seen across the world helping her along the aisle at Westminster Abbey, as the service was broadcast live on the BBC.The two heirs to the throne were said to have been “shocked” and dismayed” as Andrew emerged front and centre.  A source close to the Palace told the Mirror: [Andrew] was straight out the blocks in front of the cameras when the Duke of Edinburgh died, which was seen within the family as being completely inappropriate. “Now this situation has unfolded, a fair few hold the view that he is manipulating his position for his own gains. Vanity Fairaposs Royal Editor Katie Nicholl said the Queen deliberately chose to have Andrew play such a prominent role on the day and shows the public she still aposmakes the decisionsapos. Katie Nicholl said: This was the Queenaposs way of showing two things one, that the buck stops with her, and she makes the decisions, and secondly that she believes heaposs innocent. She made the point very, very clearly.  But Charles and William were very aware of the perspective, of the optics of this. Unfortunately, this picture [of Prince Andrew escorting the Queen] has overtaken what should have been a memorial to a great man. Andrew has spent a considerable amount of time with the ailing -year-old monarch, who has suffered from a series of health problems in recent months as well as recovering from Covid.The Duke of York, who lives on the Windsor estate, has also been ever present at his mother’s Windsor Castle home after the death of her beloved husband Prince Philip, who died last April aged .

Wheelie bins were laid side-by-side in a busy Birmingham street in a bid to stop other drivers pulling in.But that didnapost stop one driver, with a people carrier seen double parked next to the bins, narrowing the lanes for approaching traffic. A shocked passer-by who saw the scene in Oldfield Road, Balsall Heath, told Birmingham Live : I was walking back to my car from a funeral and I saw it on the way.The bins were flat and did not have waste in them. The white people carrier parked there next to the bins.It was double parked next to the bins. The car was sticking out into the road. The bin was placed so the lids did not open. It was ridiculous. It was taking up two spaces. There were no dropped kerbs. It was not anyoneaposs driveway. The wheelie bins were the latest in a long line of obstacles used by householders to desperately claim blink-and-youaposll-miss them on-road spaces.In March, fuming residents resorted to using rock-filled trollies to reserve parking spaces.Two trollies were seen placed facing each other outside homes in Sparkbrook, weighted down with slabs of concrete. Rocks had also been wedged behind the wheels to secure them in place.  And one driver was left stunned after finding a wheelie bin aposselfishlyapos chained to the ground to save a car parking space. Chad Miah was trying to find a parking space near his friendaposs house when he came across a wheelie bin blocking an empty parking space, when he went to move it Chad was astonished to find the bin was chained to the ground. Chadaposs friend was getting married and the only parking spot nearby had a wheelie bin anchored into the tarmac blocking anyone form using it, Birmingham Live reports.Chad tried to wrench the obstacle free of its moorings near his friendaposs property in Handsworth, Birmingham, but found it was secured with a chain and a padlock to an anchor deep in the road.Furious Chad told reporters: My mate lives opposite and he was getting married on that day. I went to move the bin, but realised the person who did this had drilled it to the ground with a bolt and hook. The bin was attached to a metal chain and had a padlock on it. They must have gone through some effort to do it, just to save a parking space. I was yanking it, but it wasnapost moving. Iaposve seen it all now. Residents have gone to extraordinary s over the years to reserve much-coveted parking spaces in front of their homes. Some have placed cones, sofas as well as council bins to make sure they have somewhere to park.

And for lots of families, their shopping habits are the first thing to change - with cutting down on big brands and opting for supermarkets own branded ranges a good way to save money.A reporter for the Manchester Evening News shopped around Tescoaposs budget brands and Aldi Price Matches to see where savings can be made against the household brands.They were also left impressed by Tesco merging their cheaper ranges with the rest of their products, after scrapping its old aposEveryday Valueapos brand. With some of the products the reporter knew what they were getting as some food items were already a regular feature of their Tesco big shop - like the chicken goujons, cheese pizza and tortilla wraps.  In their everyday shop they refused to pay £. for a pack of branded wraps, when they decided they could get own-branded wraps for nearly half-price at p. During their shop, they said it was like they had stepped into a time machine and arrived back in the s, because of the foods they were getting as well as the prices. Some of the products they shopped were new, but aposrefreshinglyapos cheap with chicken kievs, £. for two, and potato croquettes, just p for g, two stand out products.  On top of prices like the s, the MEN reporter was left thrilled at the prospect of some aposblast from the pastapos puddings like Angel Delight, especially at only p a pack. On top of that, there was a number of other treats they loved from Tescoaposs Ms Mollyaposs range from flapjack traybake and ice cream roll, to milk lollies and trle. Whilst not quite the branded Mr Kipling given the price dference it was a no brainer for the reporter. The tray of flapjack was just p for g, less than half the price of Tescoaposs £ pack of flapjack bites . After the reporter got past the sweet treats, they found plenty to make substantial from the budget range. Aided by the Aldi Price Matches, on some meat and fruit and frozen veg, such as the g bag of broccoli and caullower florets for p and the g bag of Groweraposs Harvest garden peas for just p, they said the meals were aposcheap as chipsapos.  They were also left pleasantly surprised by the quality of fish and chips theyaposd made, and the cut-rate price they made it for. With the .kg of Hearty Food Co straight cut for p, Growers Harvest British mushy peas G for p and the Hearty Food Co four breaded fish fillets G for £., the meal worked out at around p a head. The Willow Farm whole chicken, at £., was enough for a Sunday dinner, and they still had some meat leftover to stick in a curry afterwards. However, despite the price, not all of the products went down well. Instead of the classic Heinz beans, they opted for p Stockwell  Co baked beans which were less popular and they were unable to persuade anyone to eat the chicken paste butty they bought. Although, not all of the bargains went down badly, the Stockwell  Co teabags, at just p for , less than half what youaposd pay for Tetley or a similar brand were said to have made a pretty decent brew.

Frank Adozi tricked the vulnerable woman by claiming he was working on an oil rig and he had taken the wrong bank card with him. The swindler would use his ill-gotten gains to fund an exotic lestyle, buying designer clothes, a high-end Range Rover and large amounts of jewellery.The -year-old used a fake profile on a dating website and presented himself as a middle-aged man called Michael McCarthy, police said. Azozi, of Sherwood, Nottingham, was jailed at the cityaposs crown court on Friday for four years after pleading guilty to  representation. One victim, who was in a vulnerable position after a recent split from her partner, was contacted and scammed out of the vast amount of money over a two-month period. In this time frame, the woman made  transactions that totalled £,. - money that she expected him toso that she could buy a house. She rumbled Adoziaposs organised operation in May  and reported him to police, saying he seemed aposniceapos and aposgenuineapos but that she was emotionally blackmailed into sending large amounts of money. Adozi was arrested after officers noticed he was a wanted fraudster during a traffic stop on January , . His mobile phone was analysed and it was found that he had targeted at least six other women, conning them out of nearly £, combined. In a witness statement, the woman revealed the depths Adozi went to in order to trick her into parting with £,. It read: He explained to me he was born in Australia and grew up in the United States. He said in  he relocated to the UK to be with his we Lisa who had now sadly died. He had a -year-old daughter Tamara who was attending a boarding school in New York. He told me he was thinking of leaving the dating site as he was worried about attracting the wrong kind of person who would just be after his money. He came across as a nice family man who was down-to-earth and genuine.Adozi was a prolic fraudster who had previously been jailed for four-and-a-half years for similar offences - he was released from prison in  but soon ed to his old ways. On his dating profile, he described himself as ft tall, from Nottingham and . He added that he had a masteraposs degree and was looking for a aposreal relationshipapos. Adozi was rumbled after making an error over flight times. He claimed he was catching a flight from Dubai to the UK but there were no flights available at the time. Det Con Carl Miller, of Nottinghamshire Policeaposs fraud investigation team, said he was pleased Adozi is now behind bars and unable to harm further women. He said: Adozi had no regard for his victims. He went to great s to build rapport and gain their trust, before fabricating stories to exploit them out of thousands. The fact that one victim lost £, - money she planned to buy a house with - makes this one of the worst romance frauds weaposve ever come across. It is also a unique case in that the fraudster operated from the UK as opposed to being based overseas. Fraudsters like Adozi target people in vulnerable situations and have no care that they may financially ruin their victims. In this case, a number of victims were identied who had not contacted police. We want to encourage all those who think theyaposve been a victim of romance fraud to not feel embarrassed or ashamed but rather report it.Romance fraud is a particularly callous offence and Nottinghamshire Police will always seek to get justice for victims.We do this because not only do fraudsters inflict financial loss on their victims, they also cause an enormous amount of emotional hurt and pain.

The start of April feels more like January and wintry conditions, swept in by icy north Atlantic air, are set to continue this week.Long-range forecasters predict more freezing weather will strike mid-month, raising the chance of the UK’s first white Easter in five years.Today, bookmakers slashed the odds on this being the coldest April on record. But while many of us have shivered indoors, working outwe can afford to put on the heating again, others have made the most the ­bracing conditions outside.  Skiers and snowboarders hit the slopes at Lecht Ski Centre in the Scottish Highlands as hardy jet skiers and sea swimmers braved the waves in the North East. And dog walkers wrapped up warm to take their pets for a stroll in Richmond Park, West London.

But for some reason, we still keep trying, even when the odds are stacked against us and we know that anyone listening to the forced conversation and bad jokes will be curling in on themselves with secondhand embarrassment.And to prove that point, one Tesco employee on TikTok has shared some of the most common things customers say to her when they put their shopping on the conveyor belt - and all of them make her cringe.The worst part  I know Iaposve definitely said each one at least once, and I bet you have too. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Holly Dixon posted a video in which she listed some of the things she hears at least  times each sht while working on the tills at Tesco, including the cringeworthy joke people always make whenever an item doesnapost want to scan.In the clip, posted to her @hollydixon account, she explained the first thing she hears every day is customers telling her they only came in for one thing, despite having what seems like the whole shop in their trolley.Next up was the classic joke: Oh, itaposs not scanning  It must be free! To which an unimpressed Holly simply wrote in text on the video: Absolutely not.  Finally, the employee said she isnapost fond of customers who say she looks bored and state theyaposre going to give her something to do by choosing her till for their shopping. She said: I was happy chilling and counting down the minutes until I finish. In the comments, some people shared their own experiences with working in supermarkets as they quoted other popular phrases that customers use whenever theyaposre at work. One person said: I get askedIaposm worried about losing my jobthey use the self-service till. While another added: Or they ask for a lottery ticket and then go aposthe winning one would be goodapos when you ask what one they want. And others admitted theyaposve definitely used these common sayings at least once, with one user posting: I hold my hand up that Iaposm probably one of these people that say these things.

Nigel Watson has written several books about aliens and is an expert on the subject, so he was alarmed by what he read online, as the Daily Star reports. On a public forum for drone pilots, there was a plan for people to adorn their crafts with lights and fly over major cities in a coordinated aposinvasionapos to fool people on April Fools Day. Nigel said that had the plan gone ahead, people around the world would have believed aliens were actually invading and it could have caused mass panic. What do you think about the hoax  Let us know in the comments...Nigel, who wrote UFOs of the First World War and Captured by Aliens, said: At the time, it was publicly accessible, but now you have to be a member.I don’t agree with hoaxing. Nonetheless, some people have secretly conducted hoaxes to ‘scientically’ test the reactions of UFO investigators and the public.The hoax organisers asked drone owners around the world to rig LED lights on their devices and fly them in areas where they could be seen by the public at a designated time in April, .  At least  drone hobby groups were involved, in the USA, the UK, France, South Africa and the Netherlands. Nigel says the hoax was originally planned for April , but the date was later changed to April  so that it will not seem like an obvious prank. Nigel wrote about the hoax plans but due to an unfortunate misunderstanding was briefly suspected of being behind the plot himself. Nevertheless, by publicising the hoax, he encouraged the drone operators to give up on their plan.  With social media to boost the effectiveness of any hoax, there’s no way of knowing how far, or how fast, the news would have spread. Nigel says that one or two “social experiment” UFO hoaxes were conducted in the Warminster area years ago. He speculates that one of these experiments could be behind his own “sighting”. Nigel classes himself as an “optimistic sceptic” with a strong interest in UFOs but he’s never actually seen one. He said: The nearest I got to a UFO encounter was in the late s, when I visited the famous Cradle Hill near Warminster, which was a UFO hotspot in the s.

A group of us went up Cradle Hill to look for UFOs but we saw nothing spooky except the staring eyes of sheep in a nearby field. It was only when we were driving to Frome that we saw a UFO in the distance. Along with two other cars, we stopped at the side of the road to watch a group of lights slowly flying towards us, it just looked like a scene from Close Encounters of the Third Kind! After a few minutes, much to our disappointment mixed with relief, we heard the sound of engines and saw that the object was an airship with lights attached to it. If it had not got closer we would have been convinced that we had seen a flying saucer.

A study by UCL three years ago revealed that for a straight couple in full time employment, the woman was five times more likely to do  hours of chores each week. Andyou feel your partner isnapost pulling their weight, it can be incredibly frustrating to get home from a long day of work to find you still have to cook dinner, iron and take the bins out. One woman who reckons her fiancé isnapost doing his bit has come up with a genius solution to make him realise how much she does around the house, Grazia reports. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Posting on Reddit, she explained: [My fiancé] was a self-admitted mama’s boy and went directly from his parents’ house to our shared home. After the pair moved in together, it wasnapost long before his untidy habits began to get on her nerves and after three weeks she confronted him. However, she claims her confused beau was struck by her accusation that heaposs messy and insisted she was mistaken. After the pair argued over the issue, the womanaposs fiancé came up with an idea to prove himself - they would split the house and each take responsibility for cleaning one half. The woman decided to take his offer literally - and got out her masking tape.  She then used the tape to ide every single room in the house right down the middle - including the fridge and the kitchen counters. After her fiancé initially suggested splitting the cleaning duties for two months, the woman decided just one was enough to prove her point. Unsurprisingly, the fiancéaposs side of the house fell into a bad state very quickly. The woman wrote: ‘Not even a week in and his half looked like a pigsty. She added she made some exceptions to her rule and cleaned the toilet and the shower throughout the month, which were technically on her fiancéaposs side. I was not about to use a filthy bathroom to make a point, she explained. The woman claimed that when the month-long experiment was up, her fiancé saw the light and couldnapost deny that she does signicantly more housework than him. She said he bought her flowers and chocolate and apologised for his behaviour - and then started learning how to be a responsible adult. And eight years on, it seems like the experiment worked wonders as the pair are still together and about to get married - with the woman describing her beau as an amazing man.

But one woman on Reddit has been left particularly baffled after she spent the night with a man sheaposs been dating for the past year, who then asked her the following dayshe wanted to cook a nice meal together. And while that might sound like a nice date idea, there was one big caveat - he apparently only wanted her to cook with him, and had no intention of letting her stay to actually eat the food theyaposd cooked. In her post, the woman explained: So yesterday I met with the guy I’ve been dating for the past year. During the date there was some friction, but we ended up talking it out. I slept at his place since we live in dferent cities, and the following day he asked meI wanted to cook a nice meal together.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. This is something we like to do together for fun and would make up for the s****y evening. I think he suggested this because he knows I like cooking and spending time with him, so it would make me feel better. Great! Lovely idea, I was very excited to spend some quality time cooking and eating together because we’re both foodies. So fast forward. We’re walking through the supermarket getting groceries for some elaborate -hour recipe we’re going to make. We’re walking past the veggie aisle or something when he suddenly mentions: ‘By the way, remind me to save you some food so you can have some as well.’ I’m like ‘Uh sorry what do you mean save some food ’ The woman then revealed that her date actually had some friends coming over for dinner who would be eating the food with him, and he wasnapost planning on letting her stay to eat with them. And when she was upset with the idea, her date got very irritated and blamed her for making assumptions about their dinner plans.  She added: Apparently, he has some friends coming over for dinner and I wasn’t invited to stay and actually eat the dinner. He wanted me to cook a -hour recipe with him, but failed to mention that I couldn’t participate in the eating part. I got quiet and upset because I was looking forward to spending some quality time with him eating great food and making up for a not so fun date. I also felt stupid and unimportant because of this. He got very irritated with me for ‘making assumptions that I would stay over for dinner’ and then being quiet and upset and avoidant about it when he told me I couldn’t. I told him I was actually quite upset that he didn’t tell me I couldn’t eat the dinner I would be cooking with him. He’d never asked me to stay for dinner: he’d just asked me to cook dinner with him and forgot to mention that I couldn’t stay to eat it. He got mad at me for being upset and therefore avoidant about it. I can see why it can be frustrating when I get upset, because I get very quiet and cold avoidant. I’m aware this is a problem and I’m working on it. On the other hand, I feel like he should have communicated better and maybe cared about my feelings a little more. He normally is a great person and this incident feels way out of character. The woman explained she ended up not cooking dinner with her date, and commenters on the Reddit post said she did the right thing by walking away from the situation. One said: Regardless of the type of relationship you have with him, you assumed what . per cent of people would assume in that situation: that you would be cooking a meal to share dinner together. As another added: Itaposs crazy that he thinks that would be an incorrect assumption on your part. Of course you assumed youaposd be eating with him because thataposs the normal thread of logic.

Hannah, , had been with her friend Cheslin Marsh in a secluded part of Stellenbosch, South Africa when their car was stopped by a pack of wolves gang who held them up at knepoint in May . The pair were taken hostage and driven around by the thugs for hours, before they nearly beat Cheslin to death and dumped his body. The gang then proceeded to repeatedly gang-rape Hannah, stabbed her in the neck and dropped a ft rock on her head. The abhorrent killers, Nashville Julius, , Geraldo Parsons, , Eben Van Niekerk, , and Vernon Witbooi, showed no remorse as they were sentenced to jail for le in .  Now a new documentary five years on has shed light on the events that took place before Hannahaposs tragic death and how her family struggled to come to terms with her ordeal. Hannahaposs mother, Anna, drowned just a year after the studentaposs death as she took her daily swim - her battered body spotted in shallow waters in Cape Town, The Sun reports.Hannahaposs father Willem said the impact of his daughteraposs death on the family was “beyond devastating” and said his we “walked into the ocean and didnapost ”.He added: I believe our family died with Hannah. Annaaposs death was ruled as a fatal accident, and while Willem claimed he did not believe his we intended to kill herself he added that she lacked the physical or mental strength to deal with the horrying slaughter of her daughter.The night of terror began for Hannah and Cheslin, on May , , when the pair were heading home from a night out. Hannah had offered Cheslin a lt home but while the pair were parked up, CCTV captured the moment the four strong gang encircled the vehicle. Armed with a screwdriver and flick kne they forced Cheslin into the backseat and then the boot while Hannah was cramped between the two front seats. Talking during the new documentary, Cheslin said: I kept telling her, basically, to stay calm the whole time...everything is going to be okay.The gang were again caught on CCTV as they drove to a nearby petrol station to withdraw money from a cash machine with Cheslinaposs card, but were given the wrong pin. During a police interview, Witbooi describes how terried Hannah didnapost talk at all and just looked out in front of her. The callous killers even offered her a glimmer of hope, claiming they wanted to take them both home - but the student would never see her loved ones again. After driving them to a remote area, Cheslin was beaten with bricks and left for dead, but miraculously survived the attack.  He said: They were taking me into the bushes...and then they told me I should lay my head on a piece of brick and thataposs when I realised these people are gonna take my le away. And as I was laying on the brick, I closed my eyes and prayed and asked the Lord for forgiveness for whatever I did in this le. Because I definitely knew Iaposm gonna go to another one and I didnapost want to go. Traumatised Cheslin awoke from the brutal attack partially deaf and not knowing whether Hannah was dead or alive.  In fact Hannah had been driven to a farm road, where the gang claimed they had planned to leave her alive until she began to struggle and was stabbed in the neck. During the trial, Parsons said they believed they had killed Cheslin and admitted being the first one to rape Hannah.According to Times Live, he told the trial: She didn’t want to climb out of the boot. She was holding on to the car. She started panicking.“Eben came up and stabbed her.  But family friends of Hannahaposs claimed she would have tried to comply with her killersapos requests and even empathise with them in a bid to survive. After killing Hannah, the men continued their terrying crime spree, chasing a woman walking to work in nearby Kraaontein before stealing her bag and phone. The group were then arrested following a high-speed police chase after Hannahaposs car was spotted by undercover cops. Her cruel killers were sentenced to a combined  years behind bars with three out of four facing le sentences following the trial at Cape Town high court.  Her heartbroken father Willem admitted during the trial that it had taken him a while to attend the court hearing because he didnapost want to hear what had happened to his beloved daughter - who was described as a aposdaddyaposs girlapos. Willem and Anna went on to create the Hannah Cornelius Foundation to help children in their local area get into education and escape violence within their community. Friend Toni, who went on to become director for the foundation told the Sun Online: Hannah was never a typical child, teenager or adult. She was always unusually compassionate and empathic and deeply moved by the people she encountered, their stories and their struggles. The way in which she saw the world and wrestled with her place and purpose therein was paradoxically both mature and innocent.  Hannah could be naively carefree and even careless at times. A dreamer. An idealist. Distracted and curious. But not many people saw her struggles and her personal suffering, which she carried bravely and faced fearlessly. Hannah loved completely. Firstly her parents and brother, but also friends and often even strangers. She suspended judgement and sought to know and understand. Itaposs easy to idealise the dead. Especially the young, beautul and tragically taken. But Hannah really was everything people say she was. And more.

Intelligence analysts Dragonfly correctly predicted Russia would invade Ukraine and now they claim Putin could be oustedthe West ramps up sanctions that trigger a financial crisis. It comes as Ukraine says its forces have seized back all areas around the capital of Kyiv with Russian troops pulling back as war drags on and another of Putinaposs top Russian colonels is killed.As Western sanctions target Russian business, Putin finds himself under pressure to keep his key advisers on side amid uncertainty over what happens when he can no longer guarantee their financial security. In a Dragonfly briefing, intelligence analysts said it’s likely to highly likely that President Putin will not be in the position he is within the next two years, reports The Sun.Putinaposs fate reportedly lies in the hands of six of his closest allies - Sergei Naryshkin, head of the foreign intelligence service, defence minister Sergei Shoigu, former head of the FSB internal security service Alexander Bortnikov, head of Russia’s Security Council Nikolai Patrushev, head of state-owned Rostec Sergei Chemezov and oligarch Igor Sechin.Dragonfly suggests rather than a military coup, what we would be more likely to see a group of squat men in ill-fitting suits walking into the Kremlin. President Putin then being explained as either ill or having to step down for other reasons – family reasons and so on. Speculation has been re over Putinaposs health and state of mind with some experts suggesting he may be taking steroids as a treatment for cancer - which can trigger nasty side effects, including rapid mood swings, behavioural changes, confusion and altered cognitive patterns In recent public appearances, Putin - known in Russia for his strong man image - has looked bloated and noticeably weakened when compared to earlier images. The decline in his physical state has led outsiders to wonderheaposs battling a serious illness as others claim his decisions relating to the Ukraine war may be caused by psychological instability.  It comes as horrying details emerge of mass killings and Ukrainian men being slaughtered in the street, in the previously Russian occupied areas around Kyiv.Ukrainian forces have been greeted with scenes of dead bodies littering the streets. At least  people were found dead in the village of Bucha, after Russian forces left the settlement. Photos show the widespread destruction and horric actions of the Russian armies as video footage shows Ukrainian troops having to slalom their trucks down the streets to avoid all the dead bodies.

A video posted online showed the tail of a Mi-N helicopter being snapped off over the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine  Wallace had previously vowed to send more “lethal aid” to Ukraine after Russia invaded in February. Kelin told Kremlin News agency TASS: “All arms supplies are destabilizing, particularly those mentioned by [UK Defense Secretary Ben] Wallace. “They exacerbate the situation, making it even bloodier. Apparently, those are new, high-precision weapons. “Naturally, our armed forces will view them as a legitimate targetthose supplies get through the Ukrainian border.” President Zelensky said his troops had taken back at least  towns, including Irpin and the Hostomel air base on the outskirts of the capital.It also regained control of the heavily contaminated Chernobyl nuclear site. He said that while Ukrainian forces had regained  towns in the Kyiv region, the battle raging in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region and Kharkiv remained “extremely dficult”. Zelensky said: “The occupiers are withdrawing forces in the north of our country. The withdrawal is slow but noticeable. “Somewhere they are expelled with battles. Somewhere they leave positions on their own.” The MoD said Russian forces were withdrawing from the area around Kyiv, as Ukrainian forces advanced. The MoD’s intelligence assessment said: “Ukrainian forces continue to advance against withdrawing Russian forces in the vicinity of Kyiv.  “Along the north western axis, Ukrainian forces’ attempts to advance from Irpin towards Bucha and Hostomel are ongoing. “Russian forces are reported to have withdrawn from Hostomel airport, which has been subject to fighting since the first day of the conflict. “Along the eastern axis, Ukraine has re-taken several villages.” Zelensky said more than , people had escaped the besieged Mariupol – which has faced weeks of ferocious Russian shelling – through a humanitarian corridor in a convoy of buses and cars. At least , have been killed in the city and the estimated , who remain face shortages of food, water and electricity. Defence sources last night said that Nato is planning to send tanks to Ukraine.  Polish T-s could start arriving in days. Zelenskyy has been calling on Nato to send tanks and aircraft to help force the Russians out of his country. Putin’s negotiators this week said that Russian forces would ease back from attacks on Kyiv and northern Ukraine although shelling has continued and there is a fear that they are simply regrouping. Colonel Richard Kemp, a former British Infantry commander, said: “It’s not clear whether the Russians were ever intending to fight through Kiev street by street. “It is more likely Putin hoped Zelensky would capitulate as soon as Russia invaded and Kiev was threatened. “Encircling Kiev may also have been intended to fix Ukrainian forces in the city, preventing reinforcements being sent south and east to defend against Russian offensive action there. “It looks like they now wish to withdraw forces from the Kiev area to complete operations in Donbas. “That does not mean they won’t continue to attack Kiev and the surrounding area with artillery and air.” The UK has insisted it will not put troops on the ground in Ukraine but, along with NATO allies, it will supply defensive support to President Zelensky’s troops. The UK provided , anti-tank weapons.

The Ukrainian has shot down two Russian jets and a helicopter in the week since she left university to join the war effort. Sources say the woman has become an expert at firing the Igla surface-to-air missile launcher – which ironically is Russian-made. Her identity is being kept secret amid fears Russian agents will try to assassinate her. At least  Russian aircraft are believed to have been destroyed in the war so far. Defence sources have said that one of the aircraft destroyed is believed to have been an SU-, combat aircraft.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mozart to jazz trio ecossaise delight ardrishaig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Arts Associationwas delighted to welcome Trio Ecossaise as guest performers at Ardrishaig Public Hall for the fourth concert of the season.The impact of Covid has meant that many planned concerts had to be cancelled or dates changed so it was wonderful to have Trio Ecossaise perform on March .The concert opened with the Kegelstatt Trio by Mozart. Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

Instead, be kind to each other, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.#Another image comes to mind, of the Ukrainians who caught a young Russian soldier, only to give him a drink, something to eat and a mobile phone to call his parents."},{"url":null,"title":"april gardening plants that make you smile","story":"Making the best use of the ening days is a bonus and, providing the weather stays fair, it can be a brilliant gardening month.In addition to dead-heading spring bulbs, now is the time to get planting so why not think about one or two new additions to your garden that will make you feel really happy.A survey carried out at the Cha Flower Show identied the top three plants in the UK that are most likely to put a smile on your face – lily of the valley, sweet pea and jasmine – so they might make good additions to your garden this year.Lily of the valley can be planted in borders or underneath a tree and they are very low maintenance and easy to grow # but beware they are toxic to dogs.They make good ground cover for shady spots and are beautully fragrant with creamy white bell-shaped nodding flowers.Sweet pea is available in a huge iety of bright and pastel colours with frilly, delicate and often sweetly fragrant flower heads.They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter.All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.If you want to make the children happy, there are some fun options for them to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o’clock flower.The sunflower is a real family favourite. If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

that work was already being carried out at one council base to revise office space, with staff who no longer required a desk asked to “de-personalise” their spaces.The Penston House office rationalisation project has looked at changing the council offices at its Macmerry site.And councillors were told that staff had been involved in the changes through a series of ‘town hall’ meetings, with similar plans for council offices at Randall House, also in Macmerry, and the council’s Haddington headquarters, John Muir House.A council spokesperson said: “The rationalisation project is following the identication of how best to use existing office space and to create appropriate workplaces.“For many, this is simply the requirement for ‘hot desking’ areas, whereas for others there may be a need to retain an identied space for either iniduals or teams.“The next stage is that those who will no longer require a set desk or office will be asked to ‘de-personalise’ their existing workplace and remove personal belongings, and also identy required files for central storage.“This process will then be repeated in Randall House and John Muir House.”Councillors were asked to approve

Overdrafts are rising at an alarming rate and several Scottish farmers have already sold off sows to cut losses.The pig sector encountered signicant disruption during the Covid- pandemic which affected processing capacity and saw the partial closure of Scotland’s largest pig abattoir facility at Brechin.Much to the disappointment of NFU Scotland, several major retailers have continued to stock signicant volumes of imported pork, undermining, the union says, home production.And the dramatic spike in animal feed prices in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has also signicantly increased the scale of current losses on pig farms.It is in the interests of Scottish consumers, processors, and retailers, adds the union, that farmgate prices for pigs rise immediately to stave off a rapid rate of herd liquidations.Speaking on behalf of NFU Scotland, Mr Wyllie thanked the Cabinet Secretary for the pig hardship scheme in Scotland, established following the Covid-driven closure of the Brechin abattoir, but called on her to consider further immediate, direct support for the sector to ensure a critical mass of production was preserved.He also asked for the Scottish Government to consider an ‘Ongoers’ loan scheme to help financially support those who saw their future in the industry.NFU Scotland called on the Scottish Government to seek greater retailer support for Scottish pork, highlighting that a small percentage increase in the volume of home-produced pork on supermarket shelves would make a considerable dference.Help in re-establishing the Chinese export licence at Brechin, lost because of the Covid outbreak at the plant, would also expand the market opportunities for Scottish pig producers.At a UK level, NFU Scotland called for the Scottish Government to push Westminster on the need for “proper border controls” to monitor pork imports and for the English language requirements for overseas butchers looking to come to the UK to work in the staff-strapped processing sector to be relaxed."},{"url":null,"title":"world-cup-2022-draw-watch","story":"At the moment  out of the  countries that will take part in the competition are set, with there still being three intercontinental playoff matches to take place before the final set of teams is listed.The fate of Wales and Scotland is still hanging in the balance in one of those playoff matches, whilst England qualied top of their group at the first stage of qualying.Heres all the information on the draw including, where to watch it.The #Qatar draw is coming today! 🤯 Tune in tonight to find out the fate of your nation.Which team do you want to avoid  Comment below!#NowIsAll pic cZYFHdZSNThe draw for the tournament takes place on Friday, April , at the DECC venue in Doha, Qatar at circa pm BST.BBC One will air coverage of the draw, with the programme starting at .pm, and this will also be available to livestream on BBC iPlayer.The  teams will be drawn into eight groups of four teams, with Qatar assured a spot in Group A.The other nations will be split into four pots based on FIFA rankings.Each group will have no more than one nation from any confederation, aside from Europe which can have no more than two nations in any one group.Pot ATime to meet your destiny.Find out who your nation will play at #QatarTonight, pm Doha time 🔮 pic mAmpNXIzzPot BPot CPot DThe playoff matches that are yet to be contested are:"},{"url":null,"title":"reveals-north-berwick-one-uks-best-seaside-towns","story":"The town received an overall rating of %.The list was compiled by reviews from more than , visitors who gave feedback on their recent trips to seaside towns, villages and resorts.Destinations were rated on their beaches, attractions, value for money, peace and quiet, and scenery.North Berwick scored the following for these categories:Beach:  Attractions:  Value for money:  Peace and quiet:  Scenery:  On Tripadvisor, visitors to North Berwick praise the town for its day trips, excursions and sights to see.

Carrots have a fascinating - and somewhat controversial - history.To mark the annual event, here are nine fascinating facts you probably didnt know about carrots.... Carrots werent originally orangeThe carrots sold in supermarkets these days are almost exclusively orange, but the earliest documented plants produced purple, yellow or white ieties.Theres some dispute about whether Dutch horticulturalists bred orange carrots in the th century to honour of William of Orange , but whatever the reason, the new colour became dominant. You could say, back then, orange was the new purple.... They originate in AsiaNow popular all over the world, the carrot as we know it today was first grown in Afghanistan in the th century. The first reference to the veggie being grown in the UK on field scale was in Somerset in the s.. Theres a huge range of carrot ietiesToday, there are actually hundreds of types of carrots ying in colour and size. And theyve got some rather unusual names, such as Solar Yellow, Red Elephant, Purple Dragon, Five-Star Baby and Little Fingers.. Baby carrots arefakeThe bags of smooth, peeled, unormly shaped baby carrots you see in supermarkets are usually cut from full-size carrots for the convenience of shoppers.However, genuine baby carrots - harvested before they reach maturity - do exist. You can identy a true babyits got its skin on, and a defined shoulder section at the top.. Carrots are mostly waterWhile theyre brilliantly bright in colour, carrots are actually made up of % water, which is why old, dried out carrots lose their crunch.. They might help you see in the darkThe old adage about carrots helping you see in the dark is said to have come about during the World War II, when the UKs Ministry of Food wanted the public to believe the success of night-time air raids was down to pilots munching lots of the veggies, which are rich in a nutrient called beta-carotene.However, its not quite as simple as that. Beta-carotene has been shown to help improve night vision, but only in people who have a vitamin A deficiency, which is unlikely nowadays in developed countries.. Cooking carrots makes them healthierBeta-carotene is used by the body to make vitamin A, an important nutrient in terms of vision, skin health and the immune system. While some nutrientscan be lost through cooking, a study found that cooked carrots, rather than raw ones, actually led to higher absorption of beta-carotene.. Eat too many and you might turn yellowConsuming large quantities of carrots wont turn you orange, as you might expect. It could, however, results in carotenemia, when an excess of beta-carotene gives the skin a yellow-ish tinge..

Then we have the institutionalised cultural corruption of the corporate lobbying, directorships, revolving doors and political donations .It has been alleged that the way the UK Government handled bids for supplying personal protective equipmentand other Covid- response contracts was biased in favour of those with political access. Some  contracts have been identied as possibly corrupt, some  per cent of contracts awarded between the beginning of the pandemic and November . How did this happen  Well, safeguards to prevent corruption were suspended. The cost to the taxpayer  This has been estimated at £. billion. That’s a lot of ferries.I am sure this will be met with charges of \"special pleading\", that independence supporters would let the SNP off with anything at all, that it is \"whataboutery\". However, as the saying goes, \"in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king\" and we should judge governments by their actions in the round, and not just focus on a single one, or only those where they have come up short. In this regard it is interesting that little is heard about free university tuition, no prescription charges, the baby box, free nursery care, the Scottish Child Payment , lowest student loan debt in the UK, water still being publicly owned, to identy only a small sample.Perhaps though its most signicant achievement is no Russian oligarchs around Holyrood, or indeed cash for questions or for access, or awarding contracts worth millions to the pals of government ministers. One might expect Holyrood, and the Scottish Government, to \"learn\" from Westminster, but there are some lessons it has missed, and that is to our benefit.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.* BOB McDougall may be right, he may be wrong, but one thing is for sure: given that everything in le is relative – fat-thin, tall-short, empty-full and so on – this SNP Government is as close to perfection as possible compared to the Johnson Government. Whether the criteria is ability or attitude, humanitarian, level of achievement, or anything , compared to the current Conservative Government in London this SNP Government is very good indeed.George Archibald, West Linton.PARTY IS JUST A MEANS TO AN ENDBOB McDougall seems to think that were Scotland to achieve independence, it would become a one-party state, permanently ruled by the SNP. Unionists often peddle this myth in an attempt to sway voters.As the only party supporting independence, the SNP is a necessary means to that end. When we achieve independence, the other parties will accept that reality and make their own cases to the electorate.The only reason the SNP would be in government would be because both its record in government and its electoral manesto appealed to a sufficient number of the electorate. That’s how democracy works.John McCallum, Glasgow.INDYREF THE BIGGEST THREAT TO SCOTLANDNEVER known to shy away from problems, unless it is to do with the ferries crisis, Nicola Sturgeon continues to promote her  independence referendum with vigour. She claims the \"biggest threat\" is not seizing the chance for independence and is now claiming there is \" massive potential\" in independence.The key word here is \"potential\", which can suggest success but equally can end in failure. On its own it does not signal which of these outcomes is more likely. When you leave this aside and just consider the position of Scotland today in a war-torn, energy-strapped, climate-crisis world the chances of success drop off exponentially, especially given the Scottish Governments current poor track record in health, education, industry, transport, the economy and even its own climate change targets.In light of all of this the biggest threat to Scotlands potential is actually Indyref itself.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.REFLECTIONS ON SILLINESSON being told by Aberdeenshire Council to remove pro-separatist signage from his garden, erected without planning consent, Alex Salmond responded by asking \"how much money [has been] wasted on this bureaucratic silliness\". Many of us ask the same question about the SNP administration under his and his successors leadership.Martin Redfern, Melrose.WHY JOHNSON MUST RESIGNFORMER Prime Minister David Cameron’s notorious description of his Old Etonian Bullingdon Club alumni Boris Johnson as a \"greased piglet\"’ is surely an apt characterisation of the man now occupying  Downing Street.Mr Johnson behaves like an entitled Arthur Daley – minus car coat and cigar – and now looks set to evade culpability, and the conventional resignation required of any MP, and especially a government minister, found guilty of misleadingParliament.Partygate is his Achilles heel and should signal his fall from what little grace he can muster, and from elected office ample broadcast evidence exists of him, inside Parliament and beyond, insisting on multiple occasions that, “all guidance was followed completely”and even, at times, bizarrely, that there were no parties.The threat of Tory MPs submitting sufficient letters to the  Committee during the Russian invasion of Ukraine has receded, gting the \"greased piglet\" a convenient get out of jail free card. But now he is insulting the nation’s intelligence, passing the buck and insisting he personally broke no Covid rules, splitting hairs with the anaemic excuse that he had been \"repeatedly assured” by others unidentied that there had been full compliance at all times.But there is a huge, gaping hole in the PM’s slippery, oleaginous alibi he was there, in the room, attending at least three of the said parties, or \"gatherings\" as he prefers to describe them. There is photographic evidence of a party in his No  flat – his home, not his office – and further corroboration of his birthday party in the Cabinet Room no question, no doubt, bang to rights.Prime Minister or no Prime Minister , war in Ukraine or no war in Ukraine, he must, for once, take responsibility and resign, and,not, immediately revoke every single fine and criminal record handed out to thousands of ordinary citizens for their breaches of Covid laws.Mike Wilson, Longniddry.RAIL PROPOSALS WILL COST TOO MUCHI WAS interested in the proposals detailed in your article on the Railfuture Scotland list of new railway stations across the Scottish network .As someone who has recently retired after nearly  years working in the railway industry I recognised many of the locations mentioned. During part of my Railtrack and Network Rail employment many of these were investigated and the cost of providing an attractive level of service at an affordable price to the taxpayer could not be justied. Whilst climate change and other world energy influences have changed the UK and Scottish governments strategies on public transport, any network enhancement must be affordable.The Edinburgh South Suburban Line passenger service would require changes to the signalling on the line to reduce headways, and, more importantly, capacity in the Haymarket to Portobello rail corridor would have to be created.This capacity issue was also a factor in the proposed Carlisle to Glasgow local service via the West Coast Main Line not being progressed. The provision of new stations at Beattock, Abington, Symington and Law would have had an adverse impact on cross-border passenger and freight services. This particular route is seeing increased freight and logistics use, which makes the introduction of any local service very challenging.The introduction of one new station on an existing railway will add a minute of three minutes to existing end-to-end journey times. This also has to be factored into existing services at strategic centres such as Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central.These are an ambitious set of proposals but the cost to the taxpayer will be high and it may be that light railor electric and hydrogen buses offer a better solution.Kevin A McCarthy, Glasgow.STRIKING THE WRONG NOTEIAIN Macwhirter is wrong when he writes that Cardf Philharmonic Orchestra removed Tchaikovsky compositions from its programme because he was Russian . The orchestra will, in fact play three concerts later this year with music by Rachmaninov, Prokofiev and Rimsky-Korsakov, all of whom were Russian.Orchestra members were uneasy about playing Marche Slav opus , and Overture  opus  with their Russian nationalism and triumphalism as well as Symphony No, which is nicknamed \"Little Russian\". The Overture  with its cannon fire and the former Russian national anthem was considered particularly inappropriate. Considering that one orchestral members partner is from Ukraine and still has family members trapped there, the orchestras management agreed to delete these items from the programme for now.Hugh Brennan, Kilbirnie."},{"url":null,"title":"go-wild-country-best-nature-days-easter","story":"And blessed with the beauty of Scotland on our doorsteps, there are a vast array of options to enjoy our green surroundings, making the most of the ening days and warmer temperatures and helping us take a break from the stresses and strains of these challenging days along the way.To offer up some helpful hints about ideal day out destinations, here are  top spots across the country worth a visit this half-term break to help you and the family reap the well-being benefits of getting back to nature.Dumfries House, Cumnock, AyrshireWhen Prince Charles saved Dumfries House for the nation in , the purchase included  acres of wider estate which includes an oasis of parkland, gardens and  acres of mature woodland to explore.

Any organism can be analysed.”Just as genomic sequencing has enabled scientists to track the emergence and spread of distinct Covid iants, it is expected to become a routine tool to pinpoint mutations in everything from legionella to Clostridium dficile and guide treatment and outbreak responses.Recently, Brown - an expert in Salmonella - used the technique to identy that two cases of the bacterial infection in Scotland were part of a UK-wide cluster affecting around  people.The outbreak, which sickened some young children and infants, was ultimately traced to a Lithuanian supplier of dead mice: pet owners were falling ill after feeding the infected rodents to snakes and other reptiles.Sequencing labs across Europe reported matching results and imports into the UK were banned.As well as rapid and highly accurate monitoring, information new strains and potentially worrying mutations can now be shared and compared internationally in real-time.“In the past samples would have to be packaged up and mailed around the world,” said Brown.“Obviously that was much slower, but potentially dangerous too - these are harmful pathogens.”Derek Brown with one of the GRI labs £, genomic sequencing machines To date, over , versions of Salmonella have been logged on the worldwide database.One particular Salmonella strain, known as XDR, has mutations which make it highly drug resistant. It is becoming more common but does respond to a lesser used antibiotic, azithromycin.Slowing or preventing the rise of antibiotic resistance is expected to be one of the most important uses of genomic sequencing for public health.Failing to do so would send humanity back to the \"dystopian pre-antibiotic days\", notes Leonard, when a quarter of patients died from post-operative infections.So far thousands of genes associated with antimicrobial resistance have been identied, with more added to the database all the time.: From Joseph Lister to X-rays - how Glasgow Royal Infirmary changed medicineLeonard believes the next five to  years will see a growth in \"personalised medicine\" to combat infections, driven by increased reliance on genomic sequencing.\"Well see a tailoring of drugs to particular strains - so an infected patient would be given the most appropriate antibiotic based on rapid sequencing of their bacterial isolates,\" he said.Sequencing is also important to understanding outbreaks and transmission, both in the community and in hospitals.Back in , Dr Diane Lindsay - GRIs legionella expert - worked with colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh to investigate a fatal outbreak of legionnaires disease in the capital linked to cooling towers.Sequencing revealed a \"really surprising\" ersity in the genetic make-up of the bacteria causing infections, including unexpected mutations associated with increased virulence.Dr Diane Lindsay, an expert in legionella More recently Lindsay has been monitoring an increase in Scottish cases of legionella longbeachae - so-called because it was first isolated from a patient in Long Beach, Calornia.\"Its a bit of a mystery,\" said Lindsay.\"Were seeing gardeners becoming infected - isolated cases rather than outbreaks. Probably from handling compost.\"To understand just how mammoth a task infection control can be it is worth noting that the average person has  times as many organisms living on and inside them as they do human cells.Staphylococci are the most common of all infectious organisms. Around  per cent of the population carry Staphylococcus aureus in their nose, and another % will pick it up intermittently.: Is Italys revolutionary mental health model finally coming to Scotland Around  to , samples are isolated from patients every year in Scotland. Mostly it is harmless, but around  samples a year are sent to GRI for sequencingthere is suspected cross-transmission.\"Its a sliding scale from harmless to an infection that will kill someone within  hours, depending on the strain or the patients condition,\" said Dr Andrew Robb, GRIs staphylococci specialist.\"Usually its not particularly virulent but its a good indicator for infection control because it is passed on through touch, and on surfaces.\"Dr Andrew Robb One of the advantages of DNA mutations - or RNA mutations in the case of viruses - is that they tend to occur at a fairly predictable rate, depending on the organism, which helps infection scientists to gauge whether a bug is spreading in a particular environment - such as a hospital ward.Dr Aleks Marek, a consultant microbiologist and senior infection control doctor at GRI, said: \"Covid is known not to mutate that quickly, so just because two people have got exactly the same strain and they happen to be in the same place, it doesnt necessarily mean theyve given it to each other.\"In the case of Staph aureus, weve been doing whole genome sequencing for a very long time so we have an idea of how long it takes for mutations to develop.\"That gives us an idea thatan isolate is this close to another there probably has been a transmission event, whereas this close probably doesnt mean theres been a transmission.\"Whole genome sequencing can also tell us whether the bacteria causing infection has a resistance determinant, and whether thats arising inidually in the community multiple times or whether theres some sort of spread going on.\"Soa particular resistant organism did look very similar in all the samples then we might start to think is there some spread , or the oppositeyouve got lots of bugs that look quite dferent genetically but happen share this one resistance gene.\"That helps to guide our response.\"Were really at the start of the journey with using whole genome sequencing, but more and more organisms are starting to come online. I think over the next while well start to use it much more.\""},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

The second vessel will follow in early .: Embarrassment: Two CalMac ferries to be built in TurkeyCMAL says the new vessels will bring an almost % increase in vehicle and freight capacity on the Islay routes, a reduction in emissions and improve the resilience of the wider fleet.The decision to rubber stamp the contract came despite the move being described as an \"embarrassment\" for the SNP by the Scottish Conservatives.It also comes after CMAL were accused of acting unlawfully over the awarding of the key contract, which the ferry owners deny.It comes in the wake of concern that the nationalised shipbuilder Ferguson Marine failed to get a look in when it pitched for the contract to build two new vessels to serve Islay.The ground-breaking Procurement ReformAct  when it was brought in was seen by many as a welcome move away from contracts awarded only on the basis of the lowest price towards those which offer the best long-term outcomes for Scotland’s communities and the environment.The Cemre Marin Endustri shipyardPublic contracts valued at £m or above have specic requirements in relation to community benefits in the authority area that a contract is issued.These should include training and recruitment, the availability of sub-contracting opportunities, partnership arrangements, provision of parts and equipment and how it is intended to improve the economic, social or environmental well-being of the area.If no community benefits are sought in a contract, a statement must be published justying the decision.CMAL said that they had been \"committed to encouraging the provision of community benefits through their contracts\" and recognised a \"contractual requirement\" in relation to training and recruitment and availability of sub-contracting opportunities.Finance secretary Kate Forbes stated that in line with the Procurement ReformAct , bidders for the Islay procurement process were required to detail the community benefits they are able to offer within their response to the invitation to tender.Submissions from the four yards were being evaluated including the responses to the community benefits section included within the original contract notice.Mr McEleny who had been pushing for community benefit assurances expressed shock at what he called \"a holiday to Turkey\" was being used as a valuable community benefit.\"The abject failure of re-industrialising the Clyde has resulted in a lucrative contract to build Scottish ferries in Turkey. Every single member of the Scottish Government should be embarrassed to set foot near the Clyde again.\"They could just take £, of the contract to go back to CMAL to spend at their leisure.\"Make no mistake, awarding this contract to Turkey is a political decision of the Scottish Government.\"Nicola Sturgeon’s lack of care over Scottish shipbuilding jobs being jeopardised by her government’s apathy is no dferent from Margaret Thatchers stance towards Clyde shipyard workers in the s.\"In a response to past concerns about the community benefits to Scotland, CMALs head of business support CMALs head of business support Brian Fulton said in a letter that the request for community benefits had only been \"advisory\".: Anger as state-owned Ferguson Marine loses £m CalMac ferries contract to overseas firmsThe Islay route is already one of the busiest services for freight on the Clyde and Hebrides network, and CMAL says that the incoming ferries will support the island’s vital economic activity.The four shortlisted shipyards were to submit their technical and commercial proposals for the design and construction of the two vessels.The successful initial bids were from Damen Shipyard in Romania, Remontowa Shipbuilding in Poland, and Turkish shipyards Sefine Denizcilik Tersanecilik Turizm, and Cemre Marin Endustri.But it was confirmed Ferguson Marine embarked in a bid for the contract through the initial Pre-Qualication Questionnaire process but failed to make the shortlist.It prompte Alex Salmonds Alba party to call on ministers to directly award all future CalMac ferry orders to nationalised Ferguson Marine and to create one integrated Ferries Scotland body.Ferguson Marine which runs the last remaining shipyard on the lower Clyde was nationalised after it financially collapsed in August , amid soaring costs and delays to the construction of two leline island ferries.It came five years after tycoon Jim McColl first rescued the yard when it went bust.The delivery of new island ferries MV Glen Sannox and Hull , which were due online in the first half of , are running at least five years late, with costs mushrooming to over £m.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"In  Nicola Sturgeon featured in a Standing up for Scotland video for the SNP at Ferguson Marine\",\"description\": \"In  Nicola Sturgeon featured in a Standing up for Scotland video for the SNP at Ferguson Marine\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media JBhRjvTp poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests JBhRjvTp.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": A spokesperson CMAL spokesman said: “Our contract with Cemre will see local iniduals and organisations benefit in a number of ways through both the donation and the offer of work experience for apprentices.

The forthcoming #designed# Superbloom event will celebrate nature by turning one of London’s most built-up areas into a blossoming, living flower field.Erlandhas been chosen to produce a gentle accompanying ambient soundscape for this urban garden, which will be played continuously through speakers, softening the noise of the city.He explained: #Music For Growing Flowers aims to enhance the Superbloom’s emotional impact by rebalancing the dominant city noises and intertwining specic audio frequencies to uncover harmony in the most bustling environments.Since music itself is nothing more than vibrations, perhaps it will help us enter more deeply into this subtle appreciation of place, curiosity and calm.”For his most recent album, the composer ed to his Orkney roots, actually planting the only existing Carves the Runes Then Be Content With Silence at a hidden location in the county.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s part of ambitious UK Government plans to turbo-charge our national recovery from COVID-. At the centre of this initiative is Jobcentre Plus.Jobcentre Plus has a long and successful track record of matching quality employers with quality candidates. Now, many highly-skilled people have found themselves unemployed for the first time, and are considering new roles in new sectors. Jobcentre Plus can quickly put companies in touch with candidates who can make a real dference to their businesses.We talk to employers and employees about how they have benefited from working with Jobcentre Plus. vw, px\"  ‘Working with Jobcentre Plus is a no brainer’: Jordan, Contracts Manager, Elite Scaffolding, YeovilElite Scaffolding – a family-owned business that is part of the Denholm Group, reached out to Jobcentre Plus in a bid to reach younger potential employees looking for an apprenticeship.#We initially approached the jobcentre, simply for advice and to askthey could place an ad on their system. We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year. Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing on the placement.

The UN veried that production had been eradicated in most of the country.But after their removal in , farmers in many parts of the country reportedly ploughed over their wheat fields — which had been almostimpossible to bring to market because of the lack of roads and infrastructure — and ed to poppy production.During the last years of the Taliban rule, wheat was rotting in fields because the farmers were unable to bring it to market to be sold and ground into flour.Poppies are the main source of income for millions of small farmers and day labourers who can earn upwards of  US dollarsa month harvesting them and extracting the opium.Today, Afghanistan is the world’s largest producer of opium and in , before the Taliban takeover, produced more than , tons of opium, which a report from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime said could potentially yield  tons of pure heroin.Afghanistan produces more opium than all opium-producing countries combined and last year was the sixth straight year of record opium harvests. vw,vw,px, px\"The ban on poppy production will further impoverish the country’s poorest citizens This is the case even as the US and international community spends billions of dollars to eradicate poppy production.The Taliban reportedly made millions of dollars charging taxes on farmers and middlemen to move their drugs outside Afghanistan and senior officials of the US-backed government were implicated in the flourishing drug trade.Washington spent more than eight billion US dollarstrying to eradicate poppy production in Afghanistan during its nearly -year war, which ended with theof the Taliban in August.Nearly % of heroin produced from Afghan opium production reaches Europe through Central Asia and Pakistan.In Afghanistan the ban on poppy production will further impoverish its poorest citizens.According to a UN report in , income from opiates in Afghanistan was . to . billion US dollars , more than % of the country’s GDP.The same report said “illicit drug supply chains outside Afghanistan” made much more.The Taliban’s ban comes as the country faces a humanitarian crisis that prompted the UN to ask for . billion US dollarslast month as % of Afghans do not have enough to eat.The ban, while hitting drug production houses hard, will be likely to devastate the small farmer who relies on opium production to survive.It is dficult to know how the Taliban rulers will be able to create substitute crops and financing for Afghanistan’s farmers as their economy is in free fall and international development money has stopped.Poppy production and income are often used as a form of banking among Afghanistan’s poorest who use the promise of the next year’s harvest to buy staples such as flour, sugar, cooking oil and heating oil.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid announced the ban at a news conference in the capital."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-287-april-2-wordle-word-hints-todays-answer  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

To me, that is the greatest challenge,” he said. “There is work that needs to be done in the North, cross-community.We need to encourage those communities whose pattern of school completion is poor, encourage them to work in a really targeted way to get the kids to finish school.“It doesn’t have to be the standard curriculum, it could be apprenticeships, it could be training, but that there are levels of achievement that can be certied and a sense of completion and progression. That is the most important thing to bring those who feel marginalised in from the periphery.“It is one of my regrets that both governments and the Executive haven’t tackled that issue in a Marshall Plan way, because it would be transformativewe did.”The Marshall Plan was a huge US-backed financial project which helped rebuild parts of Europe following World War II.Dr Ciara Fitzpatrick said the failure to tackle educational disadvantage has a “strong correlation” to the “continued failure” to tackle poverty issues.“It is absolutely inexcusable that one in four children in our classrooms are living in poverty,” she said. “This figure is likely to rocket, due to the cost of living crisis.Thousands of families are expected to fall into a spiral of destitution. This means that they will be unable to afford food, heat, electricity and products to maintain basic hygiene.These essentials ensure a bare minimum standard of living and dignity. How can children participate in educationthey are cold, hungry and don’t have the equipment they need “Last week I heard of a young boy who didn’t attend school because his family could not afford to buy him suitable shoes. This is where we are at, and it’s only going to get worse.”The Ulster University lecturer criticised the response of Stormont in tackling poverty-related issues.“In leaving the Executive just as the cost of living crisis really began to bite, the DUP chose to inflict great suffering on those with the lowest incomes. It’s hugely frustrating that £m which was allocated from HM Treasury to deal with the unfolding crisis is held hostage, due to the lack of an Executive.“I feel like there has never been a time where we need decisive leadership more than now. Without brave and bold policy-making the repercussions will be extensive.We will see educational standards for those in areas of deprivation decline even further. Mental and physical health problems will be even more common, and our social care systems will be beyond breaking point.”Professor Tony Gallagher, a professor of education at Queen’s University, said the link between social disadvantage and educational outcomes has been a “persistent problem” in Northern Ireland and affects young people from all communities.“All political parties in the North have committed to an action plan to address this — but the focus is largely on the early years and its benefits will emerge in the longer term,” said Professor Gallagher.“The Taoiseach’s focus on greater flexibility and creativity in supporting young people to gain meaningful employment is important and much more could be done in this area.“Every young person deserves to complete their time in education with the skills, attributes and qualications which will allow them to live a fulfilled le as a citizen.At the moment, this is not the experience of far too many young people in Northern Ireland.”Most ReadCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveFormer RTÉ and BBC football pundit arrested after being found passed out in car with children in the backBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter PlayVideo: CCTV captures the chilling moment Gareth Hutch is murdered - Warning, distressing scenesLatest EducationJon TongeOpinionUniversities fail to make the grade on tackling outdated traditionsViewpointOpinionIntegrated schools failure shames NINI schools facing drop in psychological support servicesNorthern Ireland schools are ‘too afraid’ to promote Covid jabs‘A good day for fairness and equality’ as Bill to end religious discrimination in recruitment of teachers is passedLatestDover roads ‘free flowing’ for tourists again after travel chaos near portCovid- puts temporary stop on Daniel Craig’sto BroadwayEmergency budget needed from Government amid cost-of-living crisis – McDonaldMore than  arrests made at climate change protestsCeltic stretch lead over Rangers as Cameron Carter-Vickers earns Old Firm win,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The window remains in place today.Neither Mr Craig nor his sisters ever married, and they are understood to have remained living together at the family home until his death in June , aged in his mid s.A report in the Ballymena Observer newspaper on October , , outlined details of Mr Craig’s will.According to the report, he left a block of five shops at Church Street in Ballymena and other property and land in the town to his two sisters, along with the house in Belfast.He also left £, for the upkeep of the window at Fisherwick Church.The will stated that the remainder of Mr Craig’s estate was to be donated to the Presbyterian Church in Ireland to set up a fund called the “The Frank McCaughey Craig and Sarah Remington Charles Trust” in honour of his parents.Mr Craig requested that the fund be used to augment the “salary and stipend of clergymen who are not paid the minimum of £ a year”.However, he stressed that this was not to include “assistants or retired ministers”.The newspaper report added: “An official at Church House, Belfast, said that they had known for some time that a substantial bequest was likely. Final details were not yet available, but it was estimated that, after several bequests and other questions had been settled, the sum would be around £,.”Tragically, according to the newspaper report, Hester Craig died a few days after her brother.

The SDLP#s MP for the area, Claire Hanna, who romped home in the last general election with some , votes, around , more than the nearest candidate — expressed her shock at the turn of events. The constituency is also larger than East and West Belfast and is the most erse of all NI#s electoral areas, ing MLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens. There is a term for this move by Sinn Fein we are all too familiar with: gerrymandering.What is most curious about this move is that, back in , proposed changes to electoral boundaries here that would seemingly have favoured the DUP were branded “gerrymandering to placate” Northern Ireland#s largest unionist party by Sinn Fein. This criticism was not voiced by one Sinn Fein representative or party spokesperson at the time, but at least half a dozen, in what was essentially a media blitz in a bid to put a spanner in the proposals.What is even more curious is that press statements on Sinn Fein#s website referring to said gerrymandering have vanished. If you simply google “Sinn Fein on gerrymandering” and click on any of the ious links which previously directed to statements from Conor Murphy, Colm Gildernew, Francie Molloy and others on the Sinn Fein website, you are greeted with the following  error message, reading: “We#re sorry, but the page you requested could not be found on our servers. We may have recently moved, renamed, or deleted certain pages.”It seems, much like the party#s previous stance on Russia, they are simply trying to avoid accusations of double standards and prone to extreme stance-switching when it suits them.Read MoreSinn Fein defend proposals to redraw Belfast’s electoral boundariesAn April Fool’s wish listDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ah, April Fool#s Day. Given the state of world at the minute — war in Europe, the cost of living crisis on the tail end of a pandemic that hasn#t gone away - I was hoping we would give it a rest this year, lest we cause more unneeded distress. One humorous political wish list, however, was posted on Twitter by human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights , reading: “‘Stick your hostile environment’ — Givan tells UK Home Office. ‘Mackies will be % social’ — Hargey takes action on housing rights. ‘Our policies are the problem, not you’ — Swann promises counsellors in every GP practice.” We can but dream.NI#s most unambiguous partyAn interesting press statement was released by the TUV on Friday, which declared that the party#s designation on the ballot paper for May#s poll will read: ‘TUV — No Sea Border’.Explaining the move, TUV leader Jim Allister said: “Having led where others have followed we wish every voter to see the issue identied without ambiguity on the ballot paper. There will be no doubt as to what a vote for TUV means.”Now, the TUV have been accused of being many things, but ‘ambiguous’ is definitely not one of them. Anyone with even a slight grasp of Northern Ireland politics could probably predict the party’s stance on any given issue before Jim Allister’s party has voiced its opinion. So this just seems like a needless waste of ink. I doubt anyone was going to be mistaken that they were actually voting for a bunch of liberal Europhiles.Related topicsSinn FéinSDLPConor MurphyClaire HannaMore On Sinn Féin PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slurs PremiumPoles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ value PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border poll PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseMost ReadCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveFormer RTÉ and BBC football pundit arrested after being found passed out in car with children in the backBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeLatestChancellor always looking at how  he can help with rising costs – ShappsDover roads ‘free flowing’ for tourists again after travel chaos near portCovid- puts temporary stop on Daniel Craig’sto BroadwayEmergency budget needed from Government amid cost-of-living crisis – McDonaldMore than  arrests made at climate change protests,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit :Sinn FeinGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA victims’ campaigner has questioned the use of the Europa Hotel as the setting for Sinn Fein’s election launch, saying it’s a venue the Provisional IRA “systematically bombed”.On Tuesday, Michelle O’Neill gave a speech at the Great Victoria Street hotel, which was bombed  times during the Troubles.She outlined Sinn Fein’s priorities ahead of the upcoming election including the cost of living crisis and “fiercely defending” the Good Friday Agreement.“The facts are that the balance of power at Stormont has shted irreversibly and political unionism must come to terms with the fact the world is moving on fast,” Ms O’Neill said.“So, while the DUP and the TUV are trying to take us backwards, our message is clear, we are only moving forward.”Commenting on the choice of venue, Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United said: Sinn Fein clearly don#t do irony, to bleat on about upholding democracy at the very venue which the Provisional IRA systematically attacked again and again, making it the most bombed hotel in Europe is brazen to say the least.However, due to the intensity of the Provisional IRA#s bombing campaign — and that of other terrorists, few hotel venues across Northern Ireland have come away unscathed by the Troubles.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up TUV South Belfast candidate Andrew Girvin said Sinn Fein’s campaign launch at the Europa was a “grotesque spectacle” given the setting.“Here we had the political wing of the terrorist organisation which repeatedly bombed the hotel in which they met daring to ponticate about democracy and respecting the will of the people.“There is nothing undemocratic about refusing to operate the Belfast Agreement structures which could foist a Sinn Fein First Minister upon Northern Ireland.“The choice of venue for this republican jamboree underscores the fact that no unionist should ever agree to take up the position of deputy to a Sinn Fein First Minister.“Yet just weeks out from the election both the DUP and UUP are dodging this vital question.Will they act as bridesmaid to Michelle O#Neill  Why is there reluctance to be open and honest with the public on this point ”The DUP#s Gordon Lyons said Sinn Fein#s election launch demonstrates their priority lies on holding a border poll rather than on helping families or rebuilding Northern Ireland’s economy.The party#s director of elections said: Sinn Fein#s rally was a show of strength for a border poll.“Whilst the DUP has a five-point plan to build a better future for Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein wants to win the election to implement their plan for a border poll.“There is a clear choice on offer to people whether they want a future focused on fixing our health system, tackling the cost of living crisis and replacing the protocol, or one fixated on a isive border poll.“When Michelle O#Neill talks about making history, we know it isn#t record levels of investment into our hospitals she is referring to. Now is not the time for ision and uncertainty.That is why this election is so important.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.Speaking at an election launch, Ms O’Neill said that Sinn Fein will defend but not renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement.The former Deputy First Minister said those who hanker for the past need to realise that there is no going back, only forward.Sinn Fein#s Stormont leader also described the DUP#s collapse of the Executive as political vandalism, although her own party also brought Stormont down in the same Assembly mandate.She said: When the Assembly, Executive and North South Ministerial Council were restored in January  it was with a shared commitment to deliver the public services, societal reforms and future that our people need and deserve.It was ambitious to form a five-party coalition Executive, but it was achieved, getting us back to genuine power-sharing, and thankfully so, because while everyone knew there would be challenges ahead, no one could have predicted that in only a matter of weeks that our Executive would be dealing with a global pandemic that would have such devastating impacts on every part of society, community and people#s lives and livelihoods.It is to the credit of all ministers from across the five parties that they responded and have worked with a unity of purpose, and unity of leadership for the past two years.This is what the public want to see more of — co-operation and delivery.Ms O#Neill added: Sinn Fein will be defending, not renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement now, or in the time ahead.Ms O#Neill said the May  election was the most important in a generation.Related topicsSinn FéinMichelle O#NeillIRACost of LivingTraditional Unionist VoiceGordon LyonsThe Executive OfficeMore On Sinn Féin PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slurs PremiumPoles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ value PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border pollAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyMost ReadCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveFormer RTÉ and BBC football pundit arrested after being found passed out in car with children in the backBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismLatestDUP and Sinn Fein trade claims over election prioritiesTiger Woods to make ‘game-time decision’ on Masters participationChancellor always looking at how  he can help with rising costs – ShappsDover roads ‘free flowing’ for tourists again after travel chaos near portCovid- puts temporary stop on Daniel Craig’sto Broadway,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Brian Lawless PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe UUP manesto has enough meat to show that the party is starting to think seriously about being a major player in the Executive once more, and enough bare bones to reveal that the process is incomplete.At , words, this document is serious in its scope and suffused with the liberal unionist tone of new leader Doug Beattie.But it is what this manesto does not say which reveals most: hard choices or unpopular proposals are either absent or presented in oblique terms — and that jars with Mr Beattie’s straight-talking style.Health is the first and the iest section — unsurprisingly, given that polling has shown Robin Swann to be Stormont’s most popular minister.The manesto indicates support for radical measures, saying that the pandemic has shown that both patients and medics are willing “to travel longer distancesit means receiving care and support in a more timely manner.

There can be no border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.That simple commitment seems to prevent the UUP signing up to any revised protocol involving an Irish Sea border.Its tone is dferent to the DUP, talking about wanting to “maintain good relations with the EU”, but the content is similar to that of the ERG — pushing mutual enforcement, with a new north-south body to oversee this. A requirement to label GB goods coming into NI “for UK sale only” would only avoid a new Irish Sea borderit was enforced for all UK products.The party would ban gay conversion therapy, establish a gambling regulator, allocate overdue investment to football stadia, and examine letting private garages do MoT tests.The party opposes a Troubles amnesty and robustly says paramilitaries “need to be put out of business permanently” by focussing on their leaderships and criminal assets. It wants to curb legal aid, due to “the culture of lawfare which has been allowed to develop within our legal system and which has proved extremely lucrative for a number of firms”.The manesto is laden with more spending — new train stops, new busses, new roads, more rates relief for some businesses, spending on city deals,  more police officers, and looking at giving everyone in primary school a free meal.How this would be paid for is unclear. There is no talk of increasing rates. Water charges are ruled out. And giving Stormont more tax powers is also rejected. Changing the status of NI Waterand the Housing Executive to allow them to borrow is about as far as funding proposals go.This is a detailed document, yet many of the proposals are all things to all people – it is pro-business, but also pro-worker pro-grammar schools, but looking to review how academic selection operates, pro-EU, but anti-protocol.None of those things are necessarily contradictory, but in not being clearer about some of the most controversial or unpopular areas, the party is putting off having to take those decisions until after they’ve got the votes.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyDoug BeattieThe Executive OfficeRobin SwannNI ProtocolMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudge PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idleCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body find PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismMost ReadCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveFormer RTÉ and BBC football pundit arrested after being found passed out in car with children in the backBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeLatestChancellor always looking at how  he can help with rising costs – ShappsDover roads ‘free flowing’ for tourists again after travel chaos near portCovid- puts temporary stop on Daniel Craig’sto BroadwayEmergency budget needed from Government amid cost-of-living crisis – McDonaldMore than  arrests made at climate change protests,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueGrant Shapps said the Chancellor has provided ‘billions and billions’ to help tackle the cost-of-living crisis By Amy Gibbons, PA Political CorrespondentApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Chancellor will always be looking at what  he can do to support people, a Cabinet minister said as he faced questions over the Government’s handling of the cost-of-living crisis.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps insisted Rishi Sunak has “already provided billions and billions of pounds to try to relieve the pressure”.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has lambasted the Government for what he claims are “pathetic” attempts to ease the burden on people struggling with rising bills.That sentiment was echoed by shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds, who said on Sunday he is “angry” at the scale of the crisis, arguing that ministers have not done enough to tackle the problem.I want to absolutely be clear, given the Chancellor’s record, I’m sure he’ll always be looking what  he can doGrant Shapps, Transport SecretaryHe told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme that the Government’s proposals for investing in nuclear energy should not be used as a “smokescreen” to obscure the “real issue” at hand.“Whatever the long-term energy strategy the Government will unveil, it can’t get away from the fact they’ve got to take some action now to help people,” he said.Asked about the cost-of-living crisis, Mr Shapps told the same programme: “We’re trying to do what we can – you’re askingwe’ll do more – I want to absolutely be clear, given the Chancellor’s record, I’m sure he’ll always be looking what  he can do.“He’s already provided billions and billions of pounds to try to relieve the

interviews on Sunday that the way poverty data is presented can be “somewhat misleading”.Put to him that hundreds of thousands more children are being pushed into poverty, he told Sophy Ridge: “I don’t want to sort of get us lost in numbers here, but poverty is ided into both absolute and relative , and sometimes the way it’s presented can be somewhat misleading to say the least.”The

And that’s why the Chancellor’s already come forward with £ billion.”Speaking to Sunday Morning, Mr Reynolds criticised what he deemed to be a lack of action from ministers to tackle rising living costs.“I sit here this morning and I feel angry at the scale of the crisis people in this country are facing and the lack of response from Government in the spring statement – and promises on announcements in future just won’t cut it,” he said.Referring to the Government’s upcoming energy security strategy, he said: “The energy statement… will deal with long-term issues of supply, I understand it, it will not be about help now, and the Government has to understand the scale of this crisis.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St

the town.ldquoAn investment appraisal has recently been carried out by the Department of Education to consider how best to meet the long-term needs of the pupils at St Malachyrsquos and this has come out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead and his predecessor as Education Minister, Dr Brian Mawhinney.ldquoThe school definitely requires additional accommodation and I am keen that is is provided on the existing site, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who has compiled a report on underway drinking which is to be presented to Down Council.KILLYLEAGH ndash The town of Killyleagh is set for a financial boost to help revive its economic, commercial and environmental appearance, it has been revealed.A preliminary application has been made to the International Fund for a core project to help trigger a revival in the townrsquos fortunes.And by the end of the year, plans to designate the town as a conservation area will be completed.The investment in Killyleaghrsquos future was revealed when the chairman of Down District Council, Mr Sean Quinn, officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, told the launch gathering that he has been delighted to assist the committee towards its goals of reviving the town.Mr McGrady said Killyleagh had recognised that it was very much an era of self-help.He looked forward to the day when Killyleagh is selected as the site for the Strangford Lough Liaison Office and is designated as the Gateway to Strangford Lough, fulfilling its tourist potential.LEITRIM ndash An  month battle to have a Leitrim footpath declared a right of way has found its way to Westminster.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has been asked to investigate Banbridge Councilrsquos handling of the matter after more than  people signed a petition asking for the adoption of the footpath as a right-of-way.The footpath, which is marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people.

While chatting with clients remains at the heart of what we do to support those who are isolated, we now find ourselves helping people with a range of complex needs.ldquoThe charityrsquos work has evolved and I suppose it will continue to in the future, but Good Morningrsquos Down core principle will always remain the same.Linda paid tribute to all the charityrsquos staff and those who have supported the organisation over many years.ldquoWe are like family and I will be sorry to leave, she said. ldquoI have spent a large part of my working le with Good Morning Down and have literally lived and breathed the organisation and have been assisted by great people.Linda said it was ldquotremendous to meet clients when the charity organised its get-togethers and while these were put on hold due to the pandemic, she hopes there may be an opportunity do something before the end of the year.ldquoThat of course will be guided by the public health situation at the time as we are mindful that our clients are elderly, with a number of them also vulnerable.Linda said the charityrsquos service has never been more important and while she is leaving the organisation, she knows it will continue to be a key part of peoplersquos lives.She added: ldquoI really enjoyed my time with Good Morning Down and worked alongside really great people. They were the friendly voice at the end of the telephone who helped make a dference to peoplersquos lives.ldquoFor many, their chat with our volunteers was the only interaction they would have with others during the day and we were always conscious of that. We worked to make a dference and you build a special relationship with clients which is why it was so wonderful to see them when we all did meet up.As Linda prepares to say her final goodbyes, Good Morning Down is looking for someone to replace her at the helm of the charity.Anyone keen to take on taking on her role or interested in getting involved in the work of Good Morning Down is asked to contact her on    or email lindabakergmd@yahoo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"History project looks back at  Jewish family’s links to Shrigley  ","story":"THE remarkable contribution of Jewish families in saving Shrigley has been recalled in a unique history project.The story of how Jews, fleeing the Holocaust and Hitlers murderous purge in Europe, started arriving in the village just before the start of the Second World War and helped transform the fortunes of villagers after the Hungry Thirties is largely forgotten.But more than  years later, Shrigleys legacy is featuring in an on-line interactive map telling the stories of Jewish families who have left a lasting impact on Northern Ireland.Steven Jaffe has been researching the heritage of the Jewish community across Northern Ireland.ldquoThe goal of the Belfast Jewish Heritage project Shared History fund is to locate, preserve, document and make publicly available material relating to the Jewish community in Northern Ireland, said Mr Jaffe.ldquoIt shows  sites across Northern Ireland, including Shrigley, Saintfield and Downpatrick.

Villagers had suffered from the awful impact of the Hungry Thirties in one of the most socially deprived regions of the UK after the closure of the village spinning mill in .By November  United Chrome Tanners were employing  people tanning sheep skins and cattle hides for shoes, handbags and clothing.Within less than  years they were a world leader, employing more than  people and under the leadership of Erik Utitz became the first NI winners of the Queens award for exports.Leather tanning eventually died out in the village in .Details of the Jewish project, which received funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, can be found at this website: www.belfastjewishheritage.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Lawyer eyeing SDLP result in Strangford  ","story":"CONOR Houston is hoping to become Strangfordrsquos first SDLP Assemblyman when voters go to the polls on May .A lawyer and civic activist, he is going head-to-head against the DUP, UUP and Alliance who currently hold the constituencyrsquos five seats and as the parties ramp up their respective election campaigns, Mr Houston has outlined why he decided to put his name forward.He said he has been very fortunate to have had a lot of great opportunities throughout his career and wants to bring the experiences he has to make a positive impact on the people in Strangford.Mr Houston said while he has never been in politics before, there have been a few moments in his career that he believes shaped him for political le.ldquoAs a lawyer, I fought against unfairness and injustice, he continued. ldquoOne of the most frustrating things was seeing young people end up in the criminal justice system.ldquoSo many of them came from situations of poverty, abuse, addiction and been failed by our education and care systems.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

Many of the people who make this point themselves care very much about the Irish Sea border — they want to keep it, either because they support staying in the EU , or because they see it as major step towards an economic united Ireland, and thus towards a more general all-Ireland.It is true that many of the more apolitical unionists are much more relaxed about the protocol than they should be, but that is typically because it is complex .It is also because such unionists heard that the protocol offered the best of both worlds .Thus unionists should have been, and should still be, trying to explain and reiterate to some of the more apathetic pro Union voters the ultimate impact of the NI Protocol. This would entail trying to revive some of the spirit of indignation that there was in the early months of , when many people across the Province were suddenly finding that they could not get deliveries from Great Britain that they had always been able to get before.The EU has been keen to agree to case-by-case exemptions to checks in part because it does not want the wider public to be troubled by the protocol. Needless to say, therefore, unionists badly need to see a large vote for parties that oppose the protocol.Doug Beattie’s approach to the Irish Sea border, of opposing it but calling for engagement in the pursuit of political solutions to the problems that it creates, has a high-wire quality. If the Alliance vote goes down, even slightly, on recent elections, and the Ulster Unionist Party vote increases, Mr Beattie will be able to say that his tactics have stemmed the decline of unionism by broadening its appeal.If Alliance continues upwards, and the UUP does not rise, he will be seen to have not only been weak on the protocol, but having failed to win over moderates in the process.l The second key thing to watch out for in the election is turnoutThere was a time in the s and early s when it seemed voters in the western world were losing interest in politics.Countries such as the UK and United States were increasingly wealthy and many bitter political disagreements of the s and s seemed to give way to a more bland, moderate politics. In Northern Ireland itself, this wider trend towards consensus seemed to be reflected in the  Belfast Agreement. But this sense of stable politics has evaporated, at home and abroad. There are now bitter ides on major issues of national and global importance, and much turbulence in voting patterns.The Brexit referendum of  had a higher turnoutthan most recent UK general elections have done.The Scottish independence plebiscite in  had an even higher turnout .The fiercely contested, and narrowly decided, US presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in November  had one of the highest turnouts of any presidential race in modern memory .In Northern Ireland, the turnout surged from % of voters in the  Stormont election to % a year later, in the more fraught atmosphere of the election after Sinn Fein collapsed the institutions.There is now keen interest in conflicts and politics at home and abroad. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, I feared people in the UK would not care much, seeing it as a distant problem. I was relieved to be proven wrong by the massive interest there was in such a serious global matter.A high turnout next month would show that the population in NI still think that Stormont and issues such as the protocol matter.l The final thing to watch is the vote shares of the two communitiesWill it be like the  general election, when the DUP and Sinn Fein dominated thingsor like  when they plunged to a combined % Will unionists get a combined vote share in the high s %, as in the  and  Stormont elections, or will they be down round %, as in  Westminster  Will nationalists combined get more than % of the vote, as they have done in some elections, or go back under that level It will be a bad day indeed for unionismthe combined vote is as low as %, as some polls have suggested, or even in the high s.ProtocolNorthern IrelandDoug BeattieBen LowryIrish Sea  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘TUV - No Sea Border’ given approval for ballot papers‘SF wants to sleepwalk other parties into border poll plan’Lough Neagh is shrinking and could be gone by In Pictures - The official opening of the Royal Black Institution state-of-the-art headquarters in LoughgallBen Lowry: Three things to watch out for in the coming Stormont electionMost PopularBest patio heaters UK : weatherproof electric heaters and coal firepits, from Made, Wayfair, ConranBest air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep you comfy from Outwell, Vango, and SnugpakBest bread makers - tried and tested, from Panasonic, Morphy Richards, and LakelandBike helmets UK : Eight best cycling helmets for womenBest men’s waterproof hiking trousers UK : walking trousers from Craghoppers, Berghaus, Montane, Salomon                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It tramples on unionism. It’s promise of consent was a lie.” If this was not evident before the protocol was imposed on us, then it sure is now. Unionists who voted for the Belfast Agreement were sold a big fat pup by our so-called leaders.The pup has grown up now and it’s very evident it doesn’t like us.Harry Patterson, CastlecaulfieldFor more political news, click here:WATCH: Crowd cheers for the destruction of the  Belfast Agreement at loyalist rally RALLY BREAKDOWN: All the upcoming parades and protests against the Northern Ireland Brexit Protocol——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Your commitment and dedication has been truly remarkable. This was a team effort and it has been a huge honour to be involved.“From the outset we have known that every jab counts and it is thanks to you that there have been many lives saved, and far, far fewer people seriously ill in hospital due to covid. You should be very proud of the role you have played.”Speaking to the public, Ms Donnelly said: “Thank you for rolling up your sleeves and helping to protect yourselves and those around you from this terrible disease. However we’re not at the finish line just yet. I’ve made plenty of appeals to the public in the past  months but I’m sure I’ll be forgiven for one more - please come forward for your jabs.“It’s vital that everyone in the  plus age group and those who have severely weakened immune systems come forward for their spring booster. I would again encourage everyone who is eligible for their booster to get it without delay. Vaccination clinics are still running across Northern Ireland and people are still coming forward for boosters as well as first and second doses. It’s not too late to get protected.”Patricia was a clinical psychologist by profession and held a number of key positions at Trust level before retiring.

Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann says that testing will continue to play a vital role in Northern Ireland’s response to COVID- over the coming months but that a “more targeted approach” will be introduced on a phased basis from April, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness.Under the new policy, PCR testing in NI will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop Covid symptoms.Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting, such as a care home, until the end of June, with a further review then.The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced in Northern Ireland until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June.The full range of changes to take effect from  April in Northern Ireland are as follows-* PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.* Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.* Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.* Routine asymptomatic testing - testing for those with no symptoms - will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.* Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.* Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.* Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.* Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .* Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.”The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Continue with six weeks holiday in the summer at least! We get the shortest summer break in the world. State should provide free affordable childcare.”Trena Wise said: “Four weeks would be better and spread the rest throughout the year.” This was agreed with by Lisa Gerrard.Trudi Thomas said: “Five weeks and an extra week off at Christmas.”Iulia Condurache said: “These kids need this. Where is this obsession to work more is coming from  School is enough, work week is too much. Cut the bloody huge pays, tax the rich properly, educate for sustainability not waste and you will have a balance.”MORE NEWS:Kelly Crowther said: “No. By moving the extra leave to October and December is going to cost me so much more to entertain the kids. At least in the summer we can hopefully enjoy the sunshine and free stuff as parks and beaches.”Lynne Bryan said: “Yes definitely they get to many holidays as it is.”Luna Davies said: “Perhaps four weeks but the last week of school is turned over to fun activities without academic focus. Add the other week in to Christmas. If it comes after Christmas, the kids should have enough to do to entertain themselves.”Paula Chapman said: “Id rather four weeks to be honest.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt seems over the years, Barry Island seems to be the shining light of identity for the Barry and District.However, many times have I been asked this, \"Karl-James Langford, was Barry Island ever an island \"Well, I could ignore the question and reply in a sarcastic way, but one, never does. For when you look at the area today, it is dficult to think of a time when Barry Island was just that an island surrounded by water at hightide.For after  for all those dams, and bridges built across The Sound, slowly dragged Barry Island to the mainland. The water logged landscape has now been lost within a landscape of housing and other development.Barry Island until  was nothing more than a place lost in time with a rundown farmhouse, outbuildings and forgotten about sacred wells until things changed. Francis Crawshay purchased Barry Island in  a very eccentric man, who saw that his new home The Marine Hotel, was to accommodate friends visiting him on the Island.You may add that the image we examine today is of a dferent structure. The original Marine Hotel of Francis Crawshay building on the start of Friars Point, was eventually renamed Friars Point House, at which point the original name became redundant. However, as Barry Island became a focal point of day trippers, and visits for those building the dock, accommodation was required.Now, towards the end of the s, the Barry and District saw the construction of a number of Hotels, and  of which, after being opened never received the licences for the purpose they were built, such as the Sea View Hotel on Dock View Road, which became the Sea View Labour Club.One of these new purpose-built hotels one of which was on Barry Island, however opened in , and adopted the name The Marine Hotel, as it was no longer being used for the grand building Friars Point. The Marine Hotel on the corner of Plymouth Road and Friars Point, was infact a much larger building than you can find today alas some parts of it were demolished over the past few decades. However, what building still remains although it is now been converted into flats, is still impressive..removeBack in the day, in the late s you entered through a very impressive Portico entrance, with stone details picked out in Portland stone. The rest of the structure utilising locally sourced Red brick. The Marine Hotel was the place to stay on Barry Island, with an array of fine rooms to stay it, after a long summer evening eating icecream on the sands of the Bay, oryou had been visiting the Barry and District on business.Now when viewing the building facing onto Friars Road, the scroll work surrounding the lettering entrapping the words  MARINE HOTEL. This is an echo of times when we built in a much grander way. Most of the buildings of note were built to last in the late s, in such a way the Marine Hotel was constructed.One thing of final note is that one local resident told me story that The Marine Hotel was a haunt of Leguards and Coastguards from Barry Island. And then ironically inquests were held into deaths caused to drowning, and other reasons at the Marine Hotel also.Many thanks for joining us this week. More from our enigmatic Barry and District next week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe order warns farmers that their crops will be burned and they can be jailedthey proceed with the harvest.The ban is reminiscent of the Taliban’s previous rule in the late s when they outlawed poppy production. vw,vw,px, px\"Afghan farmers harvest poppy in Nad Ali district in Helmand province At that time, the ban was staggered and implemented countrywide within two years. The UN veried that production had been eradicated in most of the country.But after their removal in , farmers in many parts of the country reportedly ploughed over their wheat fields — which had been almostimpossible to bring to market because of the lack of roads and infrastructure — and ed to poppy production.During the last years of the Taliban rule, wheat was rotting in fields because the farmers were unable to bring it to market to be sold and ground into flour.Poppies are the main source of income for millions of small farmers and day labourers who can earn upwards of  US dollarsa month harvesting them and extracting the opium.Today, Afghanistan is the world’s largest producer of opium and in , before the Taliban takeover, produced more than , tons of opium, which a report from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime said could potentially yield  tons of pure heroin.Afghanistan produces more opium than all opium-producing countries combined and last year was the sixth straight year of record opium harvests. vw,vw,px, px\"The ban on poppy production will further impoverish the country’s poorest citizens This is the case even as the US and international community spends billions of dollars to eradicate poppy production.The Taliban reportedly made millions of dollars charging taxes on farmers and middlemen to move their drugs outside Afghanistan and senior officials of the US-backed government were implicated in the flourishing drug trade..removeWashington spent more than eight billion US dollarstrying to eradicate poppy production in Afghanistan during its nearly -year war, which ended with theof the Taliban in August.Nearly % of heroin produced from Afghan opium production reaches Europe through Central Asia and Pakistan.In Afghanistan the ban on poppy production will further impoverish its poorest citizens.According to a UN report in , income from opiates in Afghanistan was . to . billion US dollars , more than % of the country’s GDP.The same report said “illicit drug supply chains outside Afghanistan” made much more.The Taliban’s ban comes as the country faces a humanitarian crisis that prompted the UN to ask for . billion US dollarslast month as % of Afghans do not have enough to eat.The ban, while hitting drug production houses hard, will be likely to devastate the small farmer who relies on opium production to survive.It is dficult to know how the Taliban rulers will be able to create substitute crops and financing for Afghanistan’s farmers as their economy is in free fall and international development money has stopped.Poppy production and income are often used as a form of banking among Afghanistan’s poorest who use the promise of the next year’s harvest to buy staples such as flour, sugar, cooking oil and heating oil.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid announced the ban at a news conference in the capital..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Taliban announces ban on poppy production in Afghanistan article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Their creative and inspirational designs will help create a good first impression among international visitors coming to the area to experience the Game of Thrones Studio Tour.“I am looking forward to seeing further regeneration work get underway in Banbridge as part of our Arrivals Project - all of which will create a high quality environment and support the town’s long-term economic and social prosperity.” Irish-Singaporean illustrator and muralist Holly Pereira was inspired by the area’s unique connection to the Brontë family. Her hand-painted ‘Welcome to Banbridge’ mural in Newry Street celebrates the Brontë link to the area using typography inspired by the world’s most famous literary family.Artist Friz pays homage to the town’s most famous landmark and Europe’s first ever flyover, Downshire Bridge. The mural of Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton at Bridge Street. Picture: Edward Byrne PhotographyHer mural in Downshire Place depicts an old woman who used to sell apples on the bridge and jingle the money in her pocket, giving it the affectionate local nickname Jingler’s Bridge. Inspired by the area’s linen history, Rob Hilken’s mural at Linenhall Street depicts damask linen with a Jacquard weaving pattern that was created by local linen mills. The chrysanthemum damask design used was created by William Liddell and incorporates the distinctive pattern found on Jacquard loom punch cards, which were used to create the complex damask designs that made the Banbridge area world-famous for its linen.Belfast-based artist and illustrator FGB’smural at Bridge Street celebrates the town’s association to Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton who was educated at Banbridge Academy Preparatory School. Friz at Downshire Place. Picture: Edward Byrne PhotographyHe won the  Nobel Prize in Physics for his pioneering work on splitting the atom nucleus. Dublin-based Decoy’s mural at Scarva Street celebrates Banbridge as a strategic river crossing point, a communication route between Belfast and Dublin and a focus for agricultural industry, trade and commerce. An ancient king’s road connecting Ulster to the rest of the island once crossed the Bann at a forging place a short distance downstream at Ballykeel.In addition to the new street art, one of Banbridge’s most iconic landmarks - a B-listed monument dedicated to Captain Crozier which memorialises his contribution to polar exploration - has undergone signicant restoration work.Holly Pereira on Newry Street.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":" pictures of historic day as royal black institution opens new headquarters ","story":"Roy Reynolds: Rathcoole murder victim suffered ‘barbaric injuries’, court told   Murder suspect arrested after PSNI stop car on dual-carriagewayNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeopleThe grand opening of the headquarters was officially declared open by Sovereign Grand Master Rev William Anderson.

With his ear for a good story and eye for detail, Jack, who founded the historical group in , takes readers on a mirthful trip down memory lane.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They gradually gained popularity with the audience and, being held on the Monday night before the annual May Fair Day, reflected the atmosphere of jollication that pervaded the town at this special time of year.An eye-catching image from Ballyclare.“The music was provided by ious groups of instrumentalists – fiddlers, accordionists, tin whistle players – and their sessions were interspersed with songs, recitations and stories by local inidual entertainers drawn from the lore and culture of the Six Mile Water region. Many of these songs and much of the material came from an oral tradition and few were available in written form.”Verses of material from local ‘balladeers’ Ernie Scott, Sandy Robinson, Jock Gilmour and Matt Meharg together with short biographical details of these and many others feature in the pages of the book.Jack continued: “Sadly the concerts came to an end when the security situation dictated that crowds gathering in halls became impossible. The Historical Society planned to celebrate the th anniversary of the founding of the society in  by reviving the Rhymes and Ructions concert in  but the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put paid to their plans.”In his introduction to Rhyme and Ructions Jack, who is the author of a number of local history studies including ‘Stories of a Letime’, also reveals what inspired this latest publication.Author Jack McKinney with his latest publication.“What I am endeavouring to do here is to compile a collection of the ballads and anecdotes that proved so popular at the concerts. The tone and subjects of the ballads y considerably from the amusing to those of a more contemplative nature. As for their credibility I leave the readers to assess this for themselves.”Jack has pursued his interest in local history and its characters with zeal since retiring in  after a four-decade career as an assistant and principal teacher in east Antrim primary schools. The former Mossley Primary School pupil, taught at Abbots Cross, Ballyclare and Whitehead Primary Schools. And in the manner in which he inspired many pupils, Jack is keen to share his enthusiasm for knowledge with a whole new generation of readers.A founder member of the Ulster-Scots Language Society, Jack added: “The ballads are recorded in the style of language used in the originals – standard English or Ulster- Scots. The stories and other text may contain either or both. I have often followed the style of a mixture of Ulster -Scots and English as in the Scottish ‘Kaleyard’ novels, familiar to readers of Archibald McIlroy’s books, where the conversational dialogue of characters is in Ulster-Scots with the rest of the narrative in standard English.”The ‘Wreck of the Never Budge’, ‘Courting and Possible Consequences’ or ‘The May Fair and lots of Houzeldoo’ provide a hint of Ballyclare May Fairs past and possible inspiration for future balladeers and storytellers. As for those dogs on the front and back covers  Surely it’s worth the £. sale price to find out!
