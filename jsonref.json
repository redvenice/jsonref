But in the end, they won\u0027t be able to carry out their threats.\u0027Ministers are also facing pressure to allow face coverings to be worn in schools by some students.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has said masks for older pupils \u0027should be considered\u0027. Government guidance says face coverings are not required as pupils and staff are mixing in consistent groups.They also point out that masks are likely to have a huge impact on communication and learning. Children with hearing problems would find lip-reading impossible.But the NASUWT teachers\u0027 union wants the Department for Education to revise its guidance \u0027as a matter of urgency\u0027 to help staff return with \u0027confidence\u0027.Meanwhile, Business Secretary Alok Sharma admitted ministers were looking at local lockdowns, which could mean schools closing on a \u0027case-by-case basis\u0027.But MPs warned Britain faces \u0027economic armageddon\u0027 unless children go back to class.Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: \u0027The Government has got to recognise that there is not only one risk in the world called Covid: Economic armageddon is coming down the track.\u0027It will result in far more people dying than ever would from Covid and will see the economy going completely flat.\u0027Schools are vital to getting the economy going because unless they open, parents can\u0027t get back to work.\u0027There\u0027ll be a tsunami of unemployment if we are not careful. \u0027Ministers have got to be much clearer: Schools have got to reopen – there must be no backsliding on this.\u0027The poll of over 1,000 Mumsnet users also found that children who were able to return to school for a period before the summer break found it beneficial. Some 77 per cent said their child was happy to be back, including 94 per cent of parents of children in reception.Among parents whose children have not yet returned to school at all, 75 per cent say that supporting home learning has been stressful.Mumsnet founder and chief executive Justine Roberts said: \u0027The final third of this academic year has been astonishingly stressful for students, teachers and parents alike.\u0027It\u0027s great to see that parents are largely confident in schools\u0027 plans for coping with these strange new circumstances, and that most children who had some sort of a return to school were happy to go back.\u0027It\u0027s clear, though, that parents of pupils who face public exams next summer are wary and anxious about what will happen, given that so much teaching time has been irrevocably lost.\u0027The survey came after the Children\u0027s Commissioner for England argued schools should be kept open ahead of pubs or shops.Anne Longfield said children were \u0027an afterthought\u0027 during the first lockdown and young people must be \u0027at the heart\u0027 of tackling a resurgence of the virus. "},{"url":null,"title":"Nicola Sturgeon admits Scotlands R rate gone high one Aberdeen lockdown","story":"Share this article She also urged people contacted by the Test and Protect teams, in Aberdeen or anywhere else in Scotland, to comply with the advice they are given. Interim chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith told the briefing that Test and Protect teams in Aberdeen had established links between those who were infected with the virus and foreign travel, although he said it is not clear if this contributed to their catching the virus. He added: \u0027Just because you\u0027ve had foreign travel doesn\u0027t mean to say that this is where you contracted the infection. We\u0027ll only know the sources of each of these cases in the fullness of time.\u0027 Ms Sturgeon concluded by thanking the people of Aberdeen for their co-operation, adding: \u0027I know that this is a real blow to the city and all of us regret that we\u0027ve had to take this position, but I do believe that people understand why it is necessary. \u0027There are just too many uncertainties about this outbreak right now so we are not yet confident that we can keep it under control without these additional measures.\u0027 The First Minister also defended the contact-tracing process, following reports that some premises mentioned in the list of bars and restaurants had not been contacted by health officials. She said the Test and Protect team would make judgments on who needed to be contacted based in inidual cases, saying: \u0027I would ask people to be understanding of the complex, fast-moving nature of the situations that local public health teams are dealing with.\u0027 Ms Sturgeon said the reproduction rate of the virus has risen to between 0.6 and one, compared to the most recent estimate of between 0.6 and 0.9. However, she said that as the number of cases drop, the reproduction number becomes less reliable. As of last week, some 275 people in Scotland were infectious, she added. On Thursday, 270 people were in hospital with confirmed Covid-19, the First Minister said, up by three in 24 hours. Of these, four were in intensive care - an increase of one. NHS Grampian has named 28 bars and restaurants, three golf clubs and a football club as venues visited by people linked to the cluster.The bars and restaurants are The Bieldside Inn The Bobbin Brewdog Buckie Farm Carvery Cafe Andaluz Cafe Dag Cafe Drummond The Cock and Bull The College Bar The Dutch Mill Dyce Carvery East End Social Club Ferryhill House Hotel The Hawthorn The Howff, The Justice Mill, The Marine Hotel, McGinty\u0027s McNasty\u0027s Malmaison Moonfish Cafe, No 10 Bar O\u0027Donoghues Old Bank Bar Prohibition Soul The Spiders Web, and The Draft Project.Aboyne Golf Club, Deeside Golf Club, Hazlehead Golf Club and Banks O\u0027 Dee Football Club were also cited by the health board.Pub crawls could be banned across Scotland to prevent the spread of coronavirus after an outbreak of cases linked to bars. The First Minister yesterday said her government was researching how to tighten up rules for hospitality businesses because \u0027it could be that what we see here is a pattern which involves people going from one pub to another in the same night\u0027.  Contact tracing is continuing in Aberdeen, with the Scottish government\u0027s health minister saying that getting schools reopened in the city as scheduled next Tuesday is a priority but warned additional measures may be required if necessary.Jeane Freeman told the BBC\u0027s Good Morning Scotland radio programme it was important to recognise the complexity of the cluster - in comparison with similar outbreaks in Inverclyde and Lanarkshire - with the number of venues involved.Ms Freeman said: \u0027It is unlikely that one person has been to all 28 or so venues that have been named - what is more likely is that more than one person has been to more than one venue.\u0027That is part of the complexity of this, the nature of it if you think about some of the other outbreaks that we have responded to, and traced right through to the end of the transmission chain.\u0027In some ways, they\u0027re all very very important but in some ways they have been less complex than this, which is largely centred around the night-time economy in Aberdeen and could be the night-time economy in any city or town.\u0027It is complicated to know exactly where everyone has been and that\u0027s part of test and protect, which of course we need to remember is still under way, we\u0027ve not concluded this yet.\u0027Asked about the process being carried out before schools in the city return next week, she said: \u0027It depends on how quickly the technical problems can be resolved and importantly that our senior statistician confirms that he is confident that that data is robust.\u0027The priority is to get the schools back, we\u0027re being really clear about that as a priority across the country as it\u0027s one of the most important things that we that we do.\u0027If there is a need for additional measures to help us do that, either in the north east or anywhere else, then I think you\u0027ve seen that we are prepared to take those additional steps.\u0027But right at the moment there is nothing to tell me that we need to do more in Aberdeen city that we have already done.\u0027The new restrictions ordered all indoor and outdoor hospitality venues to close by 5pm on Wednesday, prevent residents visiting each other\u0027s homes and impose a five-mile travel limit.Ms Freeman also said discussions had taken place on Wednesday with leaders of both Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils. "},{"url":null,"title":"Brexiteer 73 admits sending party leader Anna Soubry email telling remember MP Jo Cox","story":"Tinder date who strangled British backpacker Grace Millane...Share this article"},{"url":null,"title":"New York AG Letitia James sues dissolve NRA","story":"Share this article James is insisting that the organization be dissolved and not restructured because, she claims, the alleged fraud is so \u0027broad\u0027.    The lawsuit claims that Wayne LaPierre hired his friends in the 1990s and then used NRA funds -

She reflects on its profound appealAs a kid at Jones Beach, New York, I spent a lot of time in the four feet of water at the scalloped, lacy edge of the Atlantic. I can picture the scene clearly: my brother and cousins and I bob up and down in the shallows, waiting for a wave to come and lift us off our feet. We use our arms as rudders to pilot us along the face of a wave as it breaks, depositing us at the foamy intersection where water meets sand. Get up, laugh, repeat.We are mesmerised by that heaving body of water. So is everybody else. On a hot day, and on a holiday, 100,000 other people might be at Jones Beach. Lifeguards sit sentinel at their elevated stations, policing the crowds from behind their mirrored sunglasses. There’s something primal about a day like that at the beach, like all the animals heading to the watering hole. Water is a magnet for our teeming throng of humanity.Such was my introduction to wild swimming, as a child growing up in New York. Over almost four decades of swimming, I have observed the changing scenery behind that practice – from beach to pool to open ocean and back again – and its evolving role in my life. I wrote a book about it, a cultural and scientific exploration of humanity’s relationship with water.What I couldn’t have imagined, of course, was that this book about swimming would be published in a time when most people couldn’t swim.What do you do in a pandemic summer, when you are frozen in place, on indefinite pause from moving like a skipping stone across the globe? What do you do when the domesticated, chlorinated bodies of water you are accustomed to are suddenly closed?Maybe, increasingly desperate under the intense eye of an August sun, you begin to look to the oceans, rivers, lakes and streams nearby – to see them anew. You notice mood, shifting temperature, texture, the days when surface chop precludes getting in. Your own mood reflects that. You can’t get what you want as quickly or as easily as you like. And so you adapt.In Waterlog, his celebrated chronicle of swimming through Britain’s waterways, the naturalist Roger Deakin described swimming as having a transformative, Alice-in-Wonderland quality it was an activity that had power over his perception of self and of time. “When you enter the water, something like metamorphosis happens,” he wrote. “Leaving behind the land, you go through the looking-glass surface and enter a new world … You see and experience when you’re swimming in a way that is completely different from any other.” Your sense of the present, he added, “is overwhelming”.I live in California now. Over the last few months of dedicated wild swimming in the Pacific and in the San Francisco Bay, I have noted both the otherworldliness and the acuteness of experience that Deakin so vividly depicted. The periodic shift in perspective – from land to water level, external to internal, anthropocentric to aquacentric – has helped me get to the other side of many a difficult day.In pre-pandemic times, I swam several mornings a week in the pool, and surfed the rest as conditions allowed. Most of the time, it didn’t matter if it was rainy or cold or blustery I could get into a temperature-controlled outdoor pool year-round and be quite happy. Now my engagement with the water is completely dictated by nature. If there are howling winds, water quality issues, or storm-related runoff, I can’t get in. It’s an exercise in relinquishing control.In this time of isolation, I have found community in the lovely stream of letters from readers, who describe their new embrace of wild swimming, and the process of their own seeking. In my book, Why We Swim, I write that to live deliberately as a swimmer means that you are a seeker: a chaser of the ocean’s blue corduroy, a follower of river veins. It involves a certain kind of bravery to embrace the uncertainty.In those childhood days at Jones Beach, I watched the ways people dipped in and out. Some were just there to cool off: electrifying entry, quick exit. Some stayed awhile, floating and splashing and swimming. Always there were people who kept their distance and didn’t go in at all. But still they came, hypnotised by the pulse of the ocean, alive to the sound of the surf and the smell of the briny air. I liked how the ocean seemed to draw breath, lying placid one moment and rearing up the next, moving us in one rippling mass to and from the horizon.Once, a big wave came and smacked me from behind. Surprise overturning, ass over teakettle. Then a liquid, green room, clouded by sand. Me, swimming and swimming toward nothing. Which way is up? Four feet isn’t very much water, but it’s deep enough to drown in.Time stretched I wondered about the press of my burning lungs, wishing for air. Then time restarted, with an accidental kick to the head from my cousin swimming not two feet away. Gifted this reference point, I scrambled to the surface, my hair wrapped around my face like kelp. Embarrassed and gasping, I looked around. When I realised that no one had noticed I was in trouble, I pretended that I never was. And I turned right back into the sea.What did I find so alluring about the water that I could forgive a murder attempt, and so quickly at that? I was just a young swimmer, going back for more of the magic: the illusion of being native in an environment that is no home to humans.This summer, as I prepare for a flight back to the east coast, an essential trip to be with loved ones in a terribly fraught time, I am gripped by anxiety. So much is unknown. And yet I think about swimming, and wild swimming especially, as a lifelong education in facing down fear.I think back to a year ago, when, in a fluke of airplane routeing, I flew home over Jones Beach. We circled the tower, so low over the barrier beaches that I could see the inidual pinpoints of people amassed on their shores. It was a view of my aquatic childhood that I had never seen before, and as I looked and looked, drinking in the pictures below, I was surprised by the tears that suddenly pricked my eyes.We are pulled to the paradox of water as a source of life and death, and we have figured out myriad ways to conduct ourselves in it. Not everybody is a swimmer, but everyone has a swimming story to tell. In the examination of this universal experience – and it is universal, whether you are fearful of the water or not whether you love it or leave it, you will encounter it at some point in your life – we find ourselves flexing our survival muscles, quietly triumphant at our own persistence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d03bd56c9c122f1238778306815972f6d43136aa/0_52_5073_3046/master/5073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=647eedbb4e83572d3d81f3ca5fec5b12","title":"census bureau americans unemployment economy coronavirus","story":"The US Census Bureau has suspended a weekly survey that painted a bleak picture of American life during the Covid-19 pandemic, with no sign of when, or if, it will resume publishing the report.The “household pulse survey” tracked various quality-of-life measures, such as food sufficiency, internet access and mental health, and was first conducted by the Census Bureau on 23 April to “quickly and efficiently deploy data collected on how people’s lives have been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic”, according to the agency’s website.While data such as weekly unemployment claims released by the Department of Labor has shown how many people have lost their jobs, the survey provided a window into the effect the economic downturn is having on the lives of Americans.US households were asked whether they had enough food to eat and internet availability for education, if they had experienced depression or anxiety over the last seven days, and whether they felt they could afford next month’s rent or mortgage payments, among other questions.Over the past three months, the survey painted a desolate picture of what American households are experiencing during the pandemic – a picture that showed little sign of improvement.The Census Bureau described the survey as “experimental”. It was administered via a 20-minute series of online questions. The agency “scientifically selected” addresses to represent the whole US population. People from those addresses received emails with a link to the survey. Administering the survey cost the agency $1.2m, according to NPR.The survey was intended to last 90 days, with the last of the survey’s data from that period being released on 29 July. The Office of Management and Budget, the largest office in the White House, approved for the survey to be administered until the end of July. It is unclear whether the OMB will agree to let the survey continue.“The Census Bureau is working closely with the OMB to determine the possibility for a second phase of the household pulse survey. We will announce any details as soon as they are available,” a spokesperson for the agency wrote in an email to the .The bureau is currently hard at work trying to administer its once-in-a-decade census, trying to count everybody in the US amid the pandemic.The bureau has also been subject to political pressure, recently announcing it will be shortening the census deadline. Though the bureau had in April asked Congress to extend its deadline, it offered no explanation for the reversal.The move is expected to lead to an undercount of Americans, particularly communities of color and poorer Americans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9c2f404fa0f436a34e17e31011a3f7037f9bf25/0_43_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8c5c9d26c89171de126db66e1285a95","title":"negative uk interest rates were once unthinkable but tough times lay ahead","story":"With the power of ultra-low rates and QE fading, the Bank of England is now considering going negativeOne option for Threadneedle Street would be to say it is effectively out of options and pass responsibility for further stimulus over to the chancellor. After more than a decade of ultra-low interest rates and hundreds of billions’ of QE, there is a strong case for fiscal policy – tax cuts and public spending increases – doing the heavy lifting.There would, though, be one last thing the Bank could try, and that option – negative interest rates – is now under active consideration. In the event that the economy does materially worse than the Bank’s monetary policy committee is predicting, the official interest rate would be cut below zero.In the past, notably during the financial crisis of 2008-09, Threadneedle Street has publicly rejected the use of negative rates, warning that they would make banks less profitable and potentially drive some of them to the wall.But as the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, noted on Thursday, life has moved on. Banks are less vulnerable than they were a decade or so ago, other central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, have used them, and estimates of how low interest rates can go have moved down. “Ten years is a long time in monetary policy,” Bailey said in a nod to Harold Wilson.The seriousness with which negative rates are being considered can be judged by the fact that the Bank devoted four pages of its latest monetary policy report (MPR) to weighing up the pros and cons. You don’t do that if you are trying to kick the idea into the long grass.Bailey’s response to a question about negative rates at his MPR press conference was also revealing. “This is the most extensive assessment we have ever done,” the governor said. “It is sensible to have negative interest rates in the toolbox, but we are not planning to use them at the moment.”The key words there are “at the moment”. Although the economy has performed a bit more strongly than the Bank envisaged in the scenario it sketched out three months ago, it thinks the pace of recovery will slow and be more protracted. What’s more, it views the risks as being very much to the downside.What does that mean? It means there is no prospect of monetary policy being tightened for a very long time, as the MPR made clear. It means that there will probably be more QE as activity slows over the winter. And it means that the debate about the use of negative rates will not go away. The use of them remains a case of if not when, but markets should take note of Bailey’s warning that there are some “hard yards” ahead. What was once unthinkable is no longer so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e92dae7b101d261540aaefddbd00e552f916de2/0_504_7085_4254/master/7085.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=076e28f2f96d775670a1cca8ccc64680","title":"what would negative interest rate mean uk consumers","story":"Bank of England is considering pros and cons of drastic move as Covid-19 weighs on economyIf it’s a fixed-rate mortgage, a cut in interest rates would mean no change.

But the drop is likely to be limited by terms and conditions. Skipton building society, for example, has a tracker at 1.29 percentage points above the base rate that can only go up.You will need to dig out your paperwork to see how low your mortgage rate could go.The cheapest tracker mortgages from earlier in the year have been pulled and repriced with larger margins, to cushion lenders against falling rates. If rates are cut again, expect more of that, as well as the collars already seen on some deals.A negative base rate means banks and building societies have to pay to keep money on deposit, and it is designed to discourage them from doing so and make them keen to lend.Credit card rates are usually low for new customers, but rise far above the base rate once introductory periods have ended, so will not be anywhere close to falling into negative territory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/544def3f2d18605dedf8663479980b508072ce3a/0_0_3047_1828/master/3047.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=dda475887e74f7ea4facac86ae179ab9","title":"sanctions china politics us showdown","story":"The complex history of how China and the US once embraced each other should inform how the current showdown is tackledThe Trump administration has floated the idea of sanctioning Chinese officials and members of the Communist party of China. Before we ask whether this is a good idea, let’s ask how Sino-US relations got to this stage.The US cold war with the Soviet Union was over ideology, but today’s standoff with China is different. The Chinese state has no ideology, no religion, no moral agenda. It continues wearing socialist garb but only as a face-saving pretence. It has, in fact, become a state-capitalist dictatorship. What the world sees today is a contest between the US system of free-market capitalism and Chinese state capitalism. How should we read this chessboard?The post-Mao dictatorship in China has lived by the principle of “repress at home and be open to the world”. It has imported knowhow from abroad. There are an estimated 360,000 Chinese students currently enrolled who have come through America’s open door. Over 40 years, at least a million have returned to China and fed their new technical knowledge into the existing authoritarian structures that have built the dictatorship. It might be the most momentous personnel transfer in history. When I applied to study in the US in the 1980s, I filled out a questionnaire that asked if I had ever been a member of the Communist party. The point of the question was presumably to avoid ideological risks. But it is beyond doubt that the Chinese students coming in with me included many party members who were headed to some of the US’s finest schools, often with scholarships. Americans generally assumed that these students would feel the appeal of liberal values, which they would then take back to China. What happened more often, though, was that Chinese students were quick to see the cultural differences between the two countries, and to draw the very logical conclusion that American values are fine for America but would never work in the Chinese system.If those US hopes for the exportation of values had panned out, much of China would have been won over by now. But what has actually happened? Returnees are now leaders in much of Chinese business and industry, but anti-American expression in China is as strong today as it has been since the Mao era.Washington bears much of the responsibility for what has happened. In the years after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, administrations of both parties touted the absurd theory that the best plan was to let China get rich and then watch as freedom and democracy evolved as byproducts of capitalist development.But did capitalist competition, that ravenous machine that can chew up anything, change China? The regime’s politics did not change a whit. What did change was the US, whose business leaders now approached the Chinese dictatorship with obsequious smiles. Here, after all, was an exciting new business partner: master of a realm in which there were virtually no labour rights or health and safety regulations, no frustrating delays because of squabbles between political parties, no criticism from free media, and no danger of judgment by independent courts. For European and US companies doing manufacture for export, it was a dream come true.Money rained down on parts of China, it is true. But the price was to mortgage the country’s future. Society fell into a moral swamp, devoid of humanity and difficult to escape. Meanwhile, the west made their adjustments. They stopped talking about liberal values and gave a pass to the dictatorship, in which Deng Xiaoping’s advice of “don’t confront” and Jiang Zemin’s of “lie low and make big bucks” made fast economic growth possible.European and American business thrived in the early stages of the China boom. They sat in a sedan chair carried up the mountain by their Chinese partners. And a fine journey it was – crisp air, bright sun – as they reached the mountain’s midpoint. But then the chair-carriers laid down their poles and began demanding a shift. They, too, sought the top position. The signal from the political centre in China changed from “don’t pick fights” to “go for it”. Now what could the western capitalists do? Walk back down the mountain? They hardly knew the way.Covid-19 has jolted the US into semi-awareness of the crisis it faces. The disease has become a political issue for its two major political parties to tussle over, but the real crisis is that the western system itself has been challenged. The US model appears to others as a bureaucratic jumble of competing interests that lacks long-term vision and historical aspiration, that omits ideals, that runs on short-term pragmatism, and that in the end is hostage to corporate capital.Are sanctions the way to go? A foreign ministry spokesperson in Beijing recently remarked words to the effect that the US and China are so economically interlocked that they would amount to self-sanctions. The US, moreover, would be no match for China in its ability to endure suffering. And there he was correct: in dictatorships, sacrifices are not borne by the rulers. In the 1960s Mao said: “Cut us off? Go ahead – eight years, 10 years, China has everything.” A few years later Mao had nuclear weapons and was not afraid of anyone.The west needs to reconsider its systems, its political and cultural prospects, and rediscover its humanitarianism. These challenges are not only political, they are intellectual. It is time to abandon the old thinking and the vocabulary that controls it. Without new vocabulary, new thinking cannot be born. In the current struggle in Hong Kong, for example, the theory is simple and the faith is pure. The new political generation in Hong Kong deserves careful respect from the west, and new vocabulary to talk about it.“Sanctions” is a cold war term that names an old policy. If the US can’t think beyond them, the primacy of its position in this changing world will disappear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e069d5318b29e9dae314fad0a3a7bd629f0583c/163_0_6398_3840/master/6398.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0973860d321139ad3cb42e1510d98ad8","title":"chinese fleet fishing galapagos islands environment","story":"Jonathan Green had been tracking a whale shark named Hope across the eastern Pacific for 280 days when the satellite transmissions from a GPS tag on her dorsal fin abruptly stopped.It was not unusual for the GPS signal to go silent, even for weeks at a time, said Green, a scientist who has been studying the world’s largest fish for three decades in the unique marine ecosystem around the Galápagos Islands.But then he looked at satellite images in the area where Hope was last tracked – more than a thousand nautical miles west of the islands – and noticed the ocean was being patrolled by hundreds of Chinese fishing boats.“I began to look into it and found that at the very end of her track she began to speed up,” said Green, co-founder and director of the Galápagos Whale Shark Project.“It went from one knot to six or seven knots for the last 32 minutes – which is, of course, the speed of a fishing boat,” he said.The fishing vessels that Green saw on the satellite images are believed to belong to an enormous Chinese-flagged fleet which Ecuadorian authorities last week warned was just outside the Galápagos Islands’ territorial waters.“I don’t have proof but my hypothesis is that she was caught by vessels from the same fleet which is now situated to the south of the islands,” Green told the . She is the third GPS-tracked whale shark to have gone missing in the last decade, he added.The Chinese fleet, numbering more than 200 vessels, is in international waters just outside a maritime border around the Galápagos Islands and also Ecuador’s coastal waters, said Norman Wray, the islands’ governor.Chinese fishing vessels come every year to the seas around the Galápagos, which were declared a Unesco world heritage site in 1978, but this year’s fleet is one of the largest seen in recent years. Of the 248 vessels, 243 are flagged to China including to companies with suspected records of illegal, unreported and unregulated, or IUU, fishing, according to research by C4ADS, a data analysis NGO.The fleet includes fishing boats and refrigerated container – or reefer – ships to store enormous catches.Transferring cargo between vessels is prohibited under international maritime law yet the Chinese flotilla has supply and storage ships along with longline and squid fishing boats.“There are some fleets which don’t seem to abide by any regulations,” said Wray.One captain of an Ecuadorian tuna boat saw the Chinese fishing boats up close in early July, before the end of the tuna season.“They just pull up everything!” said the captain, who asked not to be named. “We are obliged to take a biologist aboard who checks our haul if we catch a shark we have to put it back, but who controls them?”He recalled navigating through the fleet at night, constantly changing course to avoid boats, as their lights illuminated the sea to attract squid to the surface.“It was like looking at a city at night,” he said.The longline fishing boats had up to 500 lines, each with thousands of fishhooks, he estimated, and claimed that some of the vessels would turn off their automatic tracking systems to avoid detection, particularly when operating in protected areas.Chinese fishing practices first caught the attention of Ecuador in 2017 when its navy seized the Chinese reefer Fu Yuan Yu Leng 999 within the Galápagos marine reserve. Inside its containers were 6,000 frozen sharks – including the endangered hammerhead shark and whale shark.“It was a slaughterhouse,” said Green, describing the images of the cargo hold. “This kind of slaughter is going on on a massive scale in international waters and nobody is witnessing it.”The seizure prompted protests outside the Chinese embassy in Quito Ecuador fined the vessel $6m and the 20 Chinese crew-members were later jailed for up to four years for illegal fishing.The arrival of the latest fleet has also stirred public outrage and a formal complaint by Ecuador as its navy is on alert for any incursion into Ecuadorian waters.The Chinese embassy in Quito said that China was a “responsible fishing nation” with a “zero-tolerance” attitude towards illegal fishing. It had confirmed with Ecuador’s navy that all the Chinese fishing vessels were operating legally “and don’t represent a threat to anyone”, it said in a statement last month. On Thursday China announced a three-month fishing ban in the high seas west of the marine reserve, but it will not come into force until September.Roque Sevilla, a former mayor of Quito, who is leading a team in charge of designing a “protection strategy” for the islands, said the fleet practices “indiscriminate fishing – regardless of species or age – which is causing a serious deterioration of the quality of fauna that we will have in our seas”.Ecuador would establish a corridor of marine reserves with Pacific-facing neighbours Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia to seal off important areas of marine ersity, Sevilla told the .Protecting the Cocos Ridge, an underwater mountain range which connects the Galápagos Islands to mainland Costa Rica, and the Carnegie Ridge which links the archipelago to Ecuador and continental South America, could close off more than 200,000 sq nautical miles of ocean otherwise vulnerable to industrial fishing, he said.He added Ecuador had called for a diplomatic meeting with Chile, Peru, Colombia and Panama to present a formal protest against China.“When the Galápagos’s protected area was first created it was cutting edge,” said Matt Rand, director of the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy, “but compared to other newer marine protected areas Galápagos is now potentially lacking in size to protect the bioersity.”Milton Castillo, the Galápagos Islands’ representative for Ecuador’s human rights ombudsman’s office, said he had asked the prosecutor’s office to inspect the cargo holds of the Chinese ships based on the legal principle of the universal and extraterritorial protection of endangered species.China’s distant-water fishing fleet is the biggest in the world, with nearly 17,000 vessels – 1,000 of which use “flags of convenience” and are registered in other countries, according to research by the Overseas Development Institute.The fleet often fishes in the territorial waters of low-income countries, the report said, having depleted fish stocks in domestic waters.Green said the “explosion of life” created by the confluence of cold and warm ocean currents around the Galápagos Islands is exactly why the Chinese armada is hovering around the archipelago’s waters.“The Galápagos marine reserve is a place of very great productivity, high biomass but also bioersity,” he said. The longline fishing technique used by the fleet catch big fish like tuna, but also sharks, rays, turtles and marine mammals like sea lions and dolphins, he added.“This is not fishing any more, it is simply destroying the resources of our oceans,” Green said. “We should ask whether any nation on this planet has the right to destroy what is common ground.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3f9399173cd7dfa2c83248ee4dbd9ef35973269/0_279_5924_3555/master/5924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab03367f9573ce7ad7ba83378268de66","title":"co2 extreme droughts in central europe likely to increase seven fold","story":"Researchers say moderate reductions in CO2 emissions could halve their likelihoodExtreme droughts are likely to become much more frequent across central Europe, and if global greenhouse gas emissions rise strongly they could happen seven times more often, new research has shown.The area of crops likely to be affected by drought is also set to increase, and under sharply rising CO2 levels would nearly double in central Europe in the second half of this century, to more than 40m hectares (154,440 sq miles) of farmland.Central Europe suffered its biggest and most damaging drought on record in 2018 and 2019, which had two of the three warmest summer periods ever recorded on the continent. The summers were also much drier than average, and more than half of the region suffered severe drought conditions.Rivers and watercourses dried up, some crops were ruined and wildfires increased during these two years of extreme drought. The only other drought on record to come close, in 1949 and 1950, affected a land area about a third smaller.Rohini Kumar, one of the authors of the study, told the  the findings were concerning. “The findings indicate that introducing measures to reduce future carbon emissions may lower the risk of more frequent consecutive drought events across Europe. On the one hand, we need to step up our efforts to reduce greenhouse gases worldwide, and at the same time deal with strategies to adapt to climate change.”Strong reductions in greenhouse gases would reduce the frequency of such extreme droughts to “a very negligible number”, said Kumar.The paper is published on Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.The study adds to an increasing body of research showing the impacts of global heating on Europe. Previous studies have suggested that southern and central Europe will experience more drought, with one study projecting that European cities will become much hotter, with London forecast to have a climate more like Barcelona by 2050 and southern and central European cities seeing more extreme levels of heat.Constantin Zohner, of the Crowther Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, who was not involved in the research, said the study showed the consequences of failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

Peter Burgess, director of conservation at Devon Wildlife Trust, which has overseen the reintroduction trial, told the : “There have been some sleepless nights, and it was very stressful in the early stages. We knew the benefits, but things were hanging on a knife edge over securing the licence at the beginning.”The beavers started out as interlopers, when a family group were found to be living on the River Otter in 2013, their origins unknown. They were threatened with removal, but the Devon Wildlife Trust and community groups stepped in and tried to show the beavers were European, rather than north American, and eventually gained a licence for a five-year trial, which was extended in February to conclude this month.The dams also filter out pollutants and stop topsoil being washed away.Key to the success of the River Otter project was getting local people and farmers involved and explaining the benefits beavers can bring, as well as providing support when needed, said Burgess. There were several incidents of localised flooding of farmland, when the landowners were concerned, but by providing expert support the reintroduction team were able to resolve the problems.“If landowners know there’s someone they can pick up the phone to, it really helps,” Burgess said. “Animals are much more likely to be welcomed if that is the approach.”Beavers can grow to 20kg, but contrary to popular misconceptions, live on an exclusively vegetarian diet and do not eat fish.Richard Benwell, chief executive of the Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “It’s great to see that the reintroduction of beavers in this trial has resulted in a win-win for the local area, boosting wildlife and tackling man-made problems. The trial clearly proves the benefits of nature-based solutions to dealing with flooding, water quality and resilience to climate change.“We hope to see more such welcome projects introduced by government as part of flooding, water and climate planning.”However, Phil Jarvis, chair of the environment forum at the National Farmers’ Union, warned that farmers would want to see an “exit strategy”, as well as adequate funding and a long-term management plan, before any expansion. “Beavers can have a significant local impact on the countryside and farming from creating dams that can undermine riverbanks, to impeding farmland drainage with waterlogged fields becoming unsuitable for grazing and cropping all lead to serious implications on our ability to produce food,” he said.“We must see a well-thought through exit strategy if any major issues occur.”No more releases in the wild will be allowed until the consultation is complete. Rebecca Pow, environment minister, said: “We are firmly committed to providing opportunities to reintroduce formerly native species, such as beavers, where the benefits for the environment, people and the economy are clear.“But we also understand that there are implications for landowners, and take care to ensure that all potential impacts are carefully considered.”• This article was amended on 6 August 2020 to clarify in the first paragraph that the beaver colony discussed is the first to live wild in England for hundreds of years, not the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fa6bb2405ab7526c95c5aacdb8717700a36d87c/318_0_3185_1911/master/3185.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8406f3f09450d1c7111116d90c8e63bb","title":"manchester city to demand 30m deal for eric garcia barcelona turns down contract","story":"Manchester City will not sell Eric García for less than £20m plus £10m in add-ons, with Barcelona wanting to re-sign the 19-year-old, who has signalled his desire to leave after refusing a new deal.The centre-back is out of contract next summer yet City are intent they will not allow his sale other than for a package similar to the £24.5m fee before add-ons that took Ferran Torres from Valencia to the club this week. This is because the 20-year-old forward is similar in age and profile to García.Although García’s decision could be disruptive before City’s Champions League last-16 second leg at home to Real Madrid on Friday, it is understood he remains in contention for selection.Whether Pep Guardiola will pick him ahead of the vastly more experienced Fernandinho, the 35-year-old midfielder who has operated at centre-back for most of the season, is unclear. Guardiola remains hopeful that García, whom he rates highly, could change his mind and stay, though the manager recognises the pull of Barcelona is strong.Guardiola was bullish about knocking out Madrid, whom they lead 2-1, and seizing the chance to claim City’s first European Cup but he warned his team against the defensive frailties that have cost them dear in previous years. He has previously questioned City’s readiness to win the competition, so his mood signalled a significant shift.“I have the feeling we are ready to play the game tomorrow and do a good performance and win the game,” he said. Speaking more generally about City’s ability to go all the way, he added: “I have that feeling. We are ready.”In City’s past three campaigns under Guardiola they have faltered because of a shaky defence. In 2017 a 5-3 lead over Monaco from the first leg was ceded as City lost 3-1 in France to be eliminated on away goals. At Anfield the following year three goals in 19 minutes gave Liverpool an unassailable lead and City were knocked out 5-1 on aggregate. Last season two goals from Son Heung-min in three minutes presaged Tottenham’s progression on away goals.Guardiola acknowledged this had to end. “More than conceding, it’s the way we concede them,” he said. “If they are brilliant we accept them but mostly these are goals we could avoid. Mistakes in this competition punish you a lot. We’ve spoken about it in important games: if we want to make a step forward and win this competition we have to be better in this area.”Lazio are in negotiations with David Silva regarding a free transfer at the end of the season on a two- or three-year deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b02369cdf2becb27eaede7e29be6f2b523b83830/0_107_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08eead932521567c70e330b46ded09e3","title":"premier league clubs reject chance to continue with five substitutions","story":"Premier League sides will return to the old normal next season after it was confirmed they will no longer be allowed to make five substitutions during a match.A temporary measure introduced to help prevent injury during matches delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the rule was renewed by Fifa for the duration of the 2020-21 season.Leagues are free to determine whether to introduce the measure and at the Premier League’s AGM on Thursday clubs voted overwhelmingly against it. They will return to making a maximum of three substitutes from a bench of seven players.The five-substitutes rule was widely perceived to favour bigger clubs with deeper squads. The use of drinks breaks during each half is another measure that will not feature next season.The 20 shareholders – which for the first time included the promoted sides Leeds United, West Bromwich Albion and Fulham – held preliminary discussions over a plan for curtailment should the necessity arise in the event of a resurgence of the coronavirus.The league also confirmed that it would fully implement Fifa’s VAR protocols from next season. The controversial technology had been used differently in England to a number of other countries, including a recommendation that referees should not use their pitchside monitors.Clubs voted unanimously for the protocols, meaning that there will be increased use of monitors and a more consistently punitive approach to goalkeepers moving off their line when facing a penalty.Implementing the Fifa rules means no “tolerance levels” for offside, ending hopes that referees may be able to use their judgment in the case of hairline decisions. Fifa is researching the possibility of introducing more leeway, which would favour the attacker, into the offside rule.After a long period of intensive and frequent meetings, the Premier League is now not scheduled to gather until September.

They offer visitors spectacular beaches, cobalt sea, prehistoric sites dating back more than 5,000 years, and soul-soothingly beautiful natural landscapes. With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta is ideal for some restorative R\u0026ampR, and you can get here with minimal stress, no jet lag, and only a short-haul flight from the UK.Day one: soak up VallettaStart to unwind in Valletta, Malta’s elegant coastal capital, where five-star and boutique hotels offer spa treatments, massages and hot tubs and pools overlooking beautiful views. You could spend your first day exploring some of the attractions of this Unesco world heritage site, one of the world’s most beautiful and unspoilt cities. Its pedestrianised centre is full of pavement cafes to relax and enjoy a drink in the warm sunshine. You can dine in the evening at outdoor, sea-facing restaurants, eating fresh seafood and other delicious local cuisine, and enjoy the warm Mediterranean sun.Day two: more spas, speedboats and the ‘silent city’Valletta is renowned for its spectacular boutique hotels, such as the glorious Palazzo Consiglia with an underground spa and rooftop pool. One suite in SU29 has a rooftop Jacuzzi-with-a-view, as do the suites in the historic townhouse of Casa Ellul. Locanda La Gelsomina, over the harbour in the even-more-relaxing small town of Birgu, offers in-house massages, private yoga and a Japanese Zen sound bath.Once you’ve spent a day smoothing out any knots, it’s an easy trip by bus or car to take it easy on the beautiful beaches of Golden Bay or Għajn Tuffieħa for a day of beach relaxation. This astoundingly scenic chain of soft-sanded beaches is lapped by the warm Mediterranean Sea, and offers every kind of watersports: indulge in some stand-up paddleboarding, waterskiing or take a speedboat along the coast to see the otherworldly rock formations and caves that glint with reflected blue light. The beachfront Radisson Blu Resort \u0026amp Spa has superb spa facilities, or you could base yourself in a seaside town such as Mellieħa, close to another white-sanded beach, with lots of hotel choices.A cobweb-clearing walk along Malta’s Dingli cliffs offers sweeping panoramas for miles across the ocean, and you could finish the day with a meal in the tranquil “silent city” of Mdina. This hilltop, walled, golden-stone old capital, with its atmospheric and historic narrow lanes, is best experienced after all the daytime visitors have ebbed away.Days three and four: go Zen in GozoOn your third and fourth days, slow down your pace even more by heading to the neighbouring smaller island of Gozo, only a short trip by ferry. Hidden coves are reached via flights of vertiginous steps, with pale copper sands lapped by azure waters. Artist and poet Edward Lear visited in the 19th century and was so taken with this curious, dramatic landscape that he invented words to describe it: calling it “pomskizillious” and “gromophiberous”.Gozo’s country roads are ideal for cycling or walks, with sea views and seemingly hugely outsized churches in the middle of the countryside. The island’s famous for the warmth and hospitality of its locals, and is the kind of place where no one bothers locking their front door. Gozo is famous for its large, rentable “farmhouses” with gardens and pools, as well as some spectacular hotels, such as chic haven ThirtySeven and the five-star hideaway Kempinski Hotel San Lawrenz. You can also dine on spectacular fresh Mediterranean produce here. Gozo has many renowned restaurants, serving zero-mileage local cuisine cooked by some of the best chefs on the archipelago, with ingredients such as the local fresh cheese, locally grown tomatoes and olives, fresh fish, and local wines.Gozo’s five-star spas offer a wide range of treatments and therapies from across the world as well as saunas, Jacuzzis, steam rooms and indoor swimming pools.A longer restIf two days isn’t long enough, extend your Gozo trip with yoga and pilates retreats, which are ideal for longer wellness stays. The week-long Paola’s BodyBarre retreat, for example, gives you the chance to take part in daily pilates, barre, fitness and yoga fusion sessions, as well as excursions to copper-sanded Ramla Bay, the cerulean Blue Lagoon, Gozo’s coastal salt pans, and the vast Ġgantija temples, which predate Stonehenge. The next retreat will take place in 2021, for more information email: office.uk@visitmalta.It’s remarkable how many relaxation and wellness activities you can fit in over a four-day weekend trip to Malta, recharging in beautiful settings or keeping active outdoors (although longer trips to Malta and Gozo are to be encouraged – there’s a lot that cannot be covered in a four-day trip). Book your wellness trip to Malta today to restore a sense of balance, for a holiday whose effects will last long after your return.In the wake of Covid-19 things are changing fast, so do check the latest advice from the Foreign Office before making any travel decisions and contact any hotels, restaurants or attractions mentioned in this article for the latest information on availability and opening times.

Over the past decade, the country has become a world leader on LGBTQ+ rights, from same-sex marriage and equal adoption, to liberal gender recognition laws for trans people. In fact, Malta was the first European country to protect people from discrimination based on gender identity or expression, and allows those who identify as neither man nor woman to use an “x” marker on official documents.The result? A place where LGBTQ+ people can live openly, and tourists can travel as their authentic selves. “I saw same-sex couples in straight bars feeling comfortable enough to kiss and honestly that always makes me happy,” Akbar recalls.Raucousness is just one part of Malta’s multifaceted LGBTQ+ offering, however, and Akbar notes that it’s also an ideal destination for a chilled holiday. “I think Malta has its own vibe, and I’d recommend it to LGBTQ+ travellers for a laid-back but queer-friendly holiday that’s inclusive.”The mix of vibrant nightlife and calm relaxation is something that 26-year-old drag performer and comedian Chucky Bartolo appreciates about Malta, too. Having been born and raised there, Bartolo recently moved to Glasgow, but returns to Malta to perform regularly. “There’s one party a month that I love called Lollipop,” which he says has grown into a huge bash over the years. “It’s thousands of people, every time.” And when LGBTQ+ travellers aren’t painting the town red, “people can lay around in Speedos, they can hold hands, kiss by the pool and no one cares. That’s great.”Bartolo recommends LGBTQ+ travellers visit the (somewhat ironically named) Strait Street, a historically flamboyant locale in the capital city of Valletta that used to be popular with sailors when Malta was under British rule. “It’s a great place, there are really cute bars and if you’re a gay couple kissing in the street, no one is going to bat an eye.”Malta’s queer nightlife doesn’t just provide a safe space for travellers and revellers, though. For Maxine Sophia Attard, a transgender performer who goes by the moniker MadameMaxxx, the queer scene also allows LGBTQ+ performers and artists to express themselves. Michelangelo, a club just outside of trendy Sliema, is one such venue Attard says their promotion and embracing of ersity has been part of what she describes as a “big improvement” in terms of people’s attitudes to the trans community in Malta.While there are a number of LGBTQ+ specific venues to enjoy, Bartolo notes that “most LGBTQ+ people just go to regular clubs”, as, widely speaking, everyone has always been accommodating. “When I go out, I’ll just go out to a regular club with gay people and my female friends. Malta’s nightlife is amazing and crazy,” he says.Inclusivity isn’t something that just happens, as 31-year-old Lilla Salamon can tell you. She’s one of many straight allies who have supported the island’s LGBTQ+ community, and her Gay Guide to Malta provides “up-to-date information on what to expect in Malta during their stay”, she says. “I had been working in marketing for 10 years, and after the Civil Union Act update in 2014 I noticed that businesses were trying to open their minds and doors to LGBTQ+ clients. They just had no idea how to do it, apart from sponsoring Pride week. With Gay Guide Malta I gave them a platform to talk to the LGBTQ+ community, both local and foreign, directly.”It would be remiss to talk about LGBTQ+ travel without mentioning Malta Pride, sadly cancelled this year, which has grown exponentially in the past five years, becoming a “massive, international-style Pride”, according to Bartolo. For 10 hours, the city of Valletta is closed down as everyone comes out to celebrate. There’s also a erse, week-long programme of talks and events, including LGBTQ+ inclusive football games.For Pride week, Salamon says that through Gay Guide Malta she encourages all the hotels she works with on the island to offer packages catering to LGBTQ+ travellers looking for a fun time. She also helps people who are planning same-sex weddings in the country, too. With affordable flights, it’s easy to get family members over for trips. It’s something she says has “upped the game for Malta”. “We have wedding packages,” she adds. “I only work with the best of the best.

More than 200 days since coronavirus was first detected, public health authorities say the number of infections is accelerating and the peak still lies ahead. In early August, the world finds itself at a nebulous stage: past the shock of the pandemic but without a clear end in sight.  international correspondent Michael Safi talks to Rachel Humphreys about the different ways in which countries have dealt with the virus – from some in Europe who seemed to have bent the curve but are now experiencing a second wave to developing nations such as Pakistan who felt quarantine posed a greater risk to life than coronavirus itself.

One health official described the data as “like Nirvana” for street-level disease control.The government’s shift follows weeks of pressure from local authorities who have said the centrally run system, which Boris Johnson maintained on Thursday was “world beating”, was hampering their ability to tackle the virus.A growing number of local authorities, including several with some of the highest infection rates in the UK, decided to set up their own localised test-and-trace operations owing to concerns that the national system was failing to reach many of the most vulnerable residents, particularly in poorer areas and areas with higher proportions of black, Asian and minority ethnic households.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health and social care secretary, said: “These developments should help local authorities. But it’s now clear Boris Johnson’s £10bn top-down tracing regime ran by Serco is nowhere near world beating as he promised. A truly virus-beating service would provide all local areas with detailed datasets, ensure those isolating had financial support, and allow local health officials to lead contact tracing.”The latest official figures from NHS Test and Trace in England showed that the scheme was still failing to reach a significant proportion of those who had been in close contact with an infected person.Officials say some of these missed people could not be reached because the infected person had no contact details for them – for example, they had been sitting next to someone on a bus – or the contacts had not responded to texts, emails and calls. The figures show that in about half of these cases details were available but the contact was not reached.Household transmission, however, has been identified as a key passage of Covid-19, so ensuring family members self isolate and get tested is crucial to clamping down on the virus.Councils have to sign a data protection agreement before they can access patient-identifiable data. On Thursday Sheffield city council was given access to Public Health England’s Covid database, which shows in near real time who is testing positive and where any clusters are occurring.It is understood that Bradford, Rochdale and Calderdale councils are in discussions with the government about setting up their own supplementary versions of test and trace, using improved data and a ringfenced team of specialist contact tracers assigned from the national system.Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA), which covers a population of 2.8 million people, is also in discussion with Public Health England about taking on more locally controlled tracing.A significant number of people with Covid-19, such as those asymptomatic who have not sought a test, will not appear in the official testing figures, which means the contract tracers will only be able to reach a small proportion of infected people.The ONS infection survey, which models infection rates based on a household survey, estimates that there were 36,000 new cases in the most recent week for which data was available."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d402e1e0aeaa068b068a2d28ec1309809148b309/0_407_6149_3692/master/6149.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc4dd61536ccea9ceea7c13dd913cec3","title":"which sports and exercises have you been enjoying for the first time in uk","story":"During the lockdown, many people only left home for exercise.

Therefore we cannot embark on that intensely personal journey from Blackheath to Buckingham Palace, with the crowd cheering us on, with the gods of our sport leading the way, running together in mind, body and spirit with tens of thousands of people.”Organisers are hoping that everyone with a place in the 2020 event will still run or walk the 26.2-mile marathon distance on 4 October, albeit not on the traditional London course, in order to raise money for charity and promote the benefits of good health. Brasher confirmed that everyone who does so would still get a coveted finisher medal and T-shirt – and that runners and charities would also be able to defer their place to a future London Marathon in 2021, 2022 or 2023.“While the London Marathon we know and love cannot take place on Sunday 4 October, I ask you to join us in a new London Marathon, on the same day, in the same spirit, but in a way that not only helps our charities with desperately needed fundraising, but also shows the spirit of our community is not dimmed and burns as brightly as ever,” said Brasher.“We believe that Sunday 4 October will be a London Marathon like no other. Together we will get through it. That is the spirit of the London Marathon.”Brasher also revealed organisers had spent five months working on a socially distanced mass-participation race, using revolutionary Bluetooth and ultra-wide ranging technology that would have alerted runners if they got too close to each other, only for the plan to be scuppered at the last moment.“This new technology would have enabled us to accurately monitor every participant’s distance from each other, work out if the participant spent more than 15 minutes within 1.5 metres (or any distance we set) of anyone else and then contact them post-event if anyone had informed us that they had contracted Covid-19 in the two weeks after the event.”Brasher said that the biggest challenge his team faced did not come from having 45,000 runners on the course – but the “multiple issues” of managing 750,000 spectators, the fears of a second spike, and the concern about the pressures the race might put on the NHS. “Despite all our efforts it has not been possible to go ahead with a mass socially distanced walk or run.”Five elite athletes have been confirmed, with the long-awaited showdown between Kenya’s world marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge and the world 5,000m and 10,000m record holder Kenenisa Bekele headlining the men’s race and Brigid Kosgei, the women’s world record holder, also going for her second London title. A number of other big names are expected to be named in the coming weeks.Brasher confirmed the race would conform to official World Athletics standards and insisted it was not unfeasible to expect a world record given the calibre of those competing and the new course. “It’s faster than the normal London marathon course,” he said.He also confirmed that while there would be no spectators cheering the elite athletes on in the biosecure bubble in St James’ Park, organisers planned to use “virtual reality crowds” to recreate the atmosphere of a big event."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec8651924bb22ded4519779c3cb1db56b6d79e20/0_148_2825_1695/master/2825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0326913d139a4f0e5ebced2ca9e98efa","title":"2020 pga championship golf first round live","story":"Rory bounces back by screeching his second at the short par-four 16th to four feet, and making the birdie putt. He’s +1 and there’s a slight spring in his step again as he makes off to the next tee. Meanwhile a dismal three-putt for Justin Rose on the par-three 17th, and he’s far from happy, gesticulating in anger at some squeak from the sidelines. No crowd to blame, of course to be honest, it was a poor pull from four feet. He’s -1.Another birdie for Scottie Scheffler, this time at 3, gives the 24-year-old from New Jersey a share of the lead again. Jason Day birdies 1 to remain in hot pursuit, but Bud Cauley and Alex Noren drop strokes at 8 and 6 respectively to slip back to -2.Justin Rose rakes in a 40-footer across 16 to move to -2. Dustin Johnson stays one ahead of him by guiding in a 15-foot left-to-right slider on 16 he’s -3. And Tom Lewis - who came very close last week at the WGC St Jude, shooting 61-66 over a brilliant weekend - opens with birdie at 1. Lewis shot 65 on the first day of the 2011 Open at Sandwich as an amateur. His professional career has taken a while to get going, but the 29-year-old from Welwyn Garden City is beginning to make his mark now. He’s a very decent outside bet to become England’s first winner since 1919 (!).Another birdie for Koepka, who gets fazed by very little other than slow play. Good on the big man, it’s the scourge of the game. Anyway, this one comes at the short par-four 16th he’s positioned nicely at -2 alongside another former champion moving in the right direction after a bang-average start. Martin Kaymer, who pipped Bubba Watson in the 2010 play off, has more than cancelled out a bogey at 11 with birdies at 14, 17 and now 1.More misery for McIlroy, who has now made it three bogeys in a row, at 14. This one is the result of flaying his tee shot into thick oomska and being forced to take a drop. He’s +2. Meanwhile Tiger walks after a short par putt on 14 ... but it lips out on the right and that’s his first dropped stroke of the morning. He’s -1. And at the top, the 2007 Masters and 2015 Open champ Zach Johnson takes over, with his fourth birdie already, at the short and inviting par-four 16th. The big bombers have a history of doing well at Harding Park ... but it’s a tree-lined course that rewards accuracy, too, and the shorter-hitting Johnson may fancy his chances here.It’s a four-way tie at the top now, with Bud Cauley, Zach Johnson and Alex Noren joining Scottie Scheffler at -3. Noren, approaching veteran status at 38, has a couple of top-ten finishes to his name at the Open, but has done very little in the Stateside majors. His best result in the USA is a 10th-place finish at the 2017 Players, but ten European Tour wins to zero on the PGA Tour tell its own story. Still, Sweden has come close at the PGA before - Henrik Stenson and Jonas Blixt finished third and fourth the year Jason Dufner won (2013) - and there’s no reason Noren can’t make a serious impression this week too.You can’t keep a good four-time major champion down. Brooks Koepka has bounced back from his slow start with back-to-back birdies at 13 and 14. The defending champ rises to -1, and all that early stress evaporates into the ether. Sadly, Rory McIlroy’s round is heading in the other direction. He’s followed that opening birdie at 10 with dropped shots at 12 and 13. He’s +1 and searching in vain for his A-game right now.Scrub that! Several of those lurkers at -1 make birdie - four of them are major winners - while Scheffler turns in 33, then birdies the gentle opening hole. Suddenly it’s all change at the top during the early stages of this championship! Already it looks as though this could be one humdinger of a tournament.Back-to-back bogeys for Daniel Berger, though, at 14 and 15. The former co-leader slips back to where he started the day. Just the 22 players at -1 now. Again: no.Bud Cauley, a 30-year-old from Daytona Beach in Florida, has no record to speak of in the majors, and no PGA Tour wins to his name. A journeyman. Then again, some players develop later than others, and he’s already had a couple of top-ten finishes on Tour this season. It’s not as though relative unknowns come bursting from the pack to snatch the Wanamaker Trophy, either just ask Rich Beem, Shaun Micheel or John Daly. It’s probably a little early for Cauley to start dreaming ... but then again, if you’ve just birdied 1, 4 and 5, more than offsetting a bogey at 2, why not? He’s -2 through 5.It’s nearly ten years since Dustin Johnson infamously grounded his club in a dusty patch to the right of the 72nd hole of the 2010 PGA Championship at Whistling Straits. Assuming it wasn’t a bunker, and going on to make bogey, he thought he’d made a play-off with Martin Kaymer and Bubba Watson. But he’d not read the local rules, and it was. A monumentally confused Johnson was handed a two-shot penalty and ended the week tied for fifth. He’s come close on a few occasions since, most notably last year when he nearly snatched the prize from the hands of a nervous Brooks Koepka. His eventual second-place finish stands as his best at the PGA. Can the 2016 US Open winner go one better this week? Well, he’s started very nicely indeed. Birdies at 10 and 12, and he joins the leaders at -2.Spieth does indeed drop another shot at 12, punishment for that errant drive. The long par-four is usually a par-five for everyday punters, who can rock up and play for 50 bucks if they live in the city and its environs. Get out of position from the tee and you’re in all sorts of bother, especially as there’s out of bounds running down the left. Even so, Spieth gave himself a chance to scramble par by wedging his third to nine feet, but the putt didn’t drop. He barely missed a thing in 2015, when golf looked so easy for him. But golf always wins. He’s +2 through three holes.Some more big names out of the blocks with quickfire birdies! Here come Zach Johnson, Dustin Johnson, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Rory McIlroy, Louis Oosthuizen and ... Tiger Woods. Just the 25 major titles between that lot. They’re all at -1 early doors, just 71 holes away from making it 26.Daniel Berger, by comparison, certainly was expected to feature heavily this week. He’s been bang in form since the restart, with victory at the Charles Schwab Challenge, a tie for third at the RBC Heritage, and a tie for second last week at the WGC St Jude, at which he posted a fine final-day 65. He’d had three top-ten finishes in a row just before the enforced break, too. Long tipped as a major-winner in waiting, could this be his time? Well, he’s started out in the grand fashion, with birdies at 10 and now 13. He joine Scheffler at the top, one shot ahead of 19 players at -1. (That’s a polite way of saying no, I’m not listing them.)Following behind, Jordan Spieth, looking to complete his career slam at the ripe old age of 27. He’s not started particularly brightly either, missing a ten-footer on 10 for birdie, then failing to get up and down from the side of the 11th to save par. There wasn’t a great deal of expectation surrounding Spieth this week, his long game having been off for a good while now, and the early signs certainly don’t encourage an instant root-and-branch reassessment, especially as he’s just driven into rough down the right of the long par-four 12th. Then again, Tiger shot 40 on the front nine at Augusta back in 1997, before breaking all sorts of records en route to victory, so the young Texan won’t be pressing the panic button quite yet.Here comes the defending champion Brooks Koepka, looking to lift the Wanamaker Trophy for the third consecutive time. Good thing he’s got all those muscles, because that is one oversized pot. Not the ideal start, though. He pulled his opening drive, at the makeable par-five 10th, into rough down the left. Not so makeable after all. A par on a hole that’s already been giving up its fair share of birdies. Then he was unable to get up and down from greenside rough at the par-three 11th, and the four-time major winner is off to a very average start. He’s one over through two.The two early leaders have moved back towards the pack. Bogey for Scheffler at 14 a dropped shot for Finau at 13. They slip back to -2 and -1 respectively. Meanwhile more fast starts from a couple of likely lads: the reigning US Open champ Gary Woodland and new sensation Collin Morikawa, who won the Workday Charity Open, an emergency replacement for the John Deere Classic, only last month. We had, rather naively we’ll admit, assumed Sky would be showing the morning’s featured groups, as usual, ahead of the full live coverage beginning later. Nope! There goes our hopes of following Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson and Justin Rose, and Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas in great detail. No doubt a knock-on effect of subscription channel ESPN+ snaffling the rights in the States. They don’t half make some weird decisions, the PGA of America. Hey kids, anyone rememberSome solid starts by a few of the pre-tournament fancies. Jason Day, Daniel Berger, Xander Schauffele, Tyrrell Hatton have all launched their bids with birdies. Stuttering starts by a couple of former champions, though, as Rich Beem (2002), Martin Kaymer (2010) and Jason Dufner (2013) open with bogeys.Scottie Scheffler also enjoyed that miserable Thursday at Oakmont. When the klaxon went to suspend play, he was the clubhouse leader having shot 69. Not half bad around a notoriously difficult track, but doubly impressive seeing he was a 19-year-old amateur at the time. (Never mind that he shot 78 in the second round and missed the cut by a stroke giving it another go the following year, he finished as low amateur at Erin Hills.) Anyway, he’s flown out of the blocks this morning, with birdie at the makeable par-five 10th, another at the par-three 11th, and a third at the par-four 13th. He’s three under through four holes, but only one ahead, because Tony Finau, third at the Open and tied fifth at Augusta last year, has opened with back-to-back birdies at 10 and 11 as well. Hotting up already, and we’re only an hour or so in. Welcome back, major championship golf! God we’ve missed you.No opening hole at a major is ever truly gentle, of course. The old nerves will be clattering away, for a start. Regarding this subject, the first bogey of the 2020 PGA Championship was made by Andrew Landry, the 32-year-old Texan unable to make a sandy save on 1. You may recall Landry leading the 2016 US Open after the first round, shooting a rain-disrupted 66 on Thursday and Friday at Oakmont. Plenty of time to turn it all around and relive past glories.So we begin our coverage with news of the first birdie in a men’s major since Shane Lowry wedged to ten feet on 15 at Portrush, stroked in the putt, then fist-pumped the air, knowing the job was done. It’s made by CT Pan, the 28-year-old Taiwanese whose best finish at this championship is a missed cut last year. He sent his second at Harding Park’s gentle opening hole to six feet from 130 yards. In went the putt, and Pan became the first player to top the leaderboard at the 2020 PGA, albeit as a member of the very first group out. Still, if you’ve led a major, you’ve lead a major. Major championship golf is back, baby! It seems an eternity since Hinako Shibuno sensationally won the Women’s British Open at Woburn one year and two days to be precise. Under normal circumstances, Shane Lowry would have defended his Open title three weeks ago at Sandwich, wrapping up the 2020 major season for the men. But these are far from normal circumstances, and here we are, starting it up right now, four months late, with a tournament for so long known as Glory’s Last Shot. A world turned upside down, huh.It’s been long enough that we may need to remind ourselves of the 2019 winners in the men’s majors. Here’s the roll of honour ...Koepka is looking to become only the second player to win the PGA three times in a row, having held off a resurgent Tiger Woods at Bellerive in 2018, then resisted a Dustin Johnson charge - and his own demons, an unprecedented collapse momentarily looking likely - at Bethpage Black last May. Walter Hagen is the only other man to pull off a three-peat in this tournament in fact he managed four on the spin during the 1920s, when the PGA was a matchplay event. Given how close Koepka came last weekend at the WGC St Jude, there’d be no huge surprise if he pulled this one off. If he does, he’d be the first man to win three in a row at any major since Peter Thomson won his third Open in 1956.Koepka is one of many stellar names with huge hopes of prevailing at Harding Park. Justin Thomas, the new world number one, coming off a win at the WGC St Jude. Tiger Woods, looking for number 16 on a course he’s long enjoyed playing. Jordan Spieth, looking to complete a career grand slam. Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm, Xander Schauffele, Daniel Berger, Tony Finau, Patrick Cantlay and Colin Morikawa, looking to make their major breakthrough. Tyrrell Hatton and Matthew Fitzpatrick, looking to become the first English winner since 1919. Rory McIlroy, looking to end a six-year major drought. Webb Simpson, Jason Day, Michael Thompson and Phil Mickelson, looking to continue their recent resurgence. Big Dustin! Rickie! Phil! Shane! Gary! An outsider in the Beem-Micheel tradition!Of course the public can’t come in - ironically so, given Harding Park, just outside San Francisco, is a municipal - but a television audience is in for some real theatre nonetheless. It’s the first major of the 2020 season! It’ll be historic in all sorts of ways! It’s on!Here are the first-round tee times ...

But I don’t really know any more.18th over: England 58-3 (Root 11, Pope 31) A short ball from Yasir is pulled for four by Pope, who then runs down the track to clip a single through midwicket. As well as the obvious Root comparison, there’s something a bit Thorpeish about this counter-attack from Pope. First-gen Thorpe, that is, from 1993-2001.Root, who is very slowly starting to settle, laps four more round the corner to complete a good over for England.17th over: England 49-3 (Root 7, Pope 26) Pope drives Naseem Shah crisply through the covers for four. “Looks a class player, this Pope,” says Shane Warne on commentary. I doubt he’s said that about too many young England batsmen, on or off mic.16th over: England 44-3 (Root 7, Pope 21) The legspinner Yasir Shah replaces Mohammad Abbas (7-0-24-2), and Pope pulls a loose first delivery round the corner for two. Many people have commented on Pope’s stylistic similarity, rightly so, but his busy, counter-attacking approach is also identical to a young, unburdened Root. Root looks worn down in comparison to Pope and survives a big LBW appeal when he pushes around his front pad. Missing leg. The next ball missed off by a distance, but only because it turned and bounced violently off the straight. That’s exceedingly ominous for England. Root ends an eventful over with a decisive sweep for four, his first boundary from his 47th delivery. Good shot.15th over: England 37-3 (Root 3, Pope 18) Naseem Shah has already hit 90mph. Pope still has enough time to, erm, time a beautiful straight drive for four. He has played quite brilliantly in this short innings.14th over: England 32-3 (Root 3, Pope 12) “Ok,” says Tony Mason. “But your statement, ‘My spine is tingling’, I doubt would have been written if Australia had England 16-3 in the opening test match having posted over 300. Please tell me if I’m wrong.”You’re right – but that’s because of the haal of Pakistan, nothing else. I’m not having that we wouldn’t praise exhilarating cricket by Australia or any of England’s opponents. Pick (almost) any liveblog since the OBO started in 2002 and you’ll see that. Off the top of my head, one example is Adelaide 2006 - probably the most traumatic England defeat of my lifetime, yet I’ve been high on Shane Warne’s heist ever since. Also, my spine was tingling. I don’t choose when that happens I’m not Derren Brown.13th over: England 31-3 (Root 3, Pope 12) The teenage sensation Naseem Shah comes into the attack. He already has a Test hat-trick, at the age of 17 for FFS, and I cannot wait to see him bowl. His second ball is an absurd, trampolining legcutter to Pope, who offers no stroke and joins Naseem in smiling at the freakishness of the delivery.The next ball angles in to thump the pad and prompt a huge LBW appeal. Richard Kettleborough says not out and replays show it was going over the top. Pope gets down the other end thanks to a leg-bye, and then Root is beaten outside off stump. A terrific first over from Naseem, and it’s time for everyone to have a drink.“What are Joe Root’s slowest innings with respect to strike rates? Let’s say minimum of 50 balls,” says Avitaj Mitra. “Can the OBO community help out?” That’s one for the fine folk at CricViz, alas, or maybe Andy Zaltzman on TMS. He’s usually busy at the start of an innings, though, so I’d be surprised if he has been 3 not out from 38 balls before. Maybe against Australia in 2013 or 2013-14, when he was a bit strokeless.12th over: England 30-3 (Root 3, Pope 12) Root is starting to look slightly more comfortable. Okay, slightly less uncomfortable, at least in defence. The runscoring can wait for another day. With Root batting out of his crease to negate Abbas’s movement, Rizwan calls for a helmet and stands up the stumps. Root, back in his crease, inside-edges a good nipbacker for a couple to move to 3 from 37 balls. That wasn’t far away from another LBW.11th over: England 28-3 (Root 1, Pope 12) There are still 25 overs remaining today. Light will probably become an issue but Pakistan have two legspinners they can use. Pope times Shaheen nicely into the stumps at the non-striker’s end and then feathers a cover drive for two. I’ve been so impressed with how he has addressed a situation that would have overwhelmed 99.94 per cent of 22-year-olds. “Would Rob Smyth be as gracious to Australia as he is to Pakistan?” asks Tony Mason. “No. It was the same with the WI. He will claim it is the cricket he is loving but if it was Australia there would be some other reason for their good play. It seems to me that NZ, WI and Pakistan get a different ride with  compared with India, Australia and SA.”Thanks for telling me what I think and feel. Perhaps you could also tell me how I’ve just described you in my internal monologue.10th over: England 26-3 (Root 1, Pope 10) Abbas bowls consecutive no-balls, called by the third umpire, and then Pope clips confidently off the pads to move into double figures. He is the only England batsman so far to look comfortable at the crease. Or the legspinners.And Naseem Shah hasn’t even bowled yet.9th over: England 21-3 (Root 1, Pope 7) Shaheen is switching over and round the wicket to toy with Root, who digs out a superb inswinging yorker. Turns out it was a no-ball. Root doesn’t look comfortable, though, and his sole focus is survival. He’s managing it, just about another torrid over ends with a play and miss at a scrambled-seam legcutter.“Am I correct in my suspicion that a substantial number of Stokes’s dismissals this summer have come when he’s walked down the pitch?” says Robert Ellson. “Two in the first West Indies Test?”You might be right. I have no problem with him batting outside his crease, especially against somebody like Abbas, but maybe being on the move affects his balance slightly. I’ll level with you: I haven’t a clue! But I do know it was a stunning piece of bowling, the moment of the summer so far.8th over: England 20-3 (Root 1, Pope 7) He may lose his off stump any second but this has been an impressive start from Pope, who is trying to put some pressure back on Pakistan. He back cuts Abbas for a couple and then steals a quick single. While it’s not exactly Headingley 81, it takes courage to start with such intent when Pakistan are wreaking havoc. Root then gets off the mark from his 22nd delivery. Meanwhile, if you haven’t read this before, read it. If you’ve read it before, read it.7th over: England 16-3 (Root 0, Pope 4) A maiden from Shaheen to Root, who has nought from 20 balls and is solely intent on trying to survive and reduce the pulse rate of this Test match.6th over: England 16-3 (Root 0, Pope 4) Pope gets off the mark with a thick edge along the ground for four. He’ll learn as much in the next two hours, if he survives that long, as he has in his two years as a Test player.My spine is tingling. Stokes walked down the track to Abbas, who was bowling round the wicket. He saw, or at least sensed, Stokes coming and snapped a monstrous delivery past his defensive stroke to hit the top of off stump. There was an almighty collective yelp of triumph when it hit the stumps, and just for a second - a glorious split-second - it felt like there were 30,000 people in the ground. The human race does not deserve the Pakistan cricket team.4th over: England 12-2 (Root 0, Stokes 0) That dreadful review shows the extent to which England’s collective noggin has gone. Pakistan can this to anyone, though, and their new-ball bowling has been devastatingly good.The new batsman is Ben Stokes, who takes guard well outside his crease in an attempt to reduce Abbas’s LBW threat.“Oh Rob,” says Jezz Nash. “Don’t go teasing us with the 2004 England team. Possibly my favourite ever. Didn’t seem to know you weren’t supposed to chase down significant scores in the fourth innings, and seemed to be having inordinate fun while doing so. ‘Mind the windows, Tino’.”The time of our fuppin life it was.That’s plumb. Pakistan are all over England like a cheap cliche, and now Dom Sibley has gone. It was a textbook Abbas dismissal: perfect length and nipping back to trap Sibley plumb in front. He wasted a review, with Root’s blessing, but replays confirmed it was hitting leg stump three quarters of the way up. 3rd over: England 10-1 (Sibley 6, Root 0) The LBW decision that was overturned came from a big inducker, which Root missed by a fair distance as he tried desperately to defend. He was up on his toes, though, and replays showed it was bouncing over. Shaheen’s follow-up delivery is a stunning yorker that Root just inside-edges onto the pad. He would have been plumb otherwise. This is blistering stuff from Pakistan, and a helluva test of Root’s concentration. By hook or by crook, he needs to get through the first half-hour.Sheesh. It was just bouncing over the stumps and Root survives.Joe Root is out for a duck! He has reviewed it and might just get away with this on height.2nd over: England 10-1 (Sibley 6, Root 0) Mohammad Abbas, the clinical surgeon of this Pakistan attack, shares the new ball. He has an exceptional Test record - 75 wickets at 21 - and has already won Test matches against England and Australia off his own ball. Sibley gets off the mark with a work to leg for two and then thick edges wide of gully for four. Had he missed that, and he almost did, he would have been plumb LBW.“Your point about England all too often losing the first Test of a series doesn’t just apply to cricket,” says Nick Fisher. “I was re-reading George Orwell’s The Lion and the Unicorn, and he says, ‘Probably the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton, but the opening battles of all subsequent wars have been lost there.’ Old Etonians haven’t played much of a part in Test cricket for a while (with apologies to Jonners and Blowers), but I wonder if some of the same dark forces are involved?” 1st over: England 4-1 (Sibley 0, Root 0) The new batsman is the England captain Joe Root, who will do very well not to fail here. He must still have a scrambled mind from an irksome day in the field, and he is batting in a position he doesn’t like.“I believe that the record without a stumping is 27 Tests, by Australia’s Wayne Phillips,” believes Richard O’Hagan. “The difference for Buttler is that England have arguably better spinners than the likes of Bob Holland and Peters Taylor and Sleep (and an occasional bit of Border), so there have probably been more opportunities.”That’s a bit harsh on Mark Taylor.He’s gone! He pushed defensively outside the line of a good delivery that hit him on the knee roll, and replays showed it was hitting middle stump. Pakistan are doing it again!0.4 overs: England 4-0 (Burns 4, Sibley 0) Shaheen Afridi, the left-arm seamer who bowled spectacularly during last year’s World Cup, will take the first over. He has a huge shout for LBW against Rory Burns turned down - but Pakistan have gone for the review. If Burns hasn’t hit this, he’s in bother. “Is it an indictment of England’s spinners or Buttler’s keeping that he has ZERO Test stumpings from 45 Tests (I believe he has kept wicket in 25 of those)?” says Kevin Wilson. “Bairstow at least has 13 from 70 Tests (48 as keeper). I’ll accept that England’s muddled approach to the position hasn’t helped but I’d be interested to know how many he’s muffed.”That’s a helluva spot, especially as – at least from memory – he hasn’t muffed too many. I wonder how many keepers have played as many Tests without a stumping? (Jeff Dujon got five in 81 Tests, since you asked.)As a formula for pulsating Test-match entertainment, Pakistan batting first and scoring between 275-350 is harsd to beat. It’s not necessarily a formula for an England victory, though. The last time they won a Test match when the opposition batted first and scored at least 325 was at Mumbai in 2012. And that needed an innings that was astonishing even by Kevin Pietersen’s standards.England have drawn a few such Tests in the intervening eight years, including one in New Zealand last winter, but they don’t generally respond well to scoreboad pressure. Twasn’t ever thus. Michael Vaughan’s England won five Tests in seven months in 2004 after fielding first and conceding at least 325.That stat, which I accidentally stumbled upon just now, is a perfect reflection of what Marcus Trescothick called ‘the Vaughan principle’: always attack, unless you are in doubt, in which case attack even harder. He was a genius.A strange end to the innings. Naseem Shah gloves a lifter from Broad through to Buttler, and England start to walk off the field. Then Naseem decides to review, so they have to hang around for a bit. Replays show it brushed his thumb on the way through to Buttler.109th over: Pakistan 326-9 (Afridi 9, Naseem 0) Shaheen Afridi, who has batted pretty well for an apparent rabbit, pings Archer off the pads for consecutive boundaries. The first was an attempted knuckle ball that turned into a low full toss.108th over: Pakistan 317-9 (Afridi 1, Naseem 0) The 17-year-old Naseem Shah is beaten first ball, curtain-railing optimistically towards the ball like Courtney Walsh.“Hello Rob,” says Tim Sanders. “In response to Kevin Wilson (101st over), I’d say that Jonny Bairstow in his years of Titanic Test Batting (2015-17ish) might well have fluffed one or two of the chances Joss Buttler has missed. More recently (2018-19) I don’t think he would. However, the problem is that the batting fell away as the ‘keeping got better. To be fair to him, this was at the same time as becoming England’s best-ever ODI opener and World Cup winner, and being moved up the batting order in Tests. Jonny will be playing a couple of Bob Willis Trophy games for Yorkshire, so he’ll finally get a chance to get his first-class cricket batting back in order. Right now I’d pick Ben Foakes.” I’d also make Foakes next in line, as much for my conscience as the fact we’re playing in Asia this winter. But my hunch is that Bairstow will demolish some poor sods out in the Bob Willis Trophy and replace Buttler at some stage, probably the end of the summer. A glorious, career-defining innings comes to an end. Shan got in a bit of a tangle with a Broad inducker and was hit on the back leg. Richard Kettleborough took so long to give the LBW that Broad had already turned round to discuss a review, and produced yet another #Broadface when he realised it was out. Replays showed it was hitting the outside of leg stump, and Shan goes for 156 from 319 balls. He’ll not play better in this lifetime.Pakistan review! Shan Masood has been given out LBW to Broad, and I can’t see this being overturned.105th over: Pakistan 317-8 (Shan 156, Afridi 1) Jofra starts after tea, with a decent chance of a fourth five-for in only 10 Tests. Imagine how good he’ll be when he’s treated properly. Shan Masood turns down a single early in the over but accepts the offer of a boundary with a swivel-pull round the corner.He takes a single later in the over and Shaheen survives an LBW appeal. Missing leg, t’were.That’s a good spot. But I bet Chris Silverwood doesn’t stand in front of a full-length mirror, twisting his neck and staring affectionately at his earthquake-proof derriere.On the plus side, England have a chance to make history in the next few days. If they can pull off a defeat here they will become the first England side in Test history to lose the opening Test of six consecutive series.“Any ideas what Root was thinking by bowling himself and Bess after lunch?” says Andrew Hurley. “He has four front-line quicks, he didn’t need to rest them all, and they were just coming from a lunch break. Very hard to understand...”I can sort of see the thought process – five overs to the second new ball, Woakes and Archer had bowled a fair bit just before lunch, Broad and Anderson were waiting for the second new ball. But it was the wrong match situation and the wrong No7 to do it again, even for five overs. I think it’s another example of Root not having an instinctive feel for captaincy. As my colleague Tim de Lisle put it, it’s a language he doesn’t speak.

Efforts to treat the injured have been hampered by the fact that hospitals are among the damaged buildings.The blast was so powerful it was felt in Cyprus, 120 miles (193 km) away.Lebanon president, Michel Aoun, said 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had been stored unsafely in a warehouse for six years. After an initial blast and fire in the port, it is thought that this was the cause of a second blast, with a massive fireball and white cloud sending a shockwave across the city.Shop and apartment windows were blown out as far away as two miles (3.2 km) from the port, littering the streets with broken glass and causing hundreds of injuries.Video footage shows buildings next to the port area taking heavy damage as the shockwave spread through the city.Beirut’s governor has said that the blast damage extends to over half of the city, and that up to 300,000 people have been left homeless.Rescue teams are searching through debris in several neighbourhoods for missing people, while hospitals are overwhelmed with dealing with thousands of injured.Damage has been confirmed as far away as Beirut airport, six miles (9.5 km) from the blast site. A similar explosion in central London would see damage extend to the areas of Wood Green, Stratford and Forest Hill while the Bronx would have been affected if this happened in central Manhattan.The impact of the explosion can be gauged from aerial images showing the port before and after the blast.

Anger is growing in Lebanon at what appears to be an industrial accident that authorities foresaw and warned about for years before. The Lebanese government is currently investigating, but many in the country and internationally are calling for an independent probe.Exactly what happened at the port in the early evening of 4 August is still unclear, but several facts have come to light in the days since the blast. The trail begins nearly seven years ago, with a rickety ship leaving the eastern European state of Georgia, carrying a deadly load.The Rhosus, a Russian-owned, Moldovan-flagged merchant vessel departs from Batumi, Georgia en route to Mozambique carrying 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate. The bill of lading shows the chemicals were purchased by Fabrica De Explosivos, a Mozambican industrial explosives company.The company that manages the Mozambican port of Beira says it was never notified of any such cargo arriving, according to Portuguese media. According to an interview with the ship’s former captain, the vessel made stops in Turkey and Pireaus, Greece.The Rhosus makes a stop at in Beirut. Some sources suggest it did so due to a technical fault, but the former captain has claimed it wanted to take on extra cargo to make the voyage more profitable. There, the crew went on strike due to unpaid wages, he says. Lebanese authorities refused to let the ship leave, claiming since the explosion they believed it was unseaworthy.But the ship’s former captain has said it was stopped due to unpaid port fees. The International Transport Workers Federation, which sought back wages and repatriation for the crew, confirmed that the ship was being held in part because it owed the port $100,000 in unpaid bills. Some of the crew were not allowed to leave for another 11 months, claiming they were “incarcerated” on the vessel.The then-director of Lebanese customs, Shafik Merhi, sends a letter to an “urgent matters judge” warning of the danger of the ammonium nitrate and asking for a ruling on what should be done with it, Al Jazeera reports.Another letter is sent in December of that year and in May 2015 again asking for a resolution, according to the current Lebanese customs director, Badri Daher.Shipping website FleetMon says the Rhosus has by this point been “abandoned” by its owner.The 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate aboard the Rhosus has by this point been placed in a warehouse and the ship is detained at the port, according to lawyers for the crew, who have since been released from the vessel.It is not known how much longer the empty vessel was kept in Beirut, or where it went afterwards. The ship’s former captain says it sank “two or three years ago”.Lebanese customs officials send three more letters to the judiciary. The latest, sent 27 October 2017, urges the judge to make a quick decision in light of “the danger … of leaving these goods in the place they are, and to those working there”.They claim the letters are ignored and nothing is done.A state security report is submitted to the judiciary, the presidency and the intelligence and customs directorates warning of “the real danger arising from these materials”, according to the Lebanese news outlet Al-Akhbar. It makes several recommendations including that a hole in warehouse 12, where the highly explosive material is being kept, be sealed to prevent theft.An anonymous source close to a port employee told Reuters a team had inspected the ammonium nitrate six months before the explosion and warned that if it was not moved it would “blow up all of Beirut”.Lebanon’s public works minister Michel Najjar learns of the presence of the ammonium nitrate at the port from a report he receive’s from the country’s supreme defence council, he told Al JazeeraA fire is said to be alight at the Beirut port. Its source and exactly where it started is not clear. Lebanese media has quoted the port’s general manager Hossan Koraytem claiming a team of welders was sealing the gap in warehouse 12 and finished their work by noon. Unnamed security sources have claimed the welding crew finished before 5pm.Reuters on Wednesday quoted sources claiming the fire started at nearby warehouse 9 and spread to warehouse 12 – without mention of any welding.Others have observed the sputtering red explosions that preceded the large blast in some videos suggest fireworks might have been the source of the initial fire.At least 10 firefighters are dispatched to the port to put out the fire, which by 5.54pm is sending plumes of thick smoke above Beirut.A massive blast shakes Beirut. One of the first markers of the event on social media is a tweet from Adam Baron, a resident of a neighbourhood close to the port. His tweet appears at 6.09pm. He says he sent it “while I was still cowering, so within a minute” of the explosion.The port is reduced to a deep crater surrounded by a smouldering wasteland, while buildings close to the epicentre of the explosion are severely damaged.Windows are broken and walls caved in up to 5km away, and the blast is heard across Lebanon and more than 200km away in Cyrus.Beirut’s governor, Marwan Abboud, estimates up to $15bn damage has been done to the city and that 300,000 homes are damaged, some left uninhabitable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fabdf9932a25b67c2213d456132d42f9f7745ab5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39a07d8a0608f4fa04e7315395d6fd4e","title":"beirut explosion before and after satellite images","story":"Satellite images show the scale of the damage caused by Tuesday’s explosions in the Lebanese capital, with buildings miles from the port lying in ruin.

By  Shaun Walker My grandfather had never been a tall man, and now he looked absurdly small, no bigger than a child. Swaddled in off-white sheets like a newborn, with just his head and the soles of his feet visible, his eyes were open and mouth disconcertingly agape, as if in surprise. His corpse was slightly raised from the floor, lain atop a rickety wooden stretcher. Beside the body, three priests in white robes intoned in Avestan, the long-dead language of the Zoroastrian scriptures, as a small fire burned in a silver urn in front of them.It was the height of Mumbai’s monsoon season, and the air in the prayer pavilion was heavy with moisture. The occasional cloudburst outside provided no respite from heat or humidity, and the priests cooled themselves with handheld fans that resembled ping-pong bats as they repeated their sonorous chants. The funeral was the first time I had heard Zoroastrian prayers spoken out loud, though I remembered my grandfather over the years murmuring them under his breath multiple times a day, velvet cap on his head and prayer book in his hand. Besides my mother and me, the small group in attendance was mainly made up of frail friends and distant relatives, almost all of them Parsis, as the Zoroastrians of India are known.The cremation came later the same afternoon, the heat from the chrome furnace adding to the stickiness. The body was reduced in a matter of minutes to a kilogram of ashes, which were handed to us the next morning in a knotted sack the size of a coconut. Prayers continued the next day, the extended ceremony providing a map for slowly working through the grief.In the days after the funeral, it struck me with some sadness that my grandfather, who had spent almost a century devoted to the Zoroastrian faith, would be the final Parsi in his family line. Growing up in Britain, I’d read a bit about the history of Zoroastrianism, but only knew the basics: it was one of the oldest religions, based on the teachings of the prophet Zarathustra, who lived thousands of years ago, though nobody knew exactly where or when (Iran, central Asia, perhaps what is now southern Russia and about 1500 BC, give or take a few centuries). The faith he preached, of an epic battle between a powerful deity and an evil spirit, in which his followers should do everything in thoughts, words and deeds to aid the side of light, was passed down orally for centuries before it was committed to parchment. It became the dominant religion of Persia for more than a millennium, until the advent of Islam in the seventh century. Some Zoroastrians who refused to convert fled, and ended up in Gujarat in western India, where they became known as Parsis after their Persian origins. They built new temples to house their sacred fires, which were tended to by priests and could never be extinguished.The Parsis promised their Hindu hosts they would not proselytise, and over the centuries this morphed into a dogmatic aversion to conversion. The rigorous tribalism kept the small community alive and distinct for more than a millennium, but in today’s world, the same intransigence is killing it off. “You’ve seen four weddings and a funeral – well, for Parsis, it’s four funerals and a wedding,” says Jehangir Patel, who has edited the community’s monthly magazine, Parsiana, for almost 50 years. When he finally retires, he fears the magazine will simply close, as more of its readers are dying off each year. India’s Parsi population shrank from 114,000 in 1941 to 57,000 at the last census in 2011. Projections suggest that by the end of the century, there will be just 9,000 left.My grandfather, Pestonjee Pader, was a gentle man with a raucous, childish sense of humour, but not far beneath the surface lurked a sense of tragedy. He liked to tell stories, but most of them ended in one of two ways: “… and then, unfortunately, we had to leave”, or “… and then, tragically, they passed away too soon”. Born into a Parsi family in 1922, he grew up in the Gulf city of Aden, a thriving port then under British rule, which attracted many Parsi traders. After his father died in the late 30s, my grandfather took over the family business, supplying food and other provisions to the ships that docked in Aden on their way between Europe and Asia. He also ran the Long Bar, where he watered thirsty soldiers from the British garrison. He negotiated a concession from Carlsberg, importing beer from Denmark and eventually making a handsome profit. By the mid-60s, he was on the verge of setting up an ice-cream factory, a sure money-maker in the punishing Gulf heat. But the plans fell through when revolution came to southern Yemen in 1967, driving out the British and, by extension, the Parsis, too. My grandparents escaped to Bombay, leaving all but a few suitcases of possessions behind.For my grandfather, the real tragedies were still to come: between 1976 and 1983, he lost his wife and both his sons, leaving my mother as his only surviving child. When we flew out to visit him during school holidays in the 90s, his once-grand apartment on Mumbai’s Malabar Hill felt as if it were occupied by ghosts: a table laid with Carlsberg glasses and coasters, carefully preserved from decades earlier photographs of the deceased on the sideboards. He padded around the too-big apartment, saying Zoroastrian prayers of remembrance for the dead several hours each day, and regularly taking the bus to the fire temple for prayers. In the evenings, he went out for dinner with his mostly Parsi friends, until they, too, started dying off. For as long as I can remember, he would say matter of factly that he was ready to die, but he kept on going, remaining healthy into his late 80s. It was only right at the end, when dementia hit, that he became weak and confused. In summer 2017, the news came that he had finally passed away, shortly after turning 95.My grandfather stuck to his Zoroastrian faith doggedly, whatever obstacles life tossed into his path, but my mother was ejected from the Parsi fold, officially at least, when she married out. She came to London when she was 17, to go to university and then train as an English teacher. She slipped away from a planned marriage to a good Parsi boy, and later married my dad, another teacher from Southampton. Her parents, unlike many other relatives, quickly came to accept the marriage, but the strict community rules meant she was no longer a Parsi. Partly, she accepted this, and partly, she just ignored it. “No religious bigot was going to define who I was,” she told me, and she continued to feel deeply attached to the cultural aspects of being Parsi.Although my family often visited India when I was growing up, my sister and I never learned to speak Gujarati, and there was no suggestion among our Parsi relatives that we should partake in Zoroastrian rituals and ceremonies to feel a sense of belonging to the community, or even that we would be allowed to if we wanted. This wasn’t something I fretted about. I liked the idea of a secret, Zoroastrian side of my identity, but in my studies and then my professional life, I gravitated towards Russia, not India or Zoroastrianism. On visits to Mumbai I felt like much more of an outsider than I did when walking the streets of Moscow, where I made my home as a foreign correspondent.But the funeral stirred in me a new interest in the 3,500-year-old Zoroastrian religion and today’s tiny Parsi community. As the religion’s followers declined, why were Parsis so dogmatic about keeping their doors closed to mixed-heritage children, let alone accepting outside converts? And did this mean that the whole Parsi community was heading for the same fate as my grandfather: a drawn-out but sadly inevitable disappearance?Nearly three years later I found a way to seek some answers: a Return to Roots trip, which took a small group of young Parsis to India for an exploration of their history and culture. The idea was loosely modelled on Birthright Israel, which brings young Jews to the Holy Land, though our version was on a much smaller scale and free of attendant geopolitics.I landed in Mumbai one night in early March, and the next morning the group met for orientation, each of us saying a few words about ourselves and what we hoped for from the next two weeks. Five of the 15 participants were from the dwindling Parsi community of Karachi most of the others were children of Parsi parents who had moved to North America. They were ided between those who had strong connections to the religion and those who had lost touch and wanted to re-engage with it. There was one American-Iranian, whose family came from the small community of Zoroastrians who remained behind in Iran and live there to this day. And then there was me, the only halfie.Arzan Sam Wadia, the Mumbai-born, New York-based architect who runs Return to Roots, had told me that the tour is emphatically not meant to function as a Parsi dating service, but he added immediately that new couples had indeed formed on previous tours, which was a pleasing side-effect. Certainly, on the first morning there was a tangible feeling of excitement at the presence of so many fellow members of that endangered species, the young Parsi. One of the volunteers accompanying us, Sheherazad, a 25-year-old Zoroastrian priest, told us he would be on hand to help with logistics and answer any spiritual questions, for those who had forgotten the prayers and rituals they learned as children (and for me, who never knew them in the first place). With a crop of bleached blond hair and a mischievous smile, he was far from the humourless, conservative figure I expected of a priest. He told us to call him Sherry.After the introductions, we headed to the Towers of Silence, a sprawling expanse of forested land in the heart of downtown Mumbai that takes its name from the stone structures inside the grounds, where the bodies of Zoroastrians are consigned after death. The whole area is closed to the public, and I felt a rush of excitement through my jetlag as our bus passed through the guarded gates, adorned with signs warning off non-Parsis. Herodotus, in the fifth century BC, wrote of Persians exposing their dead to vultures, and 2,500 years later the tradition persists: Parsi corpses are laid out inside the stone towers, also known as dakhmas (in fact, they are shaped more like amphitheatres than towers). The first dakhma was built here in 1670, when big cats roamed what was then a wild forest. Today, the grounds are populated with butterflies, parrots and peacocks, and entering the serene space from the urban cacophony outside is pleasingly jarring.Our guide for the Mumbai leg of the tour was Khojeste Mistree, the intellectual kingpin of orthodox Parsis. Unfailingly polite yet ruthlessly dogmatic, Mistree trained as a chartered accountant before taking up Zoroastrian studies in Britain in the 60s, and later arrived back in India armed with historical knowledge to aid the conservative Parsis who wanted to keep the faith closed.As we walked through the greenery towards one of the two dakhmas currently in use, Mistree exalted the Parsi method of consigning the dead. “It is the best and most ecologically sound way to dispose of a corpse,” he said, explaining that it prevented the earth being polluted with the evil spirits present in a dead body. Mistree told us that each dakhma could hold more than 250 bodies, laid out on slats inside the round stone structures. When the bodies have fully decomposed, corpsebearers push the skeletons into a hole in the middle, though the high walls meant none of this was visible to us.“You’re standing here by this dakhma, and what can you smell?” asked Mistree in his distinctive voice, which drops just a hint of Bombay twang into the soaring cadences of an Oxford don. “That’s right. Nothing. Whatever scurrilous gossip you read in the papers about rotting corpses and so on, it’s nonsense.”As recently as the 80s, hungry vultures had swooped into the dakhmas and picked Parsi corpses clean in a matter of days. Then, in the space of a decade, the birds died out, mainly owing to the use of diclofenac, a drug fed to livestock that poisoned vultures when they fed on the carcasses. Bodies inside the dakhmas were instead left to decompose naturally, which could take several months. On certain days, people living nearby could catch a putrid whiff of decaying human flesh from their windows. In 2006, someone sneaked a camera inside one of the dakhmas and leaked photographs of the gruesome sight online. Even the staunchest advocates of dakhma consignment were horrified, and began thinking up possible solutions. A programme to breed new vultures came to nothing. There was brief excitement at the creation of a specially designed mixture of herbs and chemicals, stuffed into the orifices of the dead, but it was so effective that the dakhma floors became covered in a layer of human slurry, on which the corpsebearers kept slipping, making their unenviable job still more difficult.“I’m sorry to say,” said Mistree, in a tone that was notably unapologetic, “that those Parsis who opt for cremation will go to hell.” Later, he clarified that Parsis who lived abroad could choose alternative methods, though never cremation, as it sullied fire with the evil spirits present in a dead body. But for those who lived in Mumbai, like my grandfather, there was no excuse. In Mistree’s severe reading of Zoroastrianism, a man who had spent most of his 95 years on Earth steeped in prayer, and abiding by the exhortation to good thoughts, words and deeds, had been despatched to hell.The next day, we boarded an open-top double-decker bus for a tour of the religious sites and cultural monuments of Parsi Mumbai, and a lesson about the Parsi influence on India’s history. Mahatma Gandhi’s intellectual mentors? Parsis. Biggest philanthropists of 19th-century India? Parsis. The first underground cinema carpark in India? Built by a Parsi. “It is quite mind-blowing how so few people have given so much,” said Mistree over a microphone, as our bus weaved through the jostle of the streets, above the honking cars and the chink-chink of the machines making juice from sugar cane. We lunched at the Ripon Club, a Parsi dining venue opened in 1884, amid grand portraits and busts of illustrious past members and tables seating a few geriatric current ones.The following morning, in a lecture at Mistree’s apartment, he laid out the basic tenets of Zoroastrianism. I was impressed with its answer to the agnostic’s most vexing question: why, if there is an almighty God, is there so much suffering on earth? The Zoroastrian God, Ahura Mazda, is locked in a permanent battle with Ahriman, an evil spirit. Ahura Mazda is omniscient but not omnipotent, meaning that famine, disease, killings and other evils are not the work of a jealous and vengeful God, but are instead the temporary triumph of Ahriman. Early Zoroastrianism had a great influence on other major religions, and some scholars believe that Jewish eschatology grew out of Zoroastrian thinking. The three wise men of the nativity story are thought to have been Zoroastrian priests.Mistree moved on to the holy fires, which are central to Zoroastrian worship. Creating the “highest grade” of fire requires the merging of 16 separate fires, he told us, including fire from a lightning strike and fire from the house of a king. The resultant super-fire takes 14,000 hours of prayer to consecrate, and can subsequently only be fed with sandalwood. “I was in England when Coventry cathedral was consecrated and the ceremony was only six to eight hours,” he said, pausing for us to savour the comparison. Mistree also spoke of the importance of the sudreh and kusti, an undershirt and belt tied ceremonially while praying, which had to be worn for any visit to a temple. Mistree insisted that to be a “real” Zoroastrian, a person had to wear their sudreh and kusti every day. Because I hadn’t had a navjote – the Zoroastrian coming of age ceremony – I was not eligible to wear them, and thus not permitted to enter any fire temples. (Since a still-contested reform a century ago, children of mixed marriages in which the father is the Parsi can have a navjote and join the fold, but if the mother marries out, it’s game over.)Beneath the zealous adherence to ritual was a basic theology that seemed both simple and admirable. Zoroastrianism does not prize concepts such as guilt, martyrdom or asceticism. There is, instead, an obligation to work hard, make money, enjoy the proceeds and give generously. “Fasting is a sin. Being unproductive is a sin,” said Mistree. “To be spiritual you have to purposefully generate wealth, do it honestly and then share it.”The exhortation to make money perhaps helps explain why many Parsis have been so successful in the world of business. My grandfather would speak about the work of lawyers and accountants with a note of wonder in his voice that some might reserve for spectacular works of art. “He is good with money” was perhaps his ultimate compliment. The most famous of the historical Parsi entrepreneurs was Jamsetji Tata, who was born into a poor family of Parsi priests in Gujarat in 1839, made his first money in the opium trade, and eventually became one of the 19th century’s most prominent industrialists and philanthropists. His holdings went on to become Tata Group, which today is one of the world’s largest companies.Our tour group was granted an audience with Jamsetji’s 82-year-old great-grandson Ratan Tata, who spent more than two decades as chair of the group and still runs its charitable trusts. One afternoon, we drove to an office block in Mumbai’s business district and filed into a meeting room inside. Tata entered soon after, stooped and hesitant, his wavy grey hair in a side parting. Sitting below a portrait of his ancestors, he spoke to us for an hour. He was delighted that we were taking an interest in our Zoroastrian roots, and described his vision of a typical Parsi as “happy and joyful rather than revengeful and destructive”. Yet Tata seemed to have a pall of sadness over him, I thought, as he reflected on his own history as part of the community. When an earnest member of our group asked him to recount a time when his faith had positively influenced his life, he spoke instead of his escape from his overbearing Parsi family to the US, where he was able to study architecture and finally felt free and happy, before he was dragged back to India to be installed in the family business.The evening before, we had paid a house call on Jimmy Mistry, a Parsi hotelier and bon vivant whose exuberance could hardly be more at odds with Tata’s melancholy, understated vibe. Mistry had built himself an ostentatious tower block in the suburb of Dadar, and had decorated its soaring exterior with oversized motifs of winged lions and bearded warriors, in homage to the grand ruins of Persepolis in Iran, the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid empire, whose dominant religion was Zoroastrianism. On the ground floor of Mistry’s block, there was a newly built fire temple, where our group stopped for a prayer. As this was a private temple, the fire had not been consecrated and so it was a rare case when, as a non-Parsi, I was allowed to enter. But as I went to fix a head-covering, copying the others in the group, Sherry, our young priest companion, accosted me. “It’s better if you wait outside,” he said firmly. I sat alone in a wicker chair, listening to the lilting intonations of the priest waft from the temple without being able to see a thing.After the half-hour of prayer, we ascended in a lift and emerged into a dining room on the 19th floor, where a glass sculpture of a horse was suspended from the ceiling. A husky wearing a jewelled cravat padded across the chequered marble floor to greet us, and then came the host, wearing a tight black T-shirt and Louis Vuitton loafers. “Welcome to my humble abode,” Mistry said with a grin. We stepped on to a roof terrace just in time for the hazy sunset, and were then ushered up a floor to yet another terrace, where we chatted with Mistry and his family over canapes. It was a disgrace, he said, that there were so many rich Parsi businessmen who were not following the Zoroastrian command to spread their wealth. “Enough of silent charity, tell us what the fuck you’ve done for the community! We need to start shaming people,” he said. I asked him how money could help reverse the decline in the Parsi population. What about taking a more inclusive line on who can be a Parsi? “Patrilineality is the only thing that has saved us over the centuries and allowed us to keep our identity,” he said, as the city darkened below.Our programme in Mumbai came to an end, and we left early in the morning for the hill station of Lonavala. Mistry had organised a team-building exercise for us at a retreat he owned, where corporate executives receive military-style counter-terrorism training. After a bumpy hour in a jeep and then a short boat ride, we arrived at the luxury bootcamp, where the rooms had Kalashnikov lamp-stands and hand-grenade door handles, as well as Mistryisms engraved into various fixtures. “‘A gun is like a woman: it’s all about how you hold her’ – Jimmy Mistry” was etched into my bedside table. As the sun set, we were told to stand to attention as the national anthem played, and then the staff handed out fatigues to change into for the exercises, which I decided to skip, feeling a little queasy at the militarism. A billboard informed guests that the complex had been set up to help Indians take revenge for the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which Pakistani gunmen killed more than 150 people.This kind of patriotism has helped the Parsis to remain unscathed as India’s turn towards Hindu extremism intensifies under prime minister Narendra Modi. “Their love is without condition, without any expectation, and therefore the purest possible,” Modi said back in 2011, when he was still chief minister of Gujarat, suggesting that the Parsis were a model minority that others would do well to follow. Money has also helped: the Tata group has been the most lavish donor to Modi’s BJP party in recent years, with one of the Tata trusts giving 3.6bn rupees (£36.2m) in the 2018-19 financial year. The Parsis have long prided themselves on being able to get along with the rulers of the day, whoever they may be, and even the Parsi origin story reflects this knack for astute political messaging. When the refugees from Persia landed, so the tale goes, the Hindu king of Gujarat produced a full glass of milk, to signal that there was no space for new arrivals. The Persians stirred a spoonful of sugar into the milk without spilling any, to show they would sweeten the kingdom without disturbing it.For the second half of our tour, we journeyed north to Gujarat. One of our first stops was Sanjan, the port where our ancestors arrived more than 1,000 years ago. A hot wind buffeted us as Sherry led a brief prayer on the sandy banks of the Varoli river, at the spot where the arriving Persians may or may not have produced that spoonful of sugar, and then we continued further north.There was an energy and excitement inside our tour bus during the long journeys of the next few days, despite the unavoidable theme of ageing and decay that marked much of the trip. We played raucous games of Mafia and danced in the aisle to songs blasted through a bluetooth speaker. Sherry was a ringleader in both the card games and the dancing, rallying the troops and wiggling his hips to the music. A popular choice was Bohemian Rhapsody, sung by the most famous Parsi of them all, Farrokh Bulsara. Born to Parsi parents from Gujarat who resettled in Zanzibar for business, Bulsara went to school near Mumbai, moved to Britain in 1964 and soon took the name Freddie Mercury. He was quietly ignored by much of the community owing to his life choices and sexuality – I remember once perusing a book of 100 Famous Parsis at a relative’s house and finding multiple bridge construction engineers, but no Freddie Mercury – but the young diaspora Parsis on the bus had no qualms in claiming him as one of their own.I started to ponder the idea of having a late-in-life navjote, egged on by many of the friendly co-participants in the tour, who thought it would be a fun excuse to all meet up again. I floated the idea with Sherry, but as we got chatting on the bus, I quickly realised I had been mistaken to infer from his bleached hair and carefree demeanour that he was a reformer and would approve of the idea. In Zoroastrianism, there is no need to be ascetic or severe in order to be conservative. Sherry told me that if either parent was not a Parsi, the child was not one either, and he would not perform a navjote. He did not even accept the century-old ruling allowing navjotes for those children who have just a Parsi father. It seemed odd, given that Sherry was clearly devoted to the community’s survival, and spoke with visible passion about his work as a priest. Wasn’t this kind of attitude hastening its decline? “We want to focus on quality, not just quantity,” he said.I pointed out to him that there were many people on our tour who might end up marrying non-Parsis. Was it really necessary to kick them and their offspring out of the religion? “They know what they’re getting into,” he said, in a tone that brooked no further discussion. Sherry combined a fervent commitment to religious dogma and ritual with a remarkably warm, laid-back attitude to just about every other aspect of life. It was a curious combination, but one I came to recognise in many Parsis we met.We arrived late one evening in Udvada, the small Gujarat town that houses the holiest fire in all Zoroastrianism, the Iranshah. Laying eyes on the Iranshah was set to be the highlight of the tour for most of the group. If legend is to be believed, the fire was consecrated shortly after the arrival of the Parsis in India, and has been burning constantly for more than a millennium. The current temple that houses it dates from the 1740s, and before priests are allowed to conduct prayer ceremonies there, they must undergo a nine-day purification ritual, during which they can have no human contact. The narrow lanes that make up the centre of old Udvada are lined with once-spectacular Parsi mansions now mostly fallen into disrepair. Just a handful of Parsi families still live in the town, though there are a number of inns for the pilgrims who come regularly from Mumbai and across the world. We checked into one of them, which had simple rooms that were bare save for a bed, a ceiling fan and a small representation of Zarathustra on the wall.The next day, while everyone else went to take the requisite pre-prayer shower, I paid a visit to Khurshed Dastoor, the Iranshah’s high priest. He lived across from the temple, in a villa with windows open to the street, through which he was visible sitting at a desk, dressed in white. Dastoor beckoned me into his home with a flick of the wrist. He had a week of beard, and meaty earlobes that reminded me of my grandfather’s. Now 57, he had undergone priestly training at the same time as studying business and economics in Mumbai. On the wall were portraits of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather, and he could trace his lineage back 21 generations, all of them high priests of the Iranshah fire. He took up the role in 2002, when his father died. “Sometimes I thought I didn’t want to do it, but then I realised I had no choice. I think if you are born into this kind of family, you’re stamped that you will become a priest,” he said, brushing away persistent mosquitoes as he spoke.Dastoor told me that nowhere in the Zoroastrian texts does it say children from mixed families should not be allowed to be Zoroastrians. When I asked him about Mistree’s assertion that people like my grandfather who chose to be cremated would go to hell, he became irate. “This is where we’ve gone wrong as a religion,” he said. He told me that while he would personally prefer to be consigned to a dakhma, adherence to ritual and dogma was a secondary concern: “The improvement of your soul, ideas, the kindness you show to people, to help educate and show charity to your family, your whole community and all of society – this is how we should measure a good Zoroastrian.”I was pleasantly surprised to find that one of the religion’s highest priests was a reformer. I asked him whether, if I did decide to have a navjote from a liberal priest, I would be allowed into his temple to see the Iranshah fire. He shook his head, with perhaps a hint of regret. He was bound by the regulations of the town’s nine-priest council, and while he was open to discussing all kinds of reform, the votes were always eight to one against him. Even his mild utterances in favour of change had got him “in a soup” with traditionalists, he said.Still, he was adamant that the community would need to make serious changes if it was going to survive. But what, exactly? He sighed. “If I said conversion, I would be torn down. It’s not the right time and not the right place. But we have to think of something. Though, to be honest, I doubt we can make a difference. I don’t see any optimistic future.”There was something inspiring about the people we had met who were upholding a tradition that went back more than three millennia. I felt proud of my connection to this heritage, and a little deflated that I could never become a “real” Parsi. Still, it was hardly devastating for someone who had not previously felt a strong connection to the community. I was more interested how some of the others on the trip felt, especially the women. They had grown up practising the religion, had been interested enough to come on this trip, and were being told they would be kicked out if they married out. Many said they would prefer to marry a Parsi, but most accepted this was unlikely, given how few they met in their normal lives. Our tour had not, as far as my sleuthing could detect, resulted in the formation of any new Zoroastrian couples.“It’s very sad, but it’s only in India,” said Tanya, a 28-year-old film-maker, born in Karachi and raised in Toronto, on being told she was no longer a Parsi if she married out. While she was proud of both her Zoroastrian faith and her Parsi heritage, she thought it absurd to insist that the Parsis should be the religion’s only gatekeepers. In the diaspora communities of North America, fire temples are open to everyone, and there is no controversy over navjotes for children of mixed parentage, she told me. The small community of Iranian Zoroastrians is even more liberal, allowing female priests, and there are also nascent neo-Zoroastrian movements in parts of the Middle East. “Zoroastrianism will always be there, it doesn’t need a race to exist,” she said. “I’d rather the religion flourishes and moves on and affects people positively than it’s a secret club you are born into.”As the tour approached its end, we visited Navsari, the city from which the Tata family originated, and where both of my Parsi great-grandmothers were born and raised. We stopped at a library that housed ancient Persian and Gujarati Zoroastrian texts, the grand reading room adorned with portraits of illustrious Parsis of yore. We also stopped at the Vadi Daremeher, a seminary that has trained Parsi priests for nearly nine centuries, but no longer has any students.On my last day before leaving India, I met with the Parsi leader Dinshaw Tamboly, who has long been an outspoken reformist voice, and was the driving force behind the creation of the prayer hall and crematorium where my grandfather’s funeral had taken place. He wanted to be cremated when he died, he told me, and was adamant that new voices would win out over traditionalists in the end. As we spoke, his phone flickered into life with an urgent message. An elderly priest in Mumbai had accidentally set himself on fire while praying in his fire temple, and died.The news made me think about two elderly priests I had met a couple of days earlier, when we hopped off the bus at Nargol, a coastal town where the formerly sizeable Parsi population has dwindled to just a few families. Darabshaw Govadia was 86 and could barely walk he was helped by his brother Rusi, a former bus driver who, at 80, was marginally sprightlier. Both priests were living inside the local temple, a handsome yellow structure with a sloping roof and fringed with lush greenery. They tended the fire throughout the day and night, always wearing their billowing white robes and receiving their meals from the town in tiffin boxes. They told me they had just a few visitors each day.I asked who would replace them when they were no longer physically able to perform their duties. “We don’t know,” said Darabshaw in a croaky whisper. We concluded our stilted chat as the rest of the group emerged from saying their prayers, and we all assembled around the brothers on the steps of the temple for a group photograph. Then, it was time for us to leave. The two brothers smiled faintly in farewell, and shuffled back into the temple, to resume the prayers at their sacred flame. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3855bcff6c436d0dfe5ae1826dbc41bdffb1a555/0_130_2324_1394/master/2324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=073567acb5c5bc3ef30458fd3c11238d","title":"pope appoints six women to top roles on vatican council in progressive step","story":"Former Labour minister Ruth Kelly is among the women who will oversee Vatican finances and address its cashflow problemsPope Francis has appointed six women to oversee the Vatican’s finances including Ruth Kelly, the former Labour minister, in the most senior roles ever given to women within the Catholic church’s leadership.The appointments mark the most significant step by Francis to fulfil his promise of placing women in top positions.

The only layman on the council is Alberto Minali, a former director general at Generali, the Italian insurance company.The appointments come as the Vatican struggles with its finances, with problems worsened by the coronavirus pandemic and a sharp drop in the number of visitors to the Vatican Museums, a cash cow for the Holy See.Francis created the Council for the Economy in 2014. “It is essentially the board of surveillance for everything financial within the Vatican, with the only person above it being Pope Francis,” said McElwee.Other women who have obtained prominent positions during Francis’ papacy include Barbara Jatta, who heads up the Vatican Museums, and Francesca Di Giovanni, the undersecretary of the Vatican’s secretariat of state.Kelly, 52, was an economics correspondent for the  for four years in the 1990s, and went on to hold a number of cabinet posts and ministerial positions in Labour governments under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, heading up the departments of education, transport, and communities and local government. In the latter role she was also the women’s minister.At the age of 36, she was the youngest woman to sit in a British cabinet. But Blair’s surprise appointment of Kelly to be education secretary ruffled feathers among colleagues who believed others were better qualified. She had four children – the first born 11 days after the 1997 election – in her first five years as an MP.Her devout Catholicism and membership of Opus Dei – a secretive, highly conservative and influential group within the Roman Catholic church – antagonised campaigners for women’s and LGBT rights. She rejected calls to break with the group, saying: “It is a private spiritual life and I don’t think it is relevant to my job.”But she ruled out working at the Department of Health because of her opposition to abortion, and at the Department for International Development because it promoted the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIVAids.She also came under fire for sending her son, who had dyslexia, to a £15,000-a-year private school.Kelly resigned from the cabinet in 2008, saying she wanted to spend more time with her family, and she did not stand in the 2010 election. She joined HSBC, and moved in 2015 to St Mary’s University, Twickenham.Farrer, 65, spent seven years as treasurer to the Prince of Wales, and before that worked for KPMG. Since leaving the royal household she has held a number of non-executive directorships, including at the Institute for the Works of Religion, more commonly known as the Vatican bank."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18c45b0a6f3f233795fe8d604d7723dd15fea23f/575_793_6145_3687/master/6145.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=15e4ae897c30acf12180013cc616ba44","title":"why cant i be legal anywhere exploited and left stateless by sweden","story":"Rahman arrived as an unaccompanied minor. Abused and deported, his future is uncertain but his European dream intactRahman was out buying food when Spanish police handed him a €500 fine for breaking coronavirus restrictions. “I’ll pay this as soon as I get a residence permit,” he told them. He laughs as he recalls the incident. “Look how thin I’ve become, I weigh only 57 kilos,” he says. The 21-year-old Palestinian shows his skinny 5ft 7in frame over the webcam.He speaks in Swedish mixed with Norwegian expressions – his capacity in both languages is testament to the nearly five years spent between the countries as an adolescent. They were formative years, where he learned that even apparently kind gestures such as the offer of a place to stay could open the door to unfathomable cruelty.It was a time when no matter what Rahman suffered, the legal right to remain in Europe eluded him. His lack of status enabled appalling crimes to be committed against him, and it left the criminals unpunished. He has been exploited and deported but his dream of Europe endures. He has found his way back to the continent but the future is uncertain.In October 2013, 15-year-old Rahman arrived in Sweden alone. Like so many other young refugees, he had heard good things about Sweden: children are protected, they get to attend school and feel safe, their rights are respected and almost all get to stay.He grew up in Jordan, his Palestinian parents refugees from Gaza. Jordan’s citizenship laws had no place for Rahman, leaving him stateless. When the war in Syria was in its third year, his father wanted to send him across the border to fight the Syrian regime. His mother disagreed and the teenager fled to what she hoped would be a place of safety.In Sweden, Rahman lived in a refugee shelter, started school and quickly learned the language. He played football in his spare time. But despite his young age and troubles in Jordan, the court of migration in Stockholm rejected his asylum application in the summer of 2014.With no idea of what to do, Rahman left the youth hostel in Stockholm to avoid being deported, and cut off contact with his state-appointed .That is when he met Martin: a man in his 30s, with a shaved head and heavy gold chains around his neck. Once Martin understood Rahman’s situation, he invited him to a flat in central Stockholm.When he got there Rahman was shocked. Some people were sniffing glue, others were using cocaine. He was given a drink – his first taste of alcohol. The night became a haze. Martin took him into a room. Rahman was struck to the ground and felt hands on his body.The rapes and beatings continued for months. Martin threatened to kill him if he tried to run away. Rahman had seen guns and knives around the flat and did not dare argue or ask questions. “I had nowhere to go. No money. And there was no one to help me,” he says.A lot of people came to the flat, and it was Rahman’s job to keep it clean. He was given takeaway food and drugs. Martin would call at any hour and send him off with a bag and address to deliver it to. He was sent on drug trips across Europe, for which he was given new clothes, a fake passport and a bag to carry. Rahman, usually on drugs, slept through the flights.He is among thousands of children who have come to Sweden in recent years only to go missing when their European dreams are shattered. According to the Swedish migration agency, 2,014 unaccompanied minors are missing without trace since 2013 – equivalent to almost 70 school classes. The threat of deportation is often mentioned as a reason for these disappearances, as is human trafficking.But no one really knows, because no one is searching for them. The police keep records but often do not actively search for the children. Municipalities say children no longer resident in their area are not their responsibility. The migration agency says it cannot examine the cases of missing children. In 2016, the UN human rights committee criticised Sweden for failing to prevent these disappearances.Many, like Rahman, are vulnerable to abuse and traffickers. According to a 2015 survey by a Swedish government agency, most suspected child trafficking cases involved unaccompanied minors. At that time, no trafficking investigations involving unaccompanied minors had resulted in a prosecution.To understand where the system was failing, I researched every suspected case of trafficking of minors in Sweden during a four-year period up to 2015. According to police reports and preliminary investigations, more than half of the cases involved sexual slavery, in which nearly half of the victims were boys. The police’s failed response to trafficking was systemic.Rahman was one of those cases. I tracked him down in Norway. After several months, he had managed to escape Martin. On reaching Norway, he again applied for asylum and reported his experience of trafficking to authorities. Rahman and his lawyer felt the authorities did not take his case seriously. Because the alleged trafficking took place in Sweden, Norwegian police passed the investigation to their Swedish colleagues. Rahman did not trust the investigators in either country. They did not seem to realise how dangerous it would be for him to single out Martin with no witness protection.Shortly after Rahman turned 18, we spent a few days at a seaside resort. Surrounded by glittering Norwegian fjords, he and his court-appointed  sat outside on a mild summer evening. He leaned against her with his big ragged hair and gentle smile. “She’s like a mother to me,” he said.The Swedish trafficking investigation was eventually dropped. His asylum application in Norway was also rejected. Now 18, he was no longer technically a child. In the summer of 2018, he was deported to Jordan.After nearly five years in Europe, Rahman struggled with the more socially controlled society in Jordan. He could not return to his strictly religious family: he now smoked, drank alcohol and wore an earring. Without a Jordanian ID, he had no access to medical care or hope of returning to education.The police seemed to relish harassing him. They would ask: why were you in Europe? Why have you come back? He was even mocked by friends and relatives: where’s the money, the success, the expensive things? For a while he worked 12-hour days at a tourist bazaar for wages that did not cover his rent. After a few weeks he decided to leave again.First he attempted to sail to Greece via Turkey but the yellow dinghy was stopped by Turkish coastguards. After a month and a half in a Turkish prison, he returned to Jordan. He had a Norwegian girlfriend at the time. As a European, she could come to visit for a few weeks. Rahman has none of these options.His friends in Norway arranged for him to stay with people they knew in Kosovo and he planned to continue overland further into Europe. But he was arrested in Montenegro and sent back to Kosovo. He became severely ill and returned to Jordan. But he was already making new plans to reach Europe.“I can’t build a life here,” he said in the summer of 2019. “I want to go to Europe again. I am never giving up.”This time he went to Morocco. Rahman knew this was his most dangerous journey so far. “But I am going to make it, I am sure of it,” he insisted. Later that summer, he reached the Moroccan border with the Spanish enclave of Melilla.This gateway to Europe is marked with high razor wire fences and monitored by drones. Migrants and Moroccan boys his age were everywhere, hoping to get through the border at night. Some had been trying for months, even years. Rahman’s plan was to swim around the sea fences, a treacherous feat as border guards sometimes fire plastic bullets at swimmers. His first four attempts failed and he was hurt in a fall before he finally managed to swim into the port of Melilla.“I am so happy – I am in Europe again!” he said in a message.Afraid of being forced back to Morocco, he stowed away onboard a cargo ship to mainland Spain. He was given a place in a refugee shelter and €50 a month to live on. But this assistance was cut after six months, just as the coronavirus pandemic hit Europe.As we kept in touch over the years, I would always ask how he was and he always replied: “Good,” no matter the circumstances. He has to stay positive, he says, to keep going towards what he longs for: an ordinary life, with a home. He would like to study languages and maybe work with tourists as he is so used to meeting new people.But there is little space to talk about the future right now. Rahman does not even know what tomorrow will bring, where he will sleep or how he will eat. He is considering two unwanted options: start selling drugs again or commit a crime deliberately to get caught. “If I get arrested, I have somewhere to live until corona is over,” he said.Rahman’s European dream has brought him back. Despite the trials he has gone through, the stateless boy is now a young man but no closer to having papers. The asylum process in Spain is long, up to 18 months, and uncertain – and that was before the pandemic. He thinks of Sweden or Norway but doubts his chances. From Scandinavia to Jordan, he has never been granted the right to belong. “Why is that?” he asks. “Why can’t I be legal anywhere?”Rahman’s name has been changed and his photograph in the main image obscured to protect his identity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ced2c704e664950358a777bd4f27113ef711479b/0_107_5368_3221/master/5368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc00cb0fb79c4668b9d54aa9f1a7545","title":"beirut explosion aftermath lebanon in pictures","story":"Lebanon is in mourning and surveying the damage to its capital, Beirut, after a massive explosion ripped through the city’s port and surrounding areas on Tuesday.

Despite Boris Johnson’s continuing to insist the system in England is “world beating”, the consensus is that the government must do better (see. 3.33pm). Prof Sheila Bird, formerly programme leader, MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, said: Is language a barrier or age-group (extreme youth or being very old) or illness and why does Test and trace not enlist the help of the index case or - as recommended by the Royal Statistical Society – select a random sample of index-case households to be visited on a random day (or pair of days) during the household’s quarantine for swab-testing to be offered. Prime minister, any world-beating Test \u0026amp Trace system should inform us, the public, how many tested positive during or soon after their quarantine period who belonged to T\u0026ampT’s two high-risk groups (a) member of the household of symptomatic index case (b) identified external close contact of a symptomatic case. Any world-beating Test \u0026amp Trace system should also be designed to learn about asymptomatic infections in those two high-risk groups and be able to document adherence to quarantine.Eivor Oborn, professor of health care management, Warwick Business School, University of Warwick, said:There is also a slight decline in being able to reach and isolate the contacts of those who test positive. In this sense the system for testing and tracing does not seem to be improving.Dr Joshua Moon, research fellow in the science policy research unit (SPRU) at the University of Sussex Business School, said the results were “not a great sign if we’re serious about keeping the virus under control in the UK”. He added: Over the nine weeks of NHS T\u0026ampT activity, the percentage of non-household contacts has been increasing, indicating that the changes are likely to be as a result of the government’s decision to relax lockdown measures.Clusters of Covid-19 infections have been identified in the Yorkshire city of Leeds, concentrated in and around the Kirkstall and Harehills neighbourhoods.The council said the city’s seven day rate has also been gradually increasing from 4.1 cases per 100,000 people early last week to 13.3 as of 5 August.Leeds was not subjected to enhanced lockdown restrictions last Thursday, unlike neighbouring Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees.But the council is now taking preventative steps in an effort to stop further escalation of cases and to stay on top of community transmission, including sending mobile testing units to affected areas.Councillor Judith Blake, leader of Leeds city council and chair of the Leeds Outbreak Control Board, said: Our outbreak planning has meant we’ve been able to identify these clusters early and intervene quickly, so it’s our hope that by working closely with people living in these areas, we can manage and contain these cases and prevent a wider outbreak.But we can’t do that alone and it’s absolutely imperative that residents play their part by following the latest advice, including avoiding gathering in large numbers, maintaining social distancing, wearing face masks when required, regularly washing their hands and by getting tested and isolating if they have symptoms.The number of people who have died in the UK after a positive test for Covid-19 has increased by 49 from the previous day to 46,413, according to the government’s official death toll. The latest Office for National Statistics count says 56,600 deaths have been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.Nine Conservative MPs in Greater Manchester have written a letter to the health secretary demanding “a more sophisticated approach” to local lockdowns, criticising the government’s “crude and ineffective strategy”.The whole region of 2.8 million people was put back into partial lockdown last Thursday after infections started to rise. The decision prompted unhappiness in some areas of Greater Manchester where rates remained low, for example in Wigan and Bury.The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has rejected the idea of releasing some of the 10 boroughs before others. But the Tory MPs reject this “one size fits all” approach, which they say “risks spreading resources too thinly across the whole conurbation, including in areas with few or no cases”. They say Burnham fails to understand local infection patterns in seeking to “impose a crude and ineffective strategy across the whole area”.They say: Measures must be taken on a borough by borough basis and on a town by town basis in boroughs where there are only one or two coronavirus ‘hotspots’, but the rates in other parts of the borough are low ...Failing to properly target resources, meaning inadequate measures in some places where the problems are greatest, and wasting resources where none are currently needed risks a wider outbreak across Greater Manchester, will only lead to more stringent ‘full lockdown’ measures being imposed as in Leicester. We must strive to avoid this at all costs.The latter is signed byJames Grundy (Leigh)Sir Graham Brady (Altrincham and Sale West)James Daly (Bury North)Christian Wakeford (Bury South)Chris Clarkson (Heywood and Middleton)Chris Green (Bolton West and Atherton)Mark Logan (Bolton North East)Mary Robinson (Cheadle)William Wragg (Hazel Grove)Five clusters have been identified in Northern Ireland over the past seven days with 35 associated cases and 239 close contacts, according to the Public Health Agency (PHA).Dr Gerry Waldron, head of health protection at the PHA, said: This should act as a timely reminder that we must not become complacent - coronavirus remains in circulation and we have seen an increase in cases in recent weeks. It is therefore essential that we remember the key advice to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get tested if you display any symptoms of coronavirus.The PHA said there had been 23 clusters identified in Northern Ireland since 25 May, when the test-and-trace programme went live, 11 of which remain open.Some 168 cases of Covid-19 have been associated with these clusters, with nine of the clusters having had five or more cases associated with them.Earlier this week, two businesses in Newcastle, Co Down, closed temporarily following outbreaks among their staff.The statement from the PHA came as the Department of Health’s daily updates showed 43 more positive cases of coronavirus have been detected in the region, bringing the total to 6,049.No new deaths were recorded, leaving the total in the region at 556, according to departmental figures.The PHA has defined a cluster as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a 14-day period.Key settings that have recorded a cluster include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. However, the PHA said the transmission risk was highest in a household setting.The Department of Health said the R number was now “highly likely” to be above 1 in Northern Ireland.The current estimate for the R value is between 0.8 and 1.8. R represents the number of iniduals who, on average, will be infected by a person with the virus.A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said while community transmission remained low in Northern Ireland, the number of positive tests per day had increased threefold from early July.The number of new coronavirus cases in the UK is still rising with another 950 cases reported as of 9am this morning, according to the latest official daily figures.This is an increase on the 892 new cases reported on Wednesday and above the daily average of 820 reported yesterday. The rate has been rising since dropping to a four-month low of 546 almost a month ago. Some reaction to Johnson’s insistence that our test-and-trace system is still “world beating”: On the new planning shakeup, Johnson added:It’s long overdue because we’ve got a fantastic homebuilding industry with fantastic builders who do a great job. But for some reason or other, and planning has a lot to do with it, it takes far too long to build a home in this country, and they’re way way too expensive, by comparison with France, Germany wherever. They build many more homes per capita and that’s unfair on the younger generation who find themselves excluded from getting onto the property, excluded from any chance of having the home that they need in a good time. What we’re proposing to do are measures which will certainly mean that you continue to have beautiful homes. In fact we’re going to put more conditions in for beauty, for space standards, so that people have fantastic homes to live in. But also, we’ve got to move this thing onwards faster and get good projects going in a more timely way. It’s giving local people more powers to get good projects done faster. And that will be for the benefit of millions of younger people who at the moment find that they’re just unable to get the housing that would make such a huge difference to their lives.Johnson also insisted that the government’s test and trace system was still “world beating” despite data showing that fewer contacts are being followed up. He said: It certainly does fit that description as world beating because I think I’m right in saying that we are now testing more per head of population than virtually any other country in Europe certainly. In America, they’re testing a huge number of people. That test and trace system is absolutely crucial for our ability to fight the disease, and it is working. If you look at what we’re doing with some of the other local social distancing measures that we’re bringing back in, that’s entirely driven by our ability to detect cases, through local test and trace, working with local authorities and taking the right local measures. And that is how we hope that we’ll be able to keep the lid on the disease. What it also takes, of course, is everybody remembers the mantra: ‘hands, face, space’. Wash your hands cover your face if you’re in a shop or on public transport and maintain social distancing. Plus: get a test if you think you’ve got symptoms. And that will really, really help us to continue to control this disease. Speaking on a tour of new housing estate in Warrington, Johnson also expressed concern about news that a new consignment of 50m facemasks was unfit for use.I’m very disappointed that any consignment of PPE should turn out not to be fit for purpose. But overall, don’t forget what we have achieved a colossal race against time to produce billions of items of PPE sourcing them from abroad but now increasingly, making them here in the UK as well, and stockpiling them now in case we have a second wave in in the autumn and the winter.Boris Johnson has defended the Conservative party’s decision not to suspend the MP and former minister who is accused of rape.Asked by Sky News why the party had not suspended the MP, Johnson said:I think it’s very very important that we take all these cases, extremely seriously and will continue to do so I think we’ve got to wait for the police to decide whether they want to make charges and and take a decision on that basis.

Photograph: iStockThird level students will have to wear face coverings during lectures if they are sitting between one and two metres apart, new guidance has recommended.Recommendations which seek to ensure the safe resumption of on-campus activity in the Autumn, the Implementation Guidelines for Public Health Measures in HEIs (Higher Education Institutes), were published byMinister for Higher Education Simon Harris on Wednesday .The guidance, which was drawn up by senior public health experts within the sector and endorsed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, suggests a number of methods to prevent the spread of Covid-19 on education campuses.It recommends that a physical distance of two metres during lectures should be maintained where possible. However, it acknowledges there are situations where tuition can only be “realistically” delivered with less than two metres - but no less than one metre - distancing between students. In those instances, face coverings should be worn, the guidance states.In the event that tuition requires the staff member to be less than two metres from students, the staff member should wear face shields, visors or other protective equipment which will be provided by the college or university.The maximum number of people allowed in a class will be 50, under the current public health advice relating to indoor gatherings. However, the guidance states this may change in accordance with the evolving Covid-19 situation nationally.The guidance has also recommended that colleges develop one-way systems to enter and exit indoor spaces and that additional time should be allocated for this to prevent congestion.HEIs are also advised to control access to student accommodation. Students should not visit buildings other than the one where they live and should not invite guests to the residences. Students who are not residents in college accommodation should not access the buildings, the guidance states.The document also suggests that alternative residential space for students who develop Covid-19 symptoms may be required to prevent the spread of the virus in communal accommodation complexes.The public health guidelines does not put any maximum time limit on the length of a teaching session, however it does highlight that if people spend two or more hours in a shared space together, they may be regarded as Covid-19 contacts in the event that someone present subsequently tests positive.After each group leaves a teaching space, high-contact surfaces, such as desk tops and computer keyboard should be cleaned with water and detergent. Disinfectant should not generally be used, the guidance adds.The monitoring of temperatures to access campuses is not required and gloves should not be worn unless required for other reasons, such as in a research laboratory.Colleges and universities have welcomed the publication of the guidelines and are now working to finalise plans for the next academic year, in collaboration with staff and student representatives.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Energy companies bid against each other for contracts of 16.5 years to provide serviceThe combination of sea-level rise, storm surges and high tides could expose an extra 23 million people to coastal flooding by 2050In throwing out State\u0026rsquos Climate Mitigation Plan, judges have done a real service to Irish democracy"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Inidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping change"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

However, four new cases involved community transmission, meaning the source of the infection was unclear.Some 81 per cent of the new cases were aged under 45 years. There were 31 cases among men and 19 among women.Co Wexford recorded the highest number of new cases, with 11. There were also 10 new cases in Kildare, six in Dublin, five in Donegal and 18 spread across nine other counties (Carlow, Cork, Limerick, Louth, Meath, Offaly, Sligo, Tipperary and Wicklow).“Covid-19 is an extremely contagious virus and we have seen a significant increase in its spread across multiple counties over recent days. We are monitoring this very closely,” Dr Glynn said.“Our focus over the coming weeks will be on continuing every effort to slow the spread of the virus so that our schools can reopen, our healthcare services resume, and our nursing homes are protected.”No increase in eight countiesMeanwhile, only eight counties recorded no increase in Covid-19 cases over the past week, according to HSE figures.There was no change in the number of Covid-19 cases in the week up to last Sunday in counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Longford, Roscommon, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow, data from the HSE’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) shows.The biggest increase in cases were recorded in Cos Dublin and Kildare, each with an additional 46 cases. A further 31 cases occurred in county Laois, and 11 more in Co Limerick.Public health officials have indicated that many of the new cases relate to outbreaks in food processing plants, or among at-risk groups.Over the past week, travel accounted for an additional 14 cases, the HPSC epidemiological reports indicate.Community transmission - where the cause of an infection is not apparent - was involved in an additional 59 cases, with the rate of occurrence of community transmission picking up pace during the week. Overall, the was an increase of 319 cases during the week.Meanwhile in Northern Ireland on Wednesday, it emerged more than 6,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus.

Mass screening has been used in some countries in other infectious disease outbreaks – such as in Australia and some Asian countries during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.However, the evidence review by Hiqa says this type of screening is likely to be ineffective in limiting the spread of Covid-19. “Detection rates are very low due to large proportion of cases that have no symptoms, are infectious before showing any symptoms or who do not present with fever,” the report says.The report says not all cases present with fever, a substantial proportion are asymptomatic and about 25 per cent of symptomatic cases never develop a fever.In addition, some cases may “evade detection” by taking common medicines that reduce body temperature.Using thermal screening could result in a false sense of safety and reduce the number of trained healthcare staff available to work in other areas of pandemic management, the report says.The report finding on the effectiveness of thermal screening relates to point-of-entry only and its applicability to other settings, such as schools, is uncertain, the authors say.ImmunitySeparately, Hiqa has published an evidence summary on potential immunity following infection with Covid-19 or other coronaviruses.Its review of available international research finds that antibodies were detected in nearly all people up to three months after infections, and more than 90 per cent of patients had developed a neutralising antibody response, which protects against further infection. However, a handful of new studies suggest it may be possible to be re-infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.“It remains unclear whether long-term immunity to Sars-CoV-2 is possible,” according to Dr Máirín Ryan, Hiqa’s deputy chief executive and director of health technology assessment.Currently, passengers arriving in Ireland are required to complete a passenger locator form indicating where they will stay for the following 14 days, and to self-isolate at this address for the period.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324043.1596734951!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gps see increase in people with covid 19 symptoms after bank holiday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOn July 31st, the average number of clinical diagnoses per doctor was 0.56, rising to 1.24 on August 4th, after the bank holiday weekend. Photograph: GettyGeneral practitioners have reported an increase in the number of patients who are presenting with Covid-19 symptoms since the August bank holiday weekend, a survey has found.GP Buddy community tracker, a resource for GPs to monitor coronavirus referrals, has been asking doctors to report the number of patients presenting with symptoms of the virus in short daily surveys.The tracker results highlight an increase in the average number of cases per GP of people who were clinically diagnosed with the virus, which means they are believed to have the condition based on their symptoms but it has not yet been confirmed by testing.Overall, there were 298 cases clinically diagnosed by responding doctors on Tuesday, August 4th, up from 114 on July 31st, an increase of 160 per cent.However, the number of respondents on each of the days differed – with 241 respondents to the survey on August 4th and 203 on July 31st – which could have an impact on the results.On July 31st, the average number of clinical diagnoses per doctor was 0.56, rising to 1.24 on August 4th, after the bank holiday weekend.GP Buddy said doctors often saw a “bank holiday Tuesday spike” and they hoped the results from the next few days would be lower.Lockdown effectsDr Maitiú Ó Tuathail, a general practitioner, said his practice had slowly seen a steady rise in the number of people seeking referral for testing since lockdown measures were lifted in July.“I would say in the first two weeks in July, there could be several days that could pass where we wouldn’t refer a single person. What we’ve seen since the last lockdown measures have been reversed is a steady increase in the number of people contacting us,” he said.However, he added this was a good thing, and the public should contact their local GP as soon as they experience any of the symptoms of the virus.“The reality is that it’s very difficult to differentiate from Covid and other viral illnesses without a test. We are seeing people who are contact traced, who have little to no symptoms, but who are positive and people are contacting us with mild symptoms thinking it’s just a cold and they’re coming back positive. So people really need to contact their GP as soon as they develop any of the symptoms.”At a briefing on Thursday morning, the Government warned that the country was in a very “delicate position” in terms of the spread of the virus.Assistant secretary at the Department of the Taoiseach Liz Canavan said community transmission was the biggest risk because the source was difficult to find and clamp down on.On Tuesday, four of the 50 new cases involved community transmission, meaning the source of the infection was unclear.Ms Canavan added that people could stall the latest trend of increasing cases by following the public health advice, washing hands, maintaining social distancing and keeping social interactions to a minimum.

Photograph: Andrew MilliganPA WireLongford-born journalist Peter Geoghegan was sitting in a train carriage in Newcastle just before the Brexit referendum in 2016 when a quest began to unravel a mystery about the Democratic Unionist Party’s role in winning it.Flicking through a “well-thumbed copy” of the  newspaper, Geoghegan, who works now in Glasgow and London, saw the free newspaper’s front page “wraparound” advertisement.In it, British voters were urged to “Take back control”, the slogan of the official Vote Leave campaign,” Geoghegan recalls in his new book, Democracy for Sale, which is published by Head of Zeus on Thursday.“I turned the paper over. An imprint on the back said that the advert had been ‘paid for by the Democratic Unionist Party’,” says Geoghegan, a journalist with opendemocracy.net.“This was very curious. Since its foundation in 1971, the Democratic Unionist Party had never run a single candidate outside Northern Ireland, ” he writes.It was a little epiphany that ultimately led him down a number of other tracks and has resulted in the book.It is filled with the likes Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and a former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence, Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud.Right there, too, is the DUP, which spent £435,000 “on a massive ad campaign promoting Brexit in England. I knew that election spending in the UK is tightly capped.”“I also knew, having worked as a reporter in Belfast, that political donations to Northern Irish parties were kept secret under anachronistic local laws. Perhaps this was a way around campaign limits?”So, would he solve the mystery?Geoghegan contends in Democracy for Sale that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign because Vote Leave had almost used up its permitted spending of £7 million.Vote Leave and the DUP have denied the claim.Uncommunicative groupOther organisations on both sides of the campaign were allowed additional spending of up to £700,000. The author recounts how he discovered that an uncommunicative organisation called the Constitutional Research Council (CRC) donated £435,000 to the DUP to support the Leave crusade.To prop up his Vote Leave-DUP connection conviction, Geoghegan writes, “Two months before the referendum, Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, wrote in an email to senior staff: ‘The DUP also have a £700k spending limit, which can be spent nationwide!’ ”“At that stage the DUP had yet to register as a referendum participant,” Geoghegan writes. “It only did so in late May. When the CRC started giving money to the DUP, Vote Leave had almost completely exhausted its spending allowance.”Geoghegan writes how the DUP’s Brexit “spending spree began on June 9th, exactly two weeks before the vote, when the DUP bought £100,000 worth of placards, bags, window stickers, T-shirts and badges from a small branding agency called Soopa Doopa”.This company was based in the Cambridgeshire cathedral town of Ely. The location and the company was a “surprising choice” for the DUP, thought Geoghegan. The fact that it published more than £800,000 of material for various Leave-supporting groups reinforced his belief that this was part of the alleged Vote Leave-DUP nexus.Two days before polls opened, Geoghegan writes, the CRC donated a further £334,993 to the DUP, much of which was spent on the wraparound ad in the  – a paper that does not circulate in Northern Ireland.He also says the DUP spent £32,000 on digital advertising through a Canadian company called AggregateIQ (AIQ) which had “bought millions of pounds worth of Facebook ads on behalf of a suite of pro-Brexit campaigns clustered around Vote Leave”.The Westminster “fake news” inquiry that began in 2017 and concluded in 2019 heard that AIQ had links with Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm founded by US billionaire Robert Mercer and US president Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, although this has been denied by AIQ co-founder Zack Massingham.Cambridge Analytica got in serious trouble over allegedly misappropriating digital information, including acquiring the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users.Front organisationGeoghegan, following the money trail, writes that “according to Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie, the DUP were simply a front organisation to allow Vote Leave to go beyond spending limits imposed by election laws” – again a charge that Vote Leave and the DUP strongly deny.Geoghegan explores how the only publicly known person associated with the CRC – the group that gave the £435,000 to the DUP – is Scottish businessman Richard Cook, a Conservative Party activist and Glasgow Rangers supporter.He is depicted as a colourful figure, who in 2013 jointly founded a company called Five Star Investments with Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, a former director general of the Saudi intelligence agency who died in 2015. Cook held 5 per cent of the shares, the prince 75 per cent, and a third man, Danish national Peter Haestrup, held the other 20 per cent.Haestrup was allegedly linked to an Indian gun-running case known as the Purulia Arms Drop. Haestrup told Geoghegan he was never charged, had a “100 per cent clean record” and had done nothing wrong. He also explained how the wealth management business did not get off the ground and was dissolved in 2014 after “a lot of good dinners”.Despite these intriguing connections, Geoghegan portrays Cook as a man who would not have £435,000 to easily hand over to the DUP. He is convinced the CRC money came from other sources. Former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy told Geoghegan that Cook, his long-time political adversary in East Renfrewshire, was “a bizarrely unlikely middle-man for this sort of money”.In addition to the £435,000, the author writes about how the CRC made two further contributions to the DUP after the Brexit referendum, totalling more than £13,000 – the DUP very generally and impenetrably saying it had used the money to “further the cause of unionism at home and abroad”.Geoghegan writes that Cook refused to reveal the source of the cash and said that, although he had administered the massive DUP donation, he had never received any money from his involvement in the CRC. “I just run a small consultancy company, doing some waste energy stuff internationally,” he said.Elusive truthGeoghegan does a lot of mining to find the other CRC backers but, as he admits, the gold seam proves elusive, his work not helped by electoral law in Northern Ireland or the DUP’s refusal to answer questions.Under previous electoral legislation in the North, political donors during the Troubles did not have to disclose their names or the size of their contributions because doing so could endanger their lives.In July 2017 that changed when then northern secretary James Brokenshire decided that life had moved on and donation details could be published.It could have been the moment that changed everything. However, it was not to be. Brokenshire could have backdated that legislation to January 2014, but decided not to.This led to allegations that he had done a “side deal” with the DUP – a charge bolstered by the fact that this was at a time when the DUP had signed up to a £1.5 billion confidence and supply deal to keep then UK prime minister Theresa May’s Tory government in power.It prompted former head of the North’s Electoral Commission Seamus Magee to deduce: “The deal on party donations and loans must be part of the DUPConservative deal. No other explanation.”This was denied at the time by DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson.Geoghegan, still chasing, writes how, in mid December 2017, 17 MPs met in a Westminster committee room to consider a legal order that would bring donor transparency to Northern Ireland.During a “truncated and bad-tempered” debate, DUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley, who were observers, insisted that their party had been wholly transparent about the £435,000 donation.Saying that the failure to backdate the legislation “stinks”, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw added: “The only conclusion that any reasonable person can draw is that the DUP was used, with its knowledge, by the CRC to funnel money to the Leave campaign in a way that to this day keeps the source of that money secret. By refusing to make this provision retrospective, the government are effectively complicit in covering that up.”In his book Geoghegan addresses many fascinating issues in relation to “dark money”, Brexit and political funding but in the end admits his investigation into the DUP and CRC does did not answer the big question.The wall of silence could not be penetrated. He concedes, “Just how much control the DUP had over its record donation and how it was spent remains unclear. And who was behind the money is still a mystery.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: iStockFianna Fáil Dublin South West TD John Lahart has urged the government to publish the advice cited by the State’s public health team in a letter to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. At a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the Government decided that pubs that do not serve food, known as ‘wet’ pubs, and nightclubs will remain closed until September at least. It represented a significant tightening of societal restrictions to curb the recent increase of Covid-19 cases in Ireland. In a blow to the licensing industry, the Government decided to delay the already-paused phase four of reopening society for a further three weeks.Besides pubs remaining shut until at least September 1st, the current strict limits of 50 on numbers congregating indoors, and 200 outdoors, will remain in place, a move that disappointed many sporting bodies and wedding venues. The numbers had been due to increase to 100 indoors and 500 outdoors.Prepared twice“Publicans have prepared twice for the safe re-opening of their premises. They have spent thousands on ensuring that their premises meet public health guidelines and that their staff are protected,” Mr Lahart said on Thursday.“Twice they have faced the devastation of being denied the opportunity to open safely – notwithstanding the fact that many of their industry colleagues have successfully managed to do so.”Mr Lahart said he has been informed by his local Garda Superintendent that “the vast majority” of local licensed premises in his constituency are complying with the guidelines with “only two breaches out of well over fifty licensed premises in the constituency.”“Gardaí actively monitor the situation daily, are welcomed by publicans and by patrons who are re-assured by the inspections. It appears that pubs with a food offering have safely managed their re-opening. Publicans, given the devastation they face, are owed the publication of this evidence cited by Nphet to the Minister.“The house party alternative is already emerging, with no regard for any of the HSE and Nphet guidelines. No one wants a second lock-down. Publicans need to be given good reason why they cannot be trusted to open safely. As a consequence of non-compliance, they face the removal of their licence and a file being sent to the DPP.”Asked about the decision to keep pubs closed at the present time, Mr Donnelly said this week that the evidence internationally shows that when countries open up the pubs, Covid cases increase.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Abe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateInfections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4323765.1596715459!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus melbourne enters strict lockdown amid second wave","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA person wearing a face mask walks outside of Flinders Street Station in Melbourne, Australia, August 6th 2020. Photograph: James RossEPAAustralia’s second-biggest city of Melbourne began the first day of a six-week total lockdown on Thursday with the closure of most shops and businesses raising new fears of food shortages, as authorities battle a second wave of coronavirus infections.Shops were boarded shut and streets were deserted in the city of about 5 million people, the capital of Victoria state, which reported 471 new Covid-19 cases and eight deaths in the past 24 hours.More than 18.88 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 707,758 have died, according to a Reuters tally. Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019.Australia has now recorded about 20,000 Covid-19 cases and 255 fatalities, still far fewer than many other developed nations.But the Victorian outbreak threatens to ruin that record and spill into other states such as Queensland where the virus has been all but eliminated.“We’ve flatted that curve once, we’ll flatten that curve again,” Australia’s health minister Greg Hunt told reporters.Victorian premier Daniel Andrews urged Melbourne residents, who have already endured weeks of less severe lockdown, to stay calm and abstain from panic buying amid a surge in demand at supermarkets.“There’s no need for people to be trying to stockpile months and months of food,” Mr Andrews told reporters in Melbourne.Abattoirs are one of the few businesses allowed to stay open in Melbourne, though with a reduced workforce, under the “stage four” lockdown which took effect at midnight on Wednesday.“We have tried to get that balance between reducing the amount of movement, therefore reducing the number of cases, but not compromising what you need being on the supermarket shelves,” Mr Andrews said.Forecast national peak unemployment had been revised upwards to about 10 per cent due to Victoria’s reimposition of restrictions, prime minister Scott Morrison said.Counting those workers on Australia’s wage subsidy scheme, Mr Morrison said effective unemployment would be closer to 14 per cent.“These measures will have a very significant cost, and it will impact the recovery path,” Mr Morrison told reporters in Canberra.Australia had previously forecast unemployment would hit a high of 9.25 per cent this year, as the economy endures its first recession in three decades.After closing its international borders early, locking down cities and launching a campaign of mass virus testing, Australia had reopened in June with daily cases in the single figures.But hidden transmissions among staff employed at quarantine centres led to wider community transmissions in Victoria, which has recorded triple-digit new cases for weeks.Victoria now has the bulk of infections in the country, with more than 13,000 reported cases.Mandatory testsGermany announced mandatory tests for travellers returning from high-risk regions after new coronavirus cases breached the 1,000-a-day threshold for the first time since May, fuelling fears of a return to an economically disruptive lockdown.Health minister Jens Spahn said on Thursday free compulsory testing would be in force from Saturday after the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s public health agency, reported 1,045 new cases in a single day.Part of the increase was due to more tests taking place, he said, but the impact of holidaymakers returning to Germany and of flagging social distancing discipline was also significant.Germany classifies almost all the world outside the European Union as high risk, as well as some regions within the bloc, including Aragon, Catalonia and Navarre in Spain, and Belgium’s Antwerp province.The compulsory tests mean travellers will not have to quarantine for two weeks. Anyone who refuses to take the test could face a fine of up to €25,000.“If anybody thinks they can be stubborn at the airport and deal with the fine when it comes later, no. They’re going into quarantine for two weeks,” Mr Spahn added.Germany’s approach is similar to that in neighbouring France, which requires travellers from some countries to take Covid-19 tests at airports and ports. Some other European countries require travellers to take a test in the days before their trip.With Europe’s largest economy only starting to recover from the near-total lockdown that was imposed in March, any sign of renewed restrictions will dismay investors. Mr Spahn said he thought a renewed closure of shops could probably still be avoided.The head of the German doctors’ union said earlier this week that Germany was already contending with a second wave of the coronavirus and risked squandering its early success by flouting social distancing rules.Jump in casesThe Philippines on Thursday recorded another jump in coronavirus cases to overtake neighbouring Indonesia as the country with the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 infections in East Asia.A recent surge in cases of the virus in and around the capital Manila has pushed authorities to reimpose a lockdown affecting around a quarter of the country’s 107 million people.The Philippines recorded 3,561 new infections on Thursday, taking its total confirmed cases to 119,460. That is higher than Indonesia’s 118,753 infection cases.The death toll rose by 28 to 2,150, which is less than half of Indonesia’s 5,521 fatalities, but is expected to grow after the recent spike in cases.President Rodrigo Duterte announced late on Sunday a two-week lockdown in and around Manila, which accounts for two-thirds of the country’s economic output.The restrictions, which came into effect on Tuesday, were reinstated after a group of doctors and nurses warned that the healthcare system could collapse as a result of a surging number of virus patients.Public transport has been shut and working from home instituted where possible, with only one person per household allowed out for essential goods.The Philippines imposed one the world’s strictest and longest lockdowns in and around the capital, running from mid-March to the end of May, which brought the economy to its knees in the first half. -ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324032.1596734069!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dutch pm under pressure as infection rate doubles","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople in face coverings on a bridge of the Red Light District. Photograph: Remko de WaalANPAFP via GettyDutch premier Mark Rutte has been forced to break off his holiday to deal with a rapid worsening in Covid-19 infections as a result of what appears to be widespread abandonment of obligatory social distancing, particularly among those under 40.Statistics for the past three weeks have shown adherence to the regulations becoming increasingly lax, but the return of Mr Rutte and health minister Hugo de Jonge appears to have been prompted by a doubling in the number of infections in the week to Tuesday.In that week alone, according to the public health institute, 2,588 people tested positive for the virus, almost twice the figure for the previous week.The institute has frequently pointed out where increases in new cases have been matched by increases in the levels of public testing. However, during that week, as long-awaited summer holidays finally got under way, fewer tests were carried out, it said.“The number of infections is increasing sharply, and the fact that it’s not stabilising is giving us cause for concern,” said the institute’s spokeswoman, Susan van den Hof. The surge in cases was “particularly evident” in Amsterdam and Rotterdam and, more recently, The Hague, she said.The city authorities in both Amsterdam and Rotterdam made masks obligatory from Wednesday in busier areas, just a week after the government decided not to make them more widely compulsory nationwide. At the moment, they are mandatory only on public transport.Scathing assessmentPressure on the government has been increased by a scathing assessment of the situation from the umbrella body representing the country’s 25 regional health boards, which are charged with imposing and managing any local lockdowns.“Instead of a reduction, we’re seeing a rise in infections in a wide range of social situations, at home, in cafes and in bars,” it warned as Mr Rutte returned.“People are not keeping to the 1.5m social distancing requirement. Summer means we’re seeing more impromptu gatherings with increasingly close contact. There are also more organised events, such as weddings and funerals, at which the 1.5m rule is not being observed,” it said.In addition, some people were refusing to go into quarantine when it was confirmed they had been in contact with an infected patient – while others were refusing to share the names of people they had been in contact with, the statement said. “If people don’t stick to the rules, our job becomes impossible.”Labour leader Lodewijk Asscher described Mr Rutte as “invisible” and his strategy “impossible to understand”.There’s growing pressure to introduce testing at Schiphol airport for holidaymakers returning from high-risk countries, combined with proper supervision of the 14-day quarantine, and restrictions on universities’ new-intake events.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Anger mounts over missed warnings about consignment of ammonium nitrate at portAmmonium nitrate that exploded on Tuesday arrived on the cargo ship Rhosus six years agoNew details of outbreak in Georgia suggest children may play key role in community transmissionIsraa Seblani was posing for her wedding video when a huge blast ripped through BeirutMore than 5,000 people reported injured as Lebanese officials say toll expected to riseHome of recently married Anthony and Maria Clery among those destroyedDevastating blast will widen political isions and send many more into povertyLebanese drew on experience of countlesss previous disasters in response to explosionUS president Donald Trump casts explosion as possible attack after blast near port kills at least 63Survivors of horrific crimes face a legacy of terror, says Amnesty InternationalOther countries \u0026lsquodefinitely should not do what we have done\u0026rsquo, Israeli government adviser warnsAgreement also reached to join forces with the military in conflict with Houthi rebels\u0026lsquoShield of Israel\u0026rsquo plan devised after government\u0026rsquos response to the second wave widely seen as chaoticGrouping of countries looking east called \u0026lsquoaxis of the sanctioned\u0026rsquoKing Abdullah warns move could destabilise not only the kingdom but the entire regionPrime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel\u0026rsquos annexation plan would destabilise regionRampant inflation and 30 per cent unemployment places huge strain on societyHopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4323963.1596730487!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new york s attorney general sues to dissolve national rifle association","story":"New York attorney general Letitia James has announced a lawsuit against the NRA, alleging senior leaders of the group erted millions of dollars for personal use and to buy the silence and loyalty of former employees. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNational Rifle Association  chief executive Wayne LaPierre speaks during the NRA’s annual convention in Dallas on May 4th, 2018. Photograph: Tamir KalifaNew York Times New York state’s attorney general sued to dissolve the National Rifle Association on Thursday, alleging senior leaders of the pro-gun lobby group erted millions of dollars for personal use and to buy the silence and loyalty of former employees.The lawsuit announced by attorney general Letitia James alleges NRA leaders paid for family trips to the Bahamas, private jets and expensive meals that contributed to a $64 million reduction in the NRA’s balance sheet in three years, turning a surplus into a deficit.Ms James alleged in a statement that NRA leaders “used millions upon millions from NRA reserves for personal use”, failing to comply with the NRA’s own internal policies in addition to state and federal law.The confrontation pits Ms James, a Democrat, against the largest and most powerful gun organisation in the United States, one that is closely aligned with President Donald Trump’s Republican Party. The action is certain to further polarise a country where the NRA is revered by conservatives as a champion of the US constitutional right to keep and bear arms and vilified by liberals as an enabler of rampant gun violence.“The NRA’s influence has been so powerful that the organisation went unchecked for decades while top executives funnelled millions into their own pockets,” Ms James said in a statement. “The NRA is fraught with fraud and abuse, which is why, today, we seek to dissolve the NRA, because no organisation is above the law.”The NRA, which teaches gun safety in addition to advocating laws making it easier for Americans to own guns and ammunition, is subject to New York law because it is registered as a non-profit organisation in New York, where it conducts most of its financial transactions.The association, which has its national headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, about 30km west of Washington, DC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Gun ownersNew York state and the NRA have tangled before. The state has taken legal action against NRA-branded insurance policies sold to gun owners, and the NRA is suing the state for closing gun shops under an executive order to halt the spread of Covid-19.The latest lawsuit names the NRA as a whole and four senior executives of the group including Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice-president who has been atop the leadership for decades.It also names former treasurer and chief financial officer Wilson Phillips, former chief of staff and executive director of general operations Joshua Powell, and corporate secretary and general counsel John Frazer. The suit charges the NRA with “awarding contracts to the financial gain of close associates and family, and appearing to dole out lucrative no-show contracts to former employees in order to buy their silence and continued loyalty,” Ms James’s office said in a statement.“The failure of the NRA to comply with multiple fiduciary responsibilities and state and federal laws resulted in the NRA seeing substantial losses on its balance sheet: going from a surplus of $27,802,714 in 2015 to a net deficit of $36,276,779 in 2018 – contributing to a total loss of more than $64 million in just three years,” the statement said.In addition to attempting to close down a group that has existed since 1871, Ms James seeks to recover millions of dollars in lost assets and to stop the four executives from serving on he board of any other not-for-profit group in the state. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"beiruts explosion years making","story":"Lord knows the Lebanese have suffered. They stumbled out of one of the most brutal civil wars in modern times and into a conflict with Israel. Just as it was recovering from that, neighbouring Syria exploded in protest - sending a wave of refugees its way.Lebanon miraculously buffered the storm, only to be hit by an economic crisis so deep it has plunged most of the country into poverty. Trauma - its citizens often grimly joke - has become part of the national psyche.Yet Tuesday’s explosion was something else. I fear it is more than anyone - even the famously resilient Lebanese - can bear.I spent more than four years in the capital, Beirut, as a Middle East correspondent for The . It’s a complicated and tumultuous place where tempers and passions run high. If you don’t fall in love with it, you’ve misunderstood it. If you don’t hate it, you’ve probably done something wrong.Anyone who has ever left it - which I did in February - knows you leave a piece of your heart behind.Checking in on Wednesday on friends and old neighbours who had become more like family, there was no good news. Most live in and around the historic entertainment district of Gemmayzeh, which is so close to the port that it was effectively a ground zero.One friend took shards of glass to her head and needed stitches, while one was found badly concussed by the site after he had raced down on his motorbike to report on the initial fire.My “Lebanese mother” Christina broke her arm when she was thrown by the blast’s force. Beirut’s health minister urged people to leave the city in case of any residual noxious fumes, but the 52-year-old mother of three - like most others - had nowhere else to go. She swept up the window fragments and put the broken frame back on her broken bed and tried to sleep.Another sobbed down the phone to me as she walked through a hole in her apartment where her front door had been: “Kil shi, kil shi (everything, everything) my whole life is gone.”  There’s little left of the places we used to frequent: Anise bar where we used to drown our sorrows after a tough day reporting the little fruit and veg shop on the corner and the New York Times reporter’s French mandate apartment where I had my farewell party.It is hard to overestimate the damage done to a country half the size of Wales. More than 300,000 people - a fourth of Beirut’s population - have been made homeless overnight. The anaemic state, without serious international help, is incapable of rebuilding. Many in Lebanon had predicted an explosion, though few could have imagined it would come in the form of the 2,750-tonne blast that would devastate half the city.It’s hard to pinpoint exactly where it all went wrong for Lebanon. The country - described in better times variously as the Paris of the Middle East for its glamour and the Switzerland of the region for its exemplary banking sector - had looked to be thriving in recent years.Tourist numbers were up, the beaches along its beautiful Mediterranean coastline were packed. The middle classes appeared more comfortable than they had ever been.For those who had money at least, Beirut was a pleasant enough place to live. But it belied a much more complicated reality.Lebanon had borrowed up to its eyeballs and it was only a matter of time before the bubble burst. Corruption and greed among its ruling class - warlords who had gripped onto power since the end of the civil war in 1990 - had helped bleed the country dry. The politicians didn’t even bother trying to hide it, simply blaming one another.Constant spats between the competing religious sects over who would be awarded the spoils had left them virtually incapable of governing.The problem with Lebanon, as Marwan Muasher, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, put it, is that “corruption has been democratised, it’s not sitting centrally with one man. It’s all over”.Beirutis on Tuesday began cursing their politicians before an official investigation was even underway. Experience had taught them that either incompetence or negligence would be behind the disaster, which has claimed the lives of at least 100 people and injured thousands more.Initial reports suggested that authorities had seized several-thousand tonnes of highly combustible ammonium nitrate and had been storing it at the port. The blast was suspected to have been triggered by a fire started by a welder.Questions will soon be asked as to who signed off on keeping such a large quantity of a volatile and explosive substance stored in a densely populated civilian area. “What exploded today in Beirut is not just ammonium nitrate. It is above all corruption, mismanagement, incompetency and cynical disregard for the security and lives of people,” wrote one local, Dyab Abou Jahjah, who expressed the thoughts of many of his countrymen.Karl Sharro, a well-known Lebanese architect and satirist, tweeted: “Negligence, incompetence, complacency, corruption, nepotism this immoral and parasitical political class has destroyed Beirut and the whole country.”By Wednesday, the phrase hang up the nooses was trending on Twitter in Lebanon.Lebanon had for months been teetering towards ruin.By the time I left Beirut in February there were daily street protests against government corruption. Saad Hariri, the prime minister (the son of a previous premier), stepped down only to be replaced by another equally loathed businessman.Then coronavirus hit. Lebanon had the sense to shut down - fearing that its already beleaguered hospitals would not be able to cope with a major outbreak. But the lockdown sent its poorest - rendered jobless - spiralling into even deeper poverty.At the same time, the country was beginning to feel the full effect of its free-falling economy. The country’s currency lost up to 80 per cent in value in a matter of weeks. Last month it became the first in the Middle East in history to experience hyperinflation.Its once proud and thriving middle class have been forced to sell their possessions in online markets.There was no point looking to the government for help, it had been unable to provide the basics to its people - including water and electricity - even during the “good times”.On Monday, the country’s foreign minister resigned, warning that a lack of vision and a will to implement reforms risked turning Lebanon into a “failed state”. There is little to suggest it can do much now to avoid its wretched fate.Thousands in the Lebanese capital would have had a restless sleep in their dark, hot and windowless homes on Tuesday night. The windows may have been knocked out by the blast, but the darkness was of the country’s own making.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sunny day hiroshima 75 years atomic bomb","story":"It is Monday 16 July 1945, 5.30 am, and a sodden night in the New Mexico desert is suddenly a sunny day.“The whole country was lighted by a searing light with the intensity many times that of the midday sun,” writes General Thomas Farrell, deputy commander of the Manhattan Project, the secret team in Los Alamos dedicated to creating the bomb. “It was golden, purple, violet, gray, and blue. It lighted every peak, crevasse, and ridge of the nearby mountain range with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined.”Just four hours after the ‘Trinity’ test, the first nuclear detonation in history, a ship leaves San Francisco, bound for Tinian Island in the South West Pacific. On board is Little Boy, only the second nuclear bomb ever created.That night the people of Hiroshima feel relatively safe. They have grown so used to American B-29 bombers passing overhead, they have nicknamed them ‘B-San’ or ‘Mr B’. Like the rest of the world, they have never heard of the atom bomb. They do not know that Hiroshima has deliberately been spared conventional bombing so its devastating effects will be clear. Little Boy’s final destination is still not set. The US Targeting Committee has narrowed the possible targets down to three: Hiroshima, Kokura and Nagasaki. The ultimate decision will be chosen based on prevailing weather conditions.6th August. 00.02 For the first time, the crew of the B-29 named Enola Gay is told what weapon they will be carrying. Captain William ‘Deak’ Parsons informs them it will be the most furious explosion since creation, that it might crack the Earth’s crust. In Hiroshima, it is a clear night full of shooting stars.02.45 The Enola Gay takes off. It has been named after pilot Colonel Paul Tibbett’s “courageous red-haired mother”. In Tibbett’s pocket are cyanide capsules, one for each member of his crew, in case of capture. As the aeroplane heaves itself into the air, the crew still do not know where they are heading.04.00 Dr Michihiko Hachiya, a physician at the Hiroshima Communications Hospital, finishes his air raid duty. There is nothing to report.06.41 Captain Parsons begins arming the warhead. He has taken it upon himself to do this en route, dismantling and reassembling Little Boy in the freezing bomb bay. Four heavily-laden B-29s have recently crashed taking off from the Tinian runway, which ends in a cliff. Little Boy weighs 9,700 lbs and required special sunken bays to be dug just to load it into the aircraft. The chance of catastrophe is too great.07.29 “The hour was early the morning still, warm, and beautiful,” Dr Hachiya noted in his diary. “Shimmering leaves, reflecting sunlight from a cloudless sky, made a pleasant contrast with shadows in my garden as I gazed absently through wife-flung doors opening to the south.”High above, the weather plane assigned to check conditions in Hiroshima ahead of the mission passes over the city. An air raid siren greets it, but it’s just Mr B making his rounds. Only now is the target set.08.14 Bombardier Thomas Ferebee on board Enola Gay spots the Aioi Hashi, a T-shaped bridge at the heart of the city. A tone warns the crew of the aircraft to brace themselves. The citizens of Hiroshima hear nothing but a distant thrum. There is no siren. The fireball is hotter than the surface of the sun. Almost everything within one mile of the centre is vaporised instantly. Winds of more than 650 miles per hour turn every shard of wood not immediately incinerated into shrapnel. One quarter of a city of 350,000 are killed instantly. The mountains that surround the city, which gave Hiroshima such pleasant weather, produce a ‘focussing effect’ for the shockwave.The bomb is a grotesque act of creation. It took some of the world’s finest and most creative minds, and $2 billion (more than £18 billion in today’s money), to bring it to life. At the moment of detonation it replaces the historic city of Hiroshima with something new. Hiroshima was known as Mizu no Miyako or the ‘City of Water’. Now it is, according to Dr Hachiya, “no longer a city but a burnt-over prairie”, a City of Fire.Naked survivors, the patterns of their clothes burned into their backs, wander dazed through the inferno, driven by an unbearable thirst. Many die in reservoirs, swimming pools and water tanks, or drown in the swift Ōta river. The outline of the sun through the dust is red. A black rain falls from the sky. Hiroshima is now, in a word repeated over and over again by survivors, “Hell.”It took J Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, 15 minutes to accept the possibility of fission, then a week to sketch Little Boy on his blackboard. He explained: “When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it.”Yet at heart, Little Boy was barely more sophisticated than a medieval cannon, firing a uranium bullet down a tube into a target. The scientists were so confident the contraption would work, they never bothered to test it. The Trinity ‘gadget’ and Fat Man, the bomb later dropped on Nagasaki, were more sophisticated ‘implosion’ devices.The technology developed quickly after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Massive weapons like the thermonuclear Tzar Bomba (thousands of times more powerful than Little Boy) gave way to missile defence shields like Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars, which in turn inspired smarter missiles. The creative spiral was only averted by bans and treaties that are now decaying. There are currently around 14,000 nuclear weapons in the world, down from a high of 70,000 in 1986. How does Little Boy compare to their power? Sharon Squassoni, a global security expert from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, bursts into laughter. It’s not reassuring.“There’s just no comparison, the shift in our nuclear arsenal is astounding. We have a wide range of power and capabilities. We even have bombs where you can dial in the yield before use.”Moreover, the trend towards smaller weapons designed for less indiscriminate destruction doesn’t necessarily make us safer. Seth Baum, executive director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, explains:“In military circles, the overall trend over the years has been away from mass destruction to precision, reducing collateral damage. However, the argument goes that precision actually makes it more likely that we might use them.”New and ever more versatile weapons are now on the horizon, from unpredictable hypersonic delivery systems designed to zig-zag past missile shields, to high-altitude strikes that would disable our electronics and communications networks.For some, the old ways are still the best. The relative simplicity of gun-type devices like Little Boy mean they are perfect for terrorists looking to assemble their own. With the proliferation of nuclear states and lax security in countries of the former Soviet Union, getting fissile material is less a problem than you might think. One Russian prosecutor in a case involving the theft of uranium noted that potatoes were guarded better. There is no reason why a modern-day remake of Little Boy would be any less powerful than the original, says Squassoni. “Of course it would be as powerful as Hiroshima. Little Boy was 15 kilotons – that’s a pretty small bomb.”The hard part has already been done. Creating the bomb was difficult. Recreating it isn’t.In the days afterwards, the explosion is named the ‘pikadon’ by survivors: “flash–bang”. However, those closest to the epicentre insist on calling it simply ‘pika’. They do not remember the boom, only the flare then an eerie silence, a moment of time caught in light like a camera flash.“I remember vividly how a stone lantern in the garden became brilliantly lit,” wrote Dr Hachiya.The atomic bomb uses light as a weapon. It converts matter into energy at the speed of light, and some of its designers had suggested sounding a “super powerful siren” before detonation, to blind anyone who looked up and happened to catch sight of the flash. The survivors were left with an unforgettable image.“That beautiful cloud! Its beauty defies description,” recalled a friend of Dr Hachiya. “I have never seen anything so magnificent in my life!”The doctor noted that “it was at the moment of the birth of this cloud, with its ever-changing colour, that Hiroshima was wiped out. It was at this moment that Hiroshima city, the culmination of many years\u0027 work, disappeared with her good citizens into the beautiful sky.”The ‘mushroom cloud’ became the bomb’s own trademark. It had to be seen to be feared. Some Manhattan Project scientists had wanted to stage demonstrations of the weapon for Japanese generals to convince them to surrender, rather than a live bombing. Hiroshima was selected partly because the damage would be “sufficiently spectacular…when publicity on it is released.” This wasn’t just an act of war, it was a media event. “There stood the Enola Gay, bathed in floodlights like the star of a Hollywood movie,” Colonel Tibbetts recalled about boarding the plane. “For the next 20 minutes we were put through a photo routine to which none of us were accustomed.” As they returned to base, tail gunner Bob Caron snapped a picture of the cloud that sprouted behind them. His would be the only official photographs successfully developed from the mission. He wrote to his mother, asking her to collect press clippings for their scrap book.The view was different from the ground.“Many times I tried to trip the shutter release but the victim would ask for pity,” one Japanese photographer said about touring the aftermath. “It was too cruel, too inhuman to ignore their pleadings.”“If I had known it was an atom bomb, I don’t think I would have ever tried taking pictures.”The strike soon developed into an information war. Initial official reports to the Japanese people were that the US had deployed a new, ‘special bomb’, but the damage was minimal. In Hiroshima, what we would now call ‘fake news’ proliferated among the survivors. Some heard that the city would be uninhabitable for 75 years. There were rumours that Japan had secretly developed its own ‘special’ bombs, and had destroyed Los Angeles among other American cities.American wanted the truth to be known, at least for now. Leaflets were dropped on potential further targets featuring Caron’s snapshot. It noted that “the atomic bomb’s horrendous destructive power can be understood by viewing this photo.” An earlier leaflet dropped on Hiroshima had warned civilians that although the targets were military, “unfortunately, bombs have no eyes.”Seventy-five years later the atomic information war is still raging, but has moved from leaflets to social media. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists warns of a general poisoning of our ‘information ecosphere’, including “sophisticated, technology-propelled propaganda” and leaders throwing doubt on scientists and “national institutions that have historically provided societal stability and cohesion.” The hacking of Twitter in July, in which accounts including American Democratic nominee Joe Biden sent out spam messages, had dark implications. President Trump, apparently not hacked, once tweeted that he had a “much bigger and more powerful” nuclear button than Kim Jong Un.“I don’t think nuclear war could be started by hacking into Twitter,” says Squassoni, “but when you have the leaders of countries issuing nuclear threats on it, that’s a serious development.”Hiroshima’s after-image faded into the culture of the atomic 20th Century, the ultimate symbol of danger and progress. Children could draw the cloud\u0027s silhouette, like Mickey Mouse. It influenced everything from the nuclear-powered rage of Godzilla to the bikini swimsuit, named for nuclear tests on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands.Meanwhile, Hiroshima and its people found themselves transformed into silent symbols. The mushroom cloud. The ruined dome. Kengo Nikawa’s pocket watch, stuck forever at 8.15. And for some, just their shadow, burned into the wall behind them, like a photo negative.9th August 1945. It is a cloudy day in Nagasaki. 40,000 people are blasted into memory. The original target for Fat Man, the second and so far final nuclear bomb used in warfare, was Kokura. It is skipped over due to a thick hanging fog.Meanwhile, Hiroshima is still in the shadow of the first bombing, with many survivors now living in Dr Hachiya’s hospital. A horse, burned and blind, ambles around its garden, eating the leaves of a potato patch the doctor had planted.Eleven days after the blast, more baffling symptoms become evident. People who were relatively unscathed develop speckles on their skin, then die. Another mystery: epilation.“Falling hair! This was an unusual symptom, but undeniable. Unconsciously, I grabbed some of my hair and pulled. I did not have much hair in the first place, but the amount that came out made me feel sick,” wrote Dr Hachiya.No one knows what is happening. They are in the dark.“The idea was to explode the damned thing,” recalled Hymer Friedell, who oversaw biomedical research at the Manhattan Project and later toured Hiroshima. “We weren\u0027t terribly concerned with the radiation”The world experts on the subject were now those who lived through it. Dr Hachiya noted that the closer the survivors were to the centre of the blast, the more likely they were to develop these novel symptoms, placing each patient on a map. The value of this data did not go unnoticed.Navy Secretary James Forrestal told President Truman that survivors would offer “a unique opportunity for the study of the medical and biological effects of radiation which is of utmost importance to the United States.” A legion of international scientists descended on Japan and the survivors. Reports from local doctors were collected and expanded upon. The survivors were to be studied, not necessarily treated. A cure was never an option.Many ‘hibakusha’, as they came to be known, found themselves outcasts. Their stories were censored by the American occupation, while they were shunned by society at large.“Every survivor has had a different experience,” says Takuo Takigawa, director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. “Some people didn’t want to go near them because they were ‘infected’. With others, there was a thought that they would soon die anyway.”Hibakusha were banned from public baths, for fear of contaminating the water. People refused to employ them, and certainly wouldn\u0027t marry one. The spectre of radiation exposure transformed into the idea that they were inherently sullied. Some chose to never have children.“At that time in Japan any physical deformation or injury was heavily shunned,” says Barak Kushner, professor of East Asian history at Cambridge. However, the shame extended even to those without visible injuries. “In some ways they are symbols of Japan’s failure and defeat, and of the poverty to which Japan has sunk, as it’s not able to help them. They don’t get specific compensation until years later.”Meanwhile, studies moved from the immediate aftermath to the long term. By 1950, 130,000 survivors were enrolled in what is known as the ‘Life Span Study’. It precisely surveyed where each survivor was standing relative to the blast, just as Dr Hachiya had done. Surviving hibakusha have reported for check ups right up to today.The study forms the world’s largest bank of knowledge on the effect of radiation on the human body. It is so thorough that in 1982, scientists at the Los Alamos National Lab built a replica of Little Boy – including the uranium – to better understand its findings. It helped develop safe medical uses for radiation, like CAT scans and X-rays. Nasa consulted it to help protect astronauts from cosmic radiation. Now the survey is focussing on the next generation, tracking possible effects on survivors’ children.“The rainy season officially ended yesterday,” Takigawa chuckles. “Today is a very sunny day in Hiroshima.”It is difficult to put a final number on the number killed by the attacks in 1945, given the confusion afterwards and the malignant effects of radiation, but estimates suggest more than 200,000.The rumours that Hiroshima would be uninhabitable for 75 years proved false. Both it and Nagasaki are now thriving. In 1949, a law ordered that Hiroshima be rebuilt as a “Peace Memorial City, a symbol of the ideal of making lasting peace a reality.” Despite fears over radiation, many citizens chose to stay and rebuild the city they loved. Before the war it had a population of around 350,000. Now it’s more than 2 million. The ruin of the industrial museum remains preserved at the centre, the dome cracked and open to the sky.Once forgotten and ignored by the world at large, the hibakusha became figureheads for peace movements worldwide. The Memorial Museum was established at least partly to remind the world that the victims are people, not just symbols.“The hibakusha saw it as a mission of sorts, to tell their story,” says Takigawa. “The reality of what happened, the feelings and memory, must be passed on, so people can feel the horrors of that event themselves.”The threat has not passed, for any of us. Every year since 1947, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, first established by former Manhattan Project workers, set their ‘Doomsday Clock’ to indicate how near we are to annihilation. This year it ticked to 100 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been. They point to the breakdown of arms control treaties a general worsening of relations between the great powers and climate change as contributing factors.“The world is sleepwalking its way through a newly unstable nuclear landscape,” the Bulletin warned. “Any belief that the threat of nuclear war has been vanquished is a mirage.”Moreover, nuclear weapons now have to compete with a wide variety of impending disasters.“They’ve fallen out of the public consciousness, but polling 20 somethings shows they actually believe they will be used in the coming decades. The younger generation is very fatalistic. However, nuclear weapons don\u0027t rise to the top of the agenda for them, whereas climate really does,” says Squassoni.After 75 years, the light from that blast has faded in the public consciousness. Simply put, we are no longer afraid of the atom bomb. Then again, neither were the people of Hiroshima.Few people live in constant fear of the newer threats Seth Baum specialises in, from artificial intelligence to designer viruses that would make coronavirus balk. They’re threats most will never have imagined, right up until the point they happen.“The last time that happened was the September 11 terrorist attack, which was low-tech, but it caught us off guard and changed how we think about the world,” says Baum. “So did coronavirus.”Takigawa says Hiroshima takes pride in teaching the world a lesson about peace, even though it had to suffer terribly for it. “There may be other ways of learning this lesson, but I can’t think of any,” he notes. In 2016, Barack Obama became the first US president to visit the site of the bombing. He gave a touching speech, paying tributes to the hibakusha and noting that “the scientific revolution that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as well.” It’s another admirable lesson, just one of many we’ve learned from Hiroshima and Nagaski: technologically, medically, politically and philosophically.Yet, fundamentally, they’re not lessons the people of Hiroshima needed to learn on 6 August 1945. We can learn from the dead. They can’t learn by dying.

I urge everyone to get a test if you have symptoms, self-isolate and provide your contacts to NHS Test and Trace so we can continue to keep the virus at bay and get back to normal.Researchers carried out initial swab testing of 150,000 people in May, while full lockdown was still in place, and again following the easing of restrictions.Of the 159,199 swab tests carried out in the latest two weeks, just 123 were positive.At any one point in the two weeks between June 19 and July 8, there were 39,000 people with Covid-19, compared to 74,000 in May.The overall reproduction \u0027R\u0027 number was calculated at around 0.58, compared to 0.57 during May.Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College, said: The epidemic has transitioned out of lockdown phase but prevalence has continued to decrease. We estimate a decrease in prevalence from 0.13 per cent to 0.077 per cent. We have to be a little bit careful because the last data were for early July, but we did estimate that the \u0027R\u0027 number was still below one then, so there is a little bit of room at that time for further relaxation of measures within causing the pandemic to return to growth.However, some experts warned that it was too early to say whether later relaxations, such as pubs reopening at the beginning of July, had had a negative impact. Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: This report largely confirms what we already know about the trajectory of the epidemic in England.But it is important to realise that the fact that the early relaxations in June did not cause an increase in cases does not mean that further relaxations will have done so already or will do so in the future.The report, commissioned by the Department of Health, also showed there were no significant differences between the prevalence of infection for key workers and non-key workers, in contrast to the findings from Imperial\u0027s first study.The authors believe improved infection control measures in care homes and hospitals led to fewer workers testing positive. Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups were more likely to test positive than those of white ethnicity, the results showed.The findings also showed that 81 per cent of people testing positive reported no symptoms on the day of the test or the previous week, up from 69 per cent in the previous survey.In separate research released by Public Health England (PHE) and the University of Cambridge experts estimate calculate that the number of infections arising each day across England is likely to be 3,200, and that by the third week of August there will be between 47 and 91 deaths each day.They believe the \u0027R\u0027 number is now likely to be close to one in most regions, with the south-west potentially above one, although the number of infections is very low, making it difficult to be accurate.The probability of \u0027R\u0027 being above one is less than 20 per cent for London and the south-east, and less than five per cent in the east of England.London, followed by the north-west, continues to have the highest attack rate (16 per cent and 10 per cent respectively) – the proportion of the population who have ever been infected. The south-west continues to have the lowest (three per cent).More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh accent among attractive world due bond effect survey","story":"Yesh, it is. The Edinburgh accent has been voted among the most attractive in the world thanks to “The Bond Effect”- courtesy of Sir Sean Connery, a survey has found.Researchers asked 1000 Britons to listen to voice recordings spoken in 20 dialects and rank them on a scale of 1 to 5 based on various positive traits, including attractiveness.Born in Fountainbridge, just west of Edinburgh city centre, Sir Sean, 89, played James Bond in the first five films of the spy series, starting with Dr.No in 1962.His timbre is now recognised across all age groups as one of coolness, helping to cast the Scottish capital\u0027s dialect in a similarly smooth light internationally, according to researchers.Commenting on the findings, Rachael Lloyd, a relationship expert at eharmony, told The Daily : “No doubt, people mentally heard the phrase “Bond, James Bond” in Sean Connery\u0027s famous burr as they responded.“A major reason for this popularity is that he is someone who is familiar to all age groups, who know him as the suave, sophisticated \u0027original\u0027 Bond and as such, link the accent to these qualities. The fact that these universal associations stand the test of time have a really significant impact on how people perceive others with the same accent.”In the study, participants listened to the same 40 voice recordings read by actors in different accents, before ranking the clips for traits such as charm, good humour and intelligence.The sentence read: “In Britain we can expect rain at any time of the year. While winter is wetter than summer, seasonal differences in rainfall are very small.”Received pronunciation was seen as the most attractive accent with an average score of 3.34, due to its association with intelligence, followed by the New Zealand accent on 3.06, and Edinburgh was third at 2.91.In contrast, the Cornish dialect ranked last for attractiveness, with a score of 2.28, although it was rated highly in relation to a good sense of humour.But the distinctive Celtic twang only marginally lost out to Spanish and French, which came 18th and 19th respectively.Researchers said views on accents are largely shaped by perceptions of celebrities speaking with them on TV and in films.The study noted that just under a quarter of people surveyed felt more positively about the Geordie dialect because of Ant and Dec\u0027s likeable on-screen personalities.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"large ammonium nitrate stores australia cause localresidents","story":"Residents in and around  Newcastle, Australia, have expressed fears about the town’s vast stockpile of ammonium nitrate – which could be almost four times bigger than the amount that exploded in Beirut.Between 6,000 and 12,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate is stored at Orica\u0027s Kooragang plant in the New South Wales town. Lebanon\u0027s Interior Minister said 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded in the Beirut blast.The plant is within 800 metres of residents in North Stockton and just three kilometres from Newcastle’s central business district.Chemical engineer and community campaigner Keith Craig told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that “many people would be killed and injured if we had an accident at Orica”.“It\u0027s a totally inappropriate place to have such a dangerous material produced and stored, and it\u0027s something we\u0027ve been complaining about for many, many years,” he said.Orica told the ABC that safe storage of the chemical is strictly regulated and audited.Explosives expert Tony Richards told the Sydney Morning Herald that there was enough ammonium nitrate stored at the plant to obliterate Newcastle.The below graphic shows the radius of the blast in Beirut.While the ammonium nitrate in Lebanon is believed to have been left in an unsecured warehouse, a New South Wales Environmental Protection Authorities spokesperson told the Sydney Morning Herald that Australian storage facilities are subject to strict conditions and regular inspections to ensure compliance.However, residents have noted that inconsistent standards saw one ammonium nitrate facility moved away from homes in South Australia over safety concerns, while in New South Wales a similar facility is within 500 metres of a nursing home.*  Read more: Ammonium nitrate: what is it and why did it cause the blast in Beirut?More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/20/16/solar-energy-.jpg","title":"brightest material ever fluorescent light","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Applications include realistic 3D displays and harvesting invisible light for solar powerA major breakthrough with fluorescents has allowed scientists to create the “brightest known materials in existence”.The advance paves the way for a new class of materials that transform fluorescent dyes into solid objects, according to researchers from Indiana University in the US and the University of Copenhagen.There are more than 100,000 fluorescent dyes in existence but until now it was not possible to mix them in a predictable way in order to produce solid optical materials.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers formulated the new class of materials, called small-molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES), using positively charged fluorescent dyes to create a solid material.Applications for the material range from solar energy harvesting to next-generation OLED displays.Solar energy breakthrough creates electricity from invisible light“These materials have potential applications in any technology that needs bright fluorescence or calls for designing optical properties, including solar energy harvesting, bioimaging, and lasers,” said Amar Flood, a chemist at Indiana University and co-author of the study.“Beyond these, there are interesting applications that include upconverting light to capture more of the solar spectrum in solar cells, light-switchable materials used for information storage and photochromic glass, and circularly polarised luminescence that may be used in 3D display technology.”Fluorescents have the unique property of absorbing light of a certain colour and emitting a light of a different colour and wavelength. For example, fluorescent materials are able to absorb ultraviolet (UV) light – which is invisible to humans – and emit light on the visible spectrum, making it appear as though the material is glowing.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Like young children sitting at story time, they interfere with each other and stop behaving as iniduals.To overcome this, Professor Flood and his team mixed the dye with a colourless solution to prevent the fluorescent molecules from interacting.

Simon Smith, who leads a primary school in Yorkshire, said test and trace was a “key element” in keeping schools safe. “Parents need to feel all the systems are there,” he told The Independent, ”and that if something does happen, things will happen very, very quickly in terms of the actions that schools will take”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Track and trace is a key part of that,” the headteacher at East Whitby Primary Academy said.His comments come after a study has suggested the government must scale-up its test and trace system - which tells people if they have been contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus and to isolate for two weeks – to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections as schools fully reopen.

Speaking about test and trace, Mr Smith from East Whitby Primary Academy said: “As a headteacher, I feel very little confidence at the moment around the fact we would be informed, or everybody is being informed that should be informed.“It may be people are wandering around with the virus without knowing.”Pepe Di’Iasio, a headteacher near Rotherham, said a scaled-up test and trace system would help his school feel better prepared for the September return. “I think we would all feel better if we had confidence in the system and obviously with four weeks to go,” Mr Di’Iasio, who is also vice president elect of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), told The Independent. “We would rather have that confidence as quickly as possible.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers from University College London and LSHTM simulated various scenarios to examine the possible implications of schools reopening in the UK coupled with broader reopening of society, such as more parents returning to the workplace and increased socialising within the community.The authors of the modelling study – published in The Lancet Child And Adolescent Health - found that “with increased levels of testing... and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.“Reopening schools fully in September, alongside reopening workplaces in society, without an effective test, trace, isolating (TTI) strategy could result in a second wave of infections between two and 2.3 times the size of the original wave,” Mr Bonell from LSHTM said.“Currently, TTI is not achieving the levels that we modelled. Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it’s about 50 per cent coverage,” he added.The NAHT, a school leaders’ union, said the new research showed “just how many factors there are to preventing a worsening Covid-19 outbreak, most of which are entirely outside a school’s control”.Efficient test-trace-isolate system needed to reopen schools- studyMinisters still planning to open all English schools in SeptemberMPs criticise school meal voucher scheme for covering M\u0026ampS but not LidlPaul Whiteman, the general secretary, said: “The success of September’s return to school rests as much on what happens outside the school gates as within.”He added: “The government needs to ensure that everyone knows what actions they should be taking to keep everyone safe – we’re all going to need to work together to be successful.”Meanwhile, Richard Bettsworth from ASCL said: “It is very clear that an effective test, trace, and isolate strategy is vital in suppressing the rate of infection, and keeping schools open.” The director of public affairs added: “The government has to make sure that this works at the scale that is necessary.”Schools are expected to fully reopen to all students in September.  A government spokesperson said: “We have rapidly built, from scratch, the largest diagnostic testing industry in British history. Over 16 million tests have been delivered so far and we have the capacity to carry out more than 330,000 tests per day, growing to 500,000 per day by the end of October.“Plans have been put in place to ensure schools can re-open safely. Local health officials, using the latest data, will able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases.They added: “The NHS Test and Trace service has now and contacted more than 218,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, or recently been in contact with someone who has tested positive – in order to break the chain of transmission.”Additional reporting by Press Associationtest and trace\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

All together the intention there is just to keep you playing instead of doing other things that may not be necessary in the game.”Fifa 21 is going to other lengths to reduce wasted time while playing multiplayer games, including the removed of the “walk back” animation that sees players return to the centre circle, and the time given to take set pieces has been scaled back from 30 seconds to 10, 12, 15 and 20, for kick-offs, throw-ins, goal kicks and free kicks, respectively.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The latest data shows thousands of people are still not being reached by the test and trace service and the head of Serco Rupert Soames, who employs 10,500 contact tracers, has admitted up to a fifth of contacts may be untraceable.The latest weekly data shows that overall, 4,642 people were transferred to the contract tracing system in the last week, with 79 per cent reached by contact tracers.Of those spoken to, 19,150 people were identified as coming into close contact with someone who has tested positive.Of these, 72 per cent were reached and asked to self-isolate, a drop from 76 per cent in the previous week.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only 56 per cent of close contacts handled online or by call centres were reached and told to self-isolate for 10 days.In comparison, local health protection teams have been more successful, reaching 98 per cent of close contacts of people who tested positive.In recent weeks local health officials have criticised the national centralised service for failing to reach enough close contacts, including in areas hit the worst by the virus such as parts of the north west of England.There is now a push to recruit more people to local health protection teams and local councils have been given increased access to patient level data in order to carry out their own local test and trace service.More than three quarters of people who were tested at a regional testing site for Covid-19 received their result within 24 hours, but overall 97 per cent of results were communicated the next day if not within 24 hours.Since the launch of test and trace, 199,524 close contacts of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 have been reached through the tracing system and asked to self-isolate.This is 82.2 per cent of a total of 242,749 people identified as close contacts.Scientists on the government\u0027s SAGE committee have said the service must reach 80 per cent in order to be useful in curtailing the spread of the virus.The remaining 43,225 people were identified as close contacts, but were not reached.Executive chair of NHS Test and Trace Baroness Dido Harding said: Test and Trace is working. It has already helped to prevent almost a quarter of a million people unknowingly spreading the virus. But we do not work alone. Close partnerships with local government and local public health teams are essential to stop the spread of the virus, and NHS Test and Trace continues to work hand-in-hand to support communities experiencing spikes in cases, through increased testing and additional contact tracing.“Winter may seem far away but it’s what we do right now that counts. So please do play your part to stop the virus from flaring up again – this system will only work if you come forward for a test and help us to trace your contacts. So if you have symptoms, however mild, get a free test immediately. If you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace, follow the advice you receive. This is how, together, we’ll get back to the things we love.”test and trace\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The extra size is explained in large part by the lower gravity found on those worlds.Despite their vast size, the tubes are still thought to be stable enough to serve as a home. The lower gravity also means that the forces that might collapse the tubes on Earth would not pull them down on the Moon or Mars, scientists said.SpaceX launches and lands Mars-bound Starship craftAs part of the research, scientists from the European Space Agency as well as the universities of Bologna and Padua explored examples of such caves on Earth, where they can be found in Hawaii, the Canary Islands, Australia and Iceland.They also measured the size of collapsed tubes on the Moon and Mars, using images and other data taken from visiting probes. They then compared that data with information about collapsed chains on the Earth\u0027s surface, allowing them to understand the relationship between those tubes that collapse and others that stay stable.They found that the conditions on other worlds would allow them to grow much bigger before they fall in.Tubes as wide as these can be longer than 40 kilometres, making the Moon an extraordinary target for subsurface exploration and potential settlement in the wide protected and stable environments of lava tubes, said Riccardo Pozzobon, one of the researchers on the paper, and a scientist at the University of Padua. The latter are so big they can contain Padua\u0027s entire city centre.Such tubes on other worlds could form a key part of plans to go and stay on the Moon and Mars, where conditions would be much more dangerous than they are on Earth.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

TikTok founder says Trump is trying to kill off viral video app “The hub will also collaborate closely with regional regulators, policymakers, government and law enforcement agencies where required in the continued pursuit of promoting the highest possible standard of user safety,” it continues.TikTok was reportedly approved by the UK government to launch its headquarters in London, but has not confirmed it, only saying that the company is considering the possibility of headquarters outside of the United States.TikTok’s moderation policies have also been called into question in the past a report in 2019 based on leaked documents about how TikTok deals with content on its platform, stated that the viral video app censored content that mentioned Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong.Instagram launches its own version of TikTokThe TikTok debacle shows the wrong approach is being taken with ChinaA TikTok ban would be a great loss to pop cultureImprobably, what happens to TikTok matters to the world economyAt the time, TikTok said the documents were based on heavy-handed rules the company enforced while it was starting up and are now not being used. Since then, TiKTok has released comparatively more information than other social media companies about how its algorithm works with regards to content moderation and content recommendation.The company has apparently been thinking about developing a European data centre for some time. “It\u0027s a significant investment,” TikTok’s director of public policy for Europe Theo Bertram, told the BBC.”It\u0027s a symbol of our long-term commitment to Europe, and I think that\u0027s an important message for our users and our creators at this time.““There are lots of reasons to come to Dublin, our prime reason being access to a great talent pool,” he told the , but also shed no light on the future location of its global headquarters.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Saturday will likely be another hot day for southern and central parts of the UK, with heatwave conditions possibly being met in parts of southeast England and East Anglia,” he added.31 July was the hottest day of the year so far, with the highest temperature recorded at 37.8C in Heathrow. The Coastguard reported its busiest day for more than four years as it dealt with over 300 incidents and has warned people planning to visit a beach or the coast to “follow beach safety advice”.How to sleep during a heatwave, according to expertsGareth Morrison, RNLI head of water safety, said: “Our coastline is a fantastic place to spend time together as a family, especially when the sun is out and it’s hot.“But there are also plenty of potential dangers, especially for those who aren’t fully aware of their surroundings and may be visiting a particular beach for the first time.”The very hot conditions are expected to last in the southeast of England until at least Monday, possibly even Tuesday, with temperatures hovering between low to mid-30C from Saturday onwards, said the Met Office.Councils across the country jointly issued a plea for members of the public to maintain social distancing and keep an eye on vulnerable or elderly family and friends during the heatwave.The Local Government Association (LGA) said in a statement: “The ‘rush to the sun’ following easing of lockdown restrictions in recent weeks has become a serious challenge for councils responsible for beach safety.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The explosion that killed at least 145 and left hundreds of thousands homeless could not have happened without a huge stockpile of ammonium nitrate. It could not have happened without that explosive material being confiscated from, or possibly abandoned by the Rhosus, a Russian-owned cargo ship. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd it could not have happened without the negligence of Lebanese authorities in allowing the dangerous cargo to sit in deteriorating conditions in the docks for six years.The figure of Igor Grechushkin features prominently in the first two links of that hapless chain. A rough-and-tumble businessman from Khabarovsk in the Far East of Russia, Mr Grechushkin was on Thursday confirmed as the Rhosus’s owner by Russian state media.He had made contact with the Russian consulate in Nicosia, diplomatic sources said. Greek media have reported he is being sought by Cypriot police for questioning. Beirut in mourning as families desperately search for loved ones A seized ship and the Russian connection to Beirut blastLebanon declares state of emergency over Beirut explosion – updatesMr Grechushkin controlled the Rhosus from a company registered in the Marshall Islands. But he conducted his business from Cyprus, a traditional, low-tax base for all kinds of Russian business. We already know much about the Rhosus’s fateful last journey. Contracted to transport 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate from Batumi in Georgia to an explosive factory in Mozambique, the ship was abandoned after failing a safety inspection on a stop in Beirut in December 2013. The vessel, and part of the crew, were held in port as authorities worked out what to do. The crew was only released 11 months later, in September 2014 — the same time the dangerous cargo was unloaded to a warehouse in the docks. In interviews with Russian media on Tuesday night, Boris Prokoshev, the captain of the vessel, described how Mr Grechushkin stopped paying the bills and left the Russian-Ukrainian crew to their fate. “If we weren’t brought food by a certain Beiruti guy, we would have died,” he told the Mediazona publication. Neither Mr Grechushkin nor the intended owners took any subsequent interest in the ship’s dangerous cargo, Capt Prokoshev added. He wrote to President Putin to express his concern, but was ignored by the Kremlin too.  No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But he later realised his boss may not have enjoyed the soundest financial footing. Problems with cash were evident on a stopover in Greece, when the owner ordered necessary supplies for the ship, and then refused to pay for them. There were also problems with crews walking out. It would only be later that the captain realised they had not been paid for four months. Now is the time for action – not just kind words – to help BeirutCapt Prokoshev says he gave up on an attempt to sue the absent owner for lost income after a Russian court advised him to pursue the claim in Cyprus.  By the time the crew were freed by a Lebanese court in September 2014, Capt Prokoshev said Mr Grechushkin owed him $60,000 in unpaid wages, his senior mechanic $50,000, third mechanic $20,000 and navigator $10,000. Mikhail Voytenko, the editor of Maritime Bulletin, who presciently referred to the Rhosus’s cargo as “a floating bomb” six years ago, suggested no aspect of the story was particularly unusual. Ammonium nitrate was a common enough cargo, he told The Independent, used the world over for fertilisers and mining explosives, and this was likely what it was destined for in Mozambique. “Chancer businessmen” at the start of shipping careers often took on “risky jobs” without proper finance to back them up, he suggested. Meanwhile, port authorities around the world were guilty of negligence, corruption or both. It was the confluence of all three factors together, Mr Voytenko said, that made the events of Tuesday possible. Of the three factors, the most important was the negligence and corruption of Lebanese authorities, he added. In the search for fall guys, the media had arguably focussed too much on Mr Grechushkin, who had been deprived of his assets and had “no obvious legal or factual obligation”.“Whatever in the world made the port authorities keep the cargo for six years is beyond my comprehension,” he said. “It seems likely that authorities couldn’t decide among themselves just how to split up the profits.” Mr Voytenko suggested the sell-on value of the ammonium nitrate to be worth upwards of $1m.According to Capt Prokoshev, that figure corresponds to the amount Mr Grechushkin took for payment for the shipment in Batumi. “He simply decided to dump the ship and pocket the million,” the captain said in an interview with Radio Svoboda, without offering paper evidence of his claims. The Independent was unable to reach Mr Grechushkin to confirm this or other aspects of the story. Capt Prokoshev meanwhile said he was too ill, with high blood pressure, to offer any additional comment.

Indoor performances will not resume. Pilots of larger crowds in sports venues and conference centres will not take place.“We have to act rapidly in order to protect the ones we love. He also said that the national pause on shielding will proceed on August  as planned for most of the country.Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, added that we have probably reached the limits of what we can do in terms of opening up society. During his July  announcement, Boris said that the lockdown is to be stalled, but there are still plans for later this year.Future plans are all subject to change should coronavirus infections pick up again.The government will review the situation and could go ahead with plans to reopen businesses that were originally meant to open August .The following towns in Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire have all been hit with a local lockdown:Those living in these areas are banned from meeting people they do not live with inside their home whether they live inside the affected areas or not.This is unless someone living alone from another household is in your support bubble.You must not socialise with people you do not live with .You can still meet people you do not live with outdoors in groups of no more than six.

Portugal, in September  — two years before Madeleine vanished from the Ocean Club complex in the same Algarve resort.A female FBI agent interviewed the widow about the attack on behalf of Portuguese police.Christian B, who we are not naming for legal reasons, is the prime suspect in Madeleine’s disappearance and was born in Germany in  but moved to Portugal in his late teens.The -year-old paedo #

same position as we’d left her.“For Gerry, this became one of those images I described earlier, pictures that fix themselves indelibly, almost photographically, in the memory.“He paused for a couple of seconds to look at Madeleine and thought to himself, she’s so beautul.“After pulling the bedroom door to, restoring it to its original angle, he went to the bathroom before leaving the

appealing against a conviction for the  rape of a -year-old woman, also at Praia da Luz.The paedo is a suspect in a string of unsolved crimes, reportedly including an alleged attack on a -year-old British girl in the resort in , one of a series of incidents where young girls were targeted.German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the investigation into him, previously told the PA news agency that prosecutors have “concrete evidence”, but not “forensic evidence” that Madeleine was killed by the suspect.He said they may “know more” than Scotland Yard, who are still treating the case as a missing person investigation.There has also been search activity in Portugal.Earlier this month police and ers in the Algarve examined three disused wells around  miles from Praia da Luz.The new suspect in the Madeleine McCann case once lived in a squalid villa in Portugal – just a few miles from where the youngster went missing in The Algarve.Pics of the “disgusting and vile” farmhouse-style property show rubbish scattered outside and a badly overgrown garden.Neighbours in Portugal described its former resident as an “angry” man who vanished suddenly after leaving a bizarre collection of wigs and exotic clothing.One told Sky News: “He arrived in the mid-nineties and rented the place from the English owner.“He went back to Germany at one stage and moved another German guy in to look after it, then came back and threw him out on the street.“He was always a bit angry, driving fast up and down the lane, and then one day, around , he just disappeared without a word.#The woman then added: “About six months later I was asked to help clean up the place and it was disgusting, absolutely vile.“It had been trashed, with broken stuff like computers all over the

about her former neighbour.Madeleine McCanns disappearance from the holiday resort of Praia da Luz  years ago sparked one of the biggest missing person hunts in modern history.Praia da Luz, known simply as Luz, is a parish located around four miles from Lagos in the Algarve, Portugal.The community had a population of just , when a census was last carried out in .Once a small fishing village, its been dubbed #little Britain# for the concentration of Brits who take holidays there.Julia Meyer, a spokeswoman for the prosecutors office in Braunschweig, told The Sun today that there is still #no comment# in regards to last weeks dig of an allotment in Hanover.She added: #We currently have no plans to issue a statement about the search.#We are currently not commenting on the ongoing investigation.#Kate McCann made a “horror” discovery while combing through police files on her daughter’s discovery.The heartbroken mum revealed in her book how the family’s routine with friends they were holidaying with could have been easily monitored by anyone watching them.A friend of the family had made a block booking at a tapas restaurant close to their apartment so they could check on their young children intermittently.She wrote: “It wasn’t until a year later, when I was combing through the Portuguese police files that I discovered that the note requesting our block booking was written in a staff message book, which sat on a desk at the pool reception for most of the day.“This book was by definition accessible to all staff and, albeit unintentionally, probably to guests and visitors, too.“To my horror, I saw that, no doubt in all innocence and simply to explain why she was bending the rules a bit, the receptionist had added the reason for our request.“[It was because] we wanted to eat close to our apartment as we were leaving our young children alone there and checking on them intermittently.”Madeleine McCann was three when she disappeared while on holiday with her family in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May  .German investigators have alleged that Christian B, , killed her soon after abducting her from a holiday apartment in the resort.That’s despite British

that Madeleine was killed by the suspect.He said they may “know more” than Scotland Yard, who are still treating the case as a missing person investigation.In her book Madeleine: Our Daughters Disappearance and the Continuing Search for Her, Kate McCann details how their ground-floor apartment was a “prime” spot for criminals.She wrote: “Though I envied David and Fiona with their sea view, being on the ground floor meant we didn’t have to worry about the children’s safety on a balcony.”Kate continues: “Later, we were told by the British police that the ground-floor location, access to roads front and side, secluded entrance and partial tree cover made our apartment a prime target for burglars and criminals.“Never once did this occur to us when we arrived.”Christian B kept kids’ clothes and swimwear in his mobile home, it has emerged.Convicted paedophile Christian B, , bought the red and white Allegro Bay RV in early  — three years after moving back to his native Germany from Portugal.Pals said he used it to drive regularly back and forth between Germany, Spain and Portugal and once boasted how he could allegedly “carry children and drugs” inside.Cops found the clothes and swimwear after seizing the RV as part of their probe into missing Inga Gehricke, who disappeared in  during a picnic with her parents.Christian B used a derelict crate factory at Neuwegers­leben as a weekend pad where he kept the RV.The items were found there in  along with USB sticks containing images of child sex abuse.Other images on the sticks included some of Christian B partially naked or wearing stockings performing a solo sex act.The six data sticks and two memory cards were found buried under the body of his dog at the factory, wrapped in a carrier bag.The prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann has been cleared of involvement in the rape and murder of another young girl.Christian B had been a suspect in the  killing of Claudia Ruf, , whose partly burned body was found  miles from the German town of Grevenbroich.She had been kidnapped while walking a neighbours dog.In an update this week, however, it was confirmed that he couldnt have been Claudias killer.#After comparing the information obtained, it can be said that Christian B was not in Grevenbroich at the time of the crime in the case of Claudia Ruf,# a police spokesman told Bild.#In addition, a DNA comparison is said to have been negative.#Last year, police in Grevenbroich started DNA tests on hundreds of men as they hoped for a breakthrough in the unsolved murder investigation.It will probably take until the end of  to complete the DNA screening with approximately  samples, Bild reports.Kate McCann still buys birthday and Christmas presents for missing Madeleine in the hope she will one day come home to open them.She has told how she carefully chooses gts every year that are the right age for her daughter # who would have turned  in May.Madeleine was nine days short of her fourth birthday when she was abducted on a family holiday in Portugal on May , .Kate, husband Gerry and their twins Sean and Amelie hold a birthday tea party every May  and put presents in Madeleines unchanged pink bedroom.On the tenth anniversary of Maddies disappearance, ex-GP Kate said: “I do all the present buying.#I think about what age she is and buy something that, whenever we find her, will still be appropriate so there’s a lot of thought goes into it.”She referred to the birthday of her eldest child as a #dficult time because that’s when you really feel

Junior idols are singers and models who are marketed as stars from a very young age in Japan, which can even include pre-teen children. Although some see it as a way of building an audience before adulthood, the junior idol subculture has been criticised for sexualising young girls for an audience overwhelmingly made up of middle-aged men. And in a country where possession of child sex abuse images wasnt made illegal until , many think the practice is dangerous. Now a new Marcel Theroux documentary, Unreported World: Schoolgirl Pin-Ups, delves into the creepy culture by following one junior idols quest for stardom. I think it’s dangerous, one junior idols tells Theroux when askedother fans in the culture are sexually attracted to children.Of course, not everyone has this feeling. But when I talk to them, many are dangerous.”The Channel  documentary covers the le of Yune – who was scouted into the seedy junior idol business when she was just six years old. Now , shes constantly working to grow her audience in Japan, which boasts the second biggest music industry on Earth. “I’ve always dreamed of standing on stage at the Budokan, Yune tells Theroux, referring to the ,-seater Tokyo stadium thats hosted the likes of The Beatles and Taylor Swt. To help her realise Yunes pop star dream, her mum takes her to junior idol gigs and helps her with her weekly broadcasts on a live streaming app called Showroom. “I think for Yune, people come for her singing voice,” Yunes mum tells Theroux. But she also recognises theres a darker side to the junior idol business, keeping her address a secret and carefully moderating all the comments on Yunes livestreams before her daughter sees them.In one broadcast, which is watched by over  fans, Yune sings: Give me, give me your love, kiss me baby, won’t you pamper me sometimes At the end of the broadcast, in which adult fans can send her cash presents, one -year-old man tells her shes very beautul.Despite the questionable comments, Yunes mum isnt worried. We have to think of a balance, she tells Theroux. One doesn’t have to see what one doesn’t have to see.But when you’re trying to achieve something, there will always be obstacles.” Even seedier than the livestreams are the live shows, in which  menflock into a concert hall to see a showcase of the girls in the flesh. After the £ performance, fans can then queue up to meet the children afterwards, paying another £ for a CD or signed Polaroid.But many fans just want to have their photo taken with the junior idols themselves – one even asks Yune to handcuff herself to him in a picture. This kind of culture is kind of a little bit growing and blooming in Japan, but still, most of the Japanese think it’s not a good culture, one fan tells Theroux. We enjoy her performance in a gentleman’s way, so no pressure, no harassment, but we support her play and her growing up.” The -year-old who told Yune she was beautul on the livestream even pays extra to do his own private photo shoots of her after shows. The superfan, called Koji, slavishly attends Yunes gigs, even travelling to Taiwan and the Philippines to watch her. “I do find it really weird, Theroux says. There’s something strange about seeing these middle-aged men who are basically starstruck by these -year-old girls.” Even Yunes own manager understands what hes exposing the little girl to. I can’t judgethe audience is watching in a sexual way, Mr Karimata tells Theroux.All I can do is protect hersomeone in the room tries to touch her.”The disturbing sexual element of her followers is also something the men who follow her recognise. Normal people think we are creepy, Koji says. Wherever I go, people think the same way.”But when pressedjunior idols fans are sexually attracted to children, Koji confirms the grim reality. “To be honest there were fans of Yune like that. I think it’s dangerous, he says. Of course, not everyone has this feeling. But when I talk to them, many are dangerous.”Some people who have studied the junior idol phenomenon think part of the obsession stems from Japans epidemic of loneliness. Over million adults under the age of  in the country - which has a population of .million - arent in a relationship, leading to a whole service industry catering to satisfying the needs of lonely men.One notorious example are the maid cafes, in which blokes pay to be served drinks by young girls dressed as french maids. “For people who come [to maid cafes] their actual le and families seem , like a fake world, says Prof Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who has studied loneliness in Japan. When they come here, they feel more like themselves.Prof Yamada estimates that a quarter of all Japanese people under  wont ever get married, and they turn to alternative virtual love to fill the gap. People are looking for a fantasy family, such as a sister, mother or lover, he says. In the case of idols, it’s a daughter. Satisfying people who want a fantasy family has become a business.”But despite loneliness being a factor in the spread of the junior idol subculture, Theroux remains wary of its risks. “If I’m right, the junior idol industry is playing with fire, gratying desires that would be criminalacted upon, he says. As Yune treads her dficult path towards stardom, I just hope that those around her will continue to keep her safe.Unreported World: Schoolgirl Pin-Ups is on Channel  on Friday, th August, at .pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Clemmie Hambro was Princess Dianas youngest bridesmaid at her wedding with Prince Charles in July . Flight logs seen by the Mail show that she flew on Epsteins jet after visiting his ranch in New Mexico and his Little St James island, known to locals as Paedo island. Epsteins island of Little St James lies between St Thomas and St John, two of the largest islands of the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean.The -acre island was bought by the financier in  for an estimated .million and was owned by him until his death in .Miss Hambros first flight, from Epstein’s “New Zorro” ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico to Teterboro airport in New York, was taken on February ,  with two other women as well as Epstein himself. She said the New Mexico trip was a “work trip” to help the financier decide which art to buy for the ranch. The second trip, meanwhile, took place on March  when she flew from St Thomas - used by Epstein to reach Little St James island- to Teterboro airport.She said this trip was a “personal invitation, adding that she “didn’t know anyone there and “didn’t really enjoy myself”. According to the records, Epstein was present on both flights. Epsteins longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is awaiting trial for allegedly aiding Epsteins abuse, was also present for one of the trips.The now married mum-of-four was a -year old employee at Christies auction house in New York when she made the trips in .Miss Hambros contact details were also listed in Epsteins infamous Little Black Book, according to the Mail.A statement from Miss Hambro read: The first flight was a work trip with female colleagues to look at Epstein’s new home in Santa Fe to discuss what art he was going to buy.The second trip, to Little St James, was a personal invitation, which I thought would be fun to accept, but I didn’t know anyone there, didn’t really enjoy myself, and never went back. My heart breaks for all the survivors, now I know what happened on that island.In the course of those two trips, I was not abused, nor did I see anyone abused, or anything untoward happen, with minors or otherwise. I have been completely horried about the revelations of his conduct since then. I was clearly very lucky, my heart goes out to those who were abused by him, and I trust they get the justice they so deserve.She added: I was young and naive, and could not conceive of what was to unfold.There is no suggestion she was involved in any wrongdoing.Epstein bought the island of Little St James more than two decades ago, transforming it into a high-security private oasis.Court papers allege that prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well known prime minister and other world leaders have visited the island before.It is alleged that the American lawyer and academic Alan Dershowitz was seen on the island - a claim he has repeatedly denied.Epsteins alleged madame, Ghislaine Maxwell, is also said to visited the island a number of times.Bombshell legal papers also claim that former president Bill Clinton once flew to Jeffrey Epsteins orgy island with two young girls, The Sun reported last week.In the documents Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre  says the former US president visited Epsteins infamous private Caribbean Island.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Track-and-trace, launched in May, is essential to keep the virus at bay as Downing Street looks to avoid ato a national lockdown and prioritise containing local clusters of infections.Contact tracing works by stopping the spread of coronavirus through a community, with authorities hoping that by isolating an infected person you can stop the chain of transmission.Three councils in West Yorkshire - Calderdale, Kirklees and Bradford- are now planning to implement their own system after claiming that the national system isnt up to scratch.Calderdale council, which has the sixth highest infection rate in England, told the Mirror they hope their system will be up and running very soon. Bradford council, meanwhile, said that bosses are in talks with Downing Street while Kirklees is in the very early stages.

A spokesman for the Local Government Association, which represents  councils in England told The : “Many people do not answer the phone to any unrecognised numbers. All of us at one time have been pestered by cold callers. For some hard-to-reach people, answering the phone can bring problems being chased for a debt or faced with language dficulties.“We would encourage anyone called by the    number to answer and do their bit to help defeat this virus.But it is also crucial that missed calls can be followed up on the ground by public health experts experienced in contact tracing. The LGA said local authorities were best placed to deal with outbreaks because of their understanding of an area. They said: “Covid- is best understood as a pattern of local outbreaks, rather than a national pandemic with a similar impact in every community, which is why councils as local leaders have a fundamental role to play in the test and trace service.“Councils’ public health teams need to be able to use their unique expertise, including speaking other languages, and understanding of their communities to try to reach those who cannot be contacted by the test and trace system.In Blackburn with Darwen, the local council has launched its own test and trace program to contact potentially infectious residents using local knowledge after failures in the national system. Health officials in Greater Manchester are also looking into setting up their own team of virus tracers to combat the rising tide of cases in the north.Boris Johnson said the test and trace system was absolutely crucial for the Governments coronavirus strategy.If you look at what we are doing with some of the local social distancing measures that we are bringing back in, thats entirely driven by our ability to detect cases through local test and trace, working with our local authorities and taking the right local measures, he said.That is how we hope that we will be able to keep the lid on the disease.Earlier this week, a major study found the UK was facing a second wave of coronavirus by December and the test  trace system was only finding  per cent of contacts of cases. The number falls far below the target of  per cent that Government scientists said needs to be hit. The boss of outsourcing giant Serco has defended the number of people being contacted and asked to isolate as part of the Test and Trace system, saying it is improving all the time.Rupert Soames, CEO of Serco, one of the providers running the test  trace call centres, defended the system claiming it had been blown out of proportion. He told BBC Radio : I think we need to get this into proportion. Youre giving me the numbers saying that were tracing % of contacts, let me tell you that % of the people that we talk to agree to self-isolate.So weve got a very, very high success rate of people that we get to contact.He blamed people being unable to recall who they had met on the failure to reach contacts of cases. He said: If somebody rang you now and I said tell me everybody that you have met, been in contact with, in the last  hours and tell me on the telephone, give me their contact details, how many do you think that youd be able to reel off of the top of your head And the fact is that about % of the contacts that people give us, say I know I sat next so somebody on a bus on the way in but I dont have their contact details. Im sorry, but my brother-in-law brought around a friend last night, I dont have their contact details. So there is an element of that and it is about % at the moment where people cant remember or never knew the contact... the details of where they were.The failed contact tracing app trialled by the Government on the Isle of Wight will be re-launched to help tell people about their infection levels in their area. A version of the app is being developed to help people use their personal information to calculate a risk score, according to The Times. The app was initially hoped to help the contact tracing effort but it failed to be accurate enough to use, and instead the Government backed Google  Apples efforts to develop a contact tracing app. Shadow health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said local authorities needed to be put in the driving seat for the system to be effective. He told BBC Radio : “The problem with the national system, where you effectively get a call from a  number from a call centre run by an outsource company like Serco, is that they are not as effective as the on the ground authority.  “When you look at the statistics, the [local authority] has a much better success rate. That’s because after  hoursSerco can’t get hold of people - which is around  per cent - they pass the contacts over to local public health officials, and they have a success rate of around  per cent.

I urge everyone to get a testyou have symptoms, self-isolate and provide your contacts to NHS Test and Trace so we can continue to keep the virus at bay and get back to normal.Among the other signicant findings from the report was the average number of people infected with Covid- falling from , in May to , in June July and no signicant dferences being detected in the rates of infection by age.However black, Asian and other ethnic minority iniduals were still more likely to test positive than those of white ethnicity.Another study, focusing on the presence of Covid- antibodies throughout the community, is currently underway.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Children were also distanced from their biological parents to be raised by all the adults - while boys and young men were sexually abused by leaders.And in a sinister creed issued by the church, which was set up by former Baptist Noel Stanton in , Elders were instructed to “Beat Adam [sin] out of a child by the age of seven.”The sect - which followed a strict set of rules banning toys, sugar, sweets, TV and all the trappings of a normal childhood - was shut down last May. And now, a leaked report, seen by the BBC, has found that its senior members covered up decades of abuse of women and children.All of the sects five surviving leaders effectively colluded with sex offenders through their handling of complaints, according to the report, which follows an inquiry commissioned by the church in .The leaders must take responsibility for their inaction, said independent investigator, Vicki Lawson-Brown, who also found a culture of “blaming victims” and of disgraced leaders being reinstated.Its a culture that mum-of-three Anna* grew up in.As a young girl in the Jesus Army, regular beatings dished out by the Elders of the commune were part of Annas le from the moment she could walk.Her mum was the single mother of a nine-year-old girl when she fell pregnant for a second time in her twenties. Facing family pressure to have an abortion, she was attracted to the Jesus Army’s non-judgemental message of love – and they welcomed her with open arms.After the birth, Anna, her older sister and her mum moved in to Sheepfold Grange, a sprawling manor house in the Northampton countryside owned by the Church and shared by around  members.At its peak in the early s, the now-dissolved Jesus Army – also known as the Jesus Fellowship Church – had more than , members living in communes in Northamptonshire and around the country.Boys and girls in the sect were forced to be separated, while women wore long skirts and hair because showing ankles and ear was sinful.The statement added: The Trustees repeat our sincere apology, as we have before, to those who have been harmed as a consequence of actions or inactions by those in the Church. The JFCT Trustees acknowledge the trauma of victims and those who have had a negative experience of the Church. JFCT continues to work with victims to help bring closure and compensation through establishing a redress scheme, and through other means.At Sheepfold Grange, Anna and her sister were separated from their mother and “parented” by so-called Brothers and Sisters deemed appropriate by the Elders.“My big sister remembers them beating me at two, Anna tells Sun Online.“They made you choose your own knobbly stick off the bush and I picked a whip-like branch with loads of knots on it, which wasnt a good choice.“That stick hurt so much I climbed on top of the wardrobe where it was kept, and broke the knobbles off  - but I got a beating for that too.“I remember thinking it was goodit just burned,it just felt hot. But the beatings that felt like a cut, like real pain were the worst.”After school and working in the field, the children attended nightly meetings – known as agape– where members prayed, chanted and spoke in tongues.“When I was four, I was sitting in agape wearing a onesie and it was really itchy. One Brother who hated me from a very small age, said, ‘Stop scratching. Thats the devil,she says.“I was desperately trying not to scratch but I was wiggling around so I got beaten.“My mum was constantly told I was possessed by the devil. One of the Brothers would put his hand on top of my head, keeping me at armsand speaking in tongues.I remember desperately trying to wiggle and escape, but I couldnt because he was just pushing on my head.Worldly possessions – including toys, books and radios – were banned, as was all music other than hymns.Children were forbidden to play with school friends, go on school trips or celebrate birthdays and Christmas. And at lunch, they were forced to come home to eat.Snacks, including bananas, were prohibited and only meals from Goodness Foods, the central food store run by the Jesus Army, was allowed.“We weren’t starved,” says Anna. “There would be three meals a day, usually meat, boiled potatoes and vegetables, but it was absolutely vile and you had to eat every bit.”A sexist hierarchy meant that men were considered elite and the women and children worked on the farmland, cooked and cleaned.According to Ms Lawson-Brown, who authored the new leaked report, women were historically regarded as subservient to men and treated as domestic servants, putting them and kids at greater risk of abuse.And Anna claims: “Mum was bottom of the pile because she was a single mother and was seen as a sinner.“I don’t remember seeing Mum much but when I did she looked downtrodden and sad.”Even as a small child, Anna was sent out to London and Birmingham aboard the Jesus Army bus, to evangelize and recruit new members, particularly the homeless.“I remember playing in their cardboard boxes, she says. “They were so accepting and nice, unlike the people I lived with.“We would pick up homeless people, mentally ill people and they’d get in the van and come home with us.“There was no vetting because only God can judge – eventhey were a paedophile.”We revealed last year how homeless and vulnerable men were used as slave labour by the Church, while girls and boys were at the mercy of their superiors and sexually assaulted by adults and other children.Five men have been convicted over the sexual assault of  boys, between the s and s, and police are investigating over  complaints of dferent types of abuse.Solicitor David Greenwood, who is dealing with ongoing cases, said the cult was a totalitarian regime laid down by Noel Stanton which deprived children of their childhood.And in her new review, Ms Lawson-Brown described a signicant case where the surviving leaders, by their failure to act, protected a convicted paedophile allowed to continue in his role as an Elder by Mr Stanton.Anna – who, when she spoke to us last year, had only recently started therapy – says she doesn’t remembershe was sexually abused.She has never spoken to her sister about her experiences, although she remembers her shaking and crying” in bed.Her older sister left when she was  but it was a couple of years later - when Anna was eight - before her mum found the courage to follow.Anna had argued with an Elder at the meal table and was about to get another beating when her mum pulled her away.“It was the first time in my le Id called out to my mum and she’d saved me. We left the next day, she says.After escaping the strict environment of the commune to live with her gran in Northampton, Anna says she went wild and spent her early teens years doing drugs and petty crime, before falling pregnant at .Now settled with three children, Anna says she has friends who have been destroyed by their time in the Jesus Army. But she says she was saved by the birth of her oldest daughter.Another sect survivor, Adam McLeod, was  and homeless when he joined the community after meeting an Elder at a party.Having lost his job, and been thrown out by his mum, he was sofa surfing and was invited to New Creation Farm, where Stanton lived.“The culture was to hug everyone, to show them how much you love them,” he says. “No ones judging you and it just felt amazing.“That drew me in and they took advantage of my vulnerability.”Noel took to Adam immediately, inviting him to move into the farm.Although the founder died in , before the abuse allegations surfaced, some survivors have claimed he was involved in the sexual abuse of young men and other leaders have since been prosecuted.Karl Skinner was given a suspended prison sentence in recent years for inappropriate behaviour with a young boy, and Alan Carter was sentenced to three years in prison for sex acts on a boy aged between  and  in the s.And Adam says the culture of “love” soon turned into something more sinister.“The hugs began to cross lines and there was a lot of inappropriate touching,” he says. “I was young and good looking and I had so many advances from the leaders, even in the prayer meetings.“One guy always came in for a hug and then his hands would wander.“It was a dficult situation. I didnt get confrontational and say ‘Dont touch me.’ I would go along with it and then avoid them.“I didnt tell anyone at the time, because I was very confused.As so many boys were living at the farm, Adam was made to share a single bed every night. He also recalls ritual humiliation, including making him strip naked in front of them when he needed new clothes.On joining the commune, members surrendered all their worldly goods and handed full financial control over to the church.But, in the three years he was there, Adam claims the group financially abused him, using him as slave labour and not paying his debts.“They promise to take away your financial burdens, which was a dream for me as I had debts,” he says.“But I got into a mess because they never kept their promise. I had a car on finance which ended up being repossessed because they never made a payment. The same went for other financial bills.”Adam was made to work full-time in two businesses for no pay.“Because you have no money, you dont have any freedom,” he says. “They controlled everything.“You eat what youre given. I got a lt to and from work every day and they’d bring in my lunch. I was so hungry that I would sneak down to the stockroom and steal energy bars.“Because you are not earning, youre not able to save any money to escape.“I took pride in my appearance and they stripped that away. I was wearing disgusting hand-me-downs and haircuts were done in-house and were hideous.Desperate and unhappy, Adam got back in touch with his mum who finally came to take him home in the middle of the night.Now a property manager, the -year-old says his experience has left permanent damage.“I find it hard to trust people,” he says. “It ruined my confidence.”Another survivor, Maria*, recalls spending Christmas doing back-breaking work on the farm as a -year-old, pulling potatoes from frozen ground from dawn until after dark.She was also sent away from her parents to live at another site, New Creation Farm, when she was  after a nurse of  took a “special interest” in her.“She showered me with letters and cards and regularly telephoned me,” she says.“When I went to stay at the farm, in a cottage that just had women living in it, I was informed thatI went to the toilet I had to leave the door open, andI had a bath I had to let others come into the bathroom.“I found this humiliating but was powerless to protest or do anything about it - I was just a child and no one would listen.“They never sexually abused me but I was sexually exposed and I’m certain that was for the sexual gratication of some.”The church’s financial abuse has had long-term repercussions for one couple – Ian and Jeannie Johnson.Ian joined the church in  after Stanton asked him to help him establish their food business, Goodness Foods.But, after marrying fellow church member Jeannie, who ran the church’s baking business,  he became increasingly disillusioned over financial irregularities.The couple left in , after having children, but more than  years on Jeannie is still paying the price.In  the Jesus Fellowship initiated a disclosure exercise, encouraging anyone who had experienced abuse - or any other negative experience - to bring this to the attention of the church safeguarding office. Information from this process was provided to the Police, who launched an investigation.As a result five offenders were subsequently convicted of non-recent child sexual offences connected to the church. We are appalled that this abuse occurred, and deeply sorry that children were harmed.We also recognise that many people, whilst not having experienced sexual abuse, feel that their experience as children in the Churchs community was damaging, even to the extent of having their adult years signicantly affected. We are deeply sorry that this is the case, unreservedly apologising to these people.The church set up a counselling scheme which has already been much used. The church also started a redress scheme to offer support.Anyone with safeguarding issues or concerns, whether non-recent or current, should report them to the Jesus Fellowship Safeguarding Department , contact the Police directly or the Safeguarding Helpline Thirtyone:eight run by a support organisation independent of the Church -    As the church failed to pay national insurance for their workers, Jeannie’s pension has been left £,-a-year short.Now living in Crete, the couple have been left struggling to cope with medical bills.In the wake of the assault allegations in , a “redress and truth” scheme was set up by the Jesus Fellowship Community Trust and counselling is being offered to those who suffered abuse.But Ian says they have ignored his complaint.“They are saying they cannot help with people already retired,” he says. “And as a registered charity for helping the needy with a boasted £m worth of assets I find it morally wrong.”Many of those affected have come together through the Jesus Fellowship Survivors Association, a growing network of ex-members and services, which offers support and attempts to help them seek compensation.And Ms Lawson-Browns report has recommended further investigations into sexual, spiritual and financial abuse, as well the inappropriate punishment of children.But for many survivors, the anguish continues.I see myself as lucky because I have got a strong mindset, says Anna.Otherwise it would have broken me.*Names changed to protect the identity of the intervieweeOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Motorists must also give way to pedestrians and to cyclists when joining and leaving the roundabout.Reduced lane widths on the roundabout and at exit and entry points are designed to encourage drivers to slow down.Boris Johnson is said to be keen on creating a mini-Holland, and has pledged to build thousands of miles of protected cycleways, Forbes reports.During Prime Ministers Questions on May , the PM also said that the near future should be a golden age for cycling. It comes after locals expressed fears to Cambridgeshire County Council about the old roundabout-located near the citys Addenbrookes Hospital- which was perceived by many people to be dangerous to cycle around. People also reported feeling unsafe when walking in the area due to a lack of pedestrian crossings, particularly more vulnerable users, the authority said.But concerns have been raised over the cost of building the new roundabout, which was originally estimated at around £, but had almost trebled to £. million by the end of the project. A council highways report cited additional utility work including BT and UK Power Networks cabling, as well as the Covid- pandemic, as reasons for this.And some furious locals have said the new system is confusing - with one even branding it a killing zone on Twitter.Reacting to the roundabout, Alice Hodkinson said: Really Bad. This is a cyclist killing zone, like radegund road Perne Road.While Paul Howell added: Cant wait for everyoneto get confused and the accidents to start happening. How about spending the money on road schemes that need it.And local Tony Stark said: Putting pedestrian crossings on these in Cambridge is loading the bullet into a gun. I hope when the accidents start building up, the city council will be willing to pay out as ultimately it will be their fault.The road networks in Cambridge are out dated and can not deal with the current and ever increasing flow. Better road networks should be a priority not further slowing it down and prioritising pedestrian and cycle ways.She added: I feel very safe with this layout, the geometry made it easy to see the cars leaving and approaching the roundabout and the people driving were all giving way to the people cycling and walking.The RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes also backed the decision, saying: Going Dutch will take on a whole new meaning in Cambridge and the council should take credit for trying to improve safety for all road users.For drivers, this may well be an unusual junction to navigate in the first instance, but they should remember that priority must be given to both cyclists and pedestrians as well as the usual give way to vehicles approaching from the right.Some might have concerns about the impact on congestion but ultimately,the scheme reduces collisions and injuries then that will be the true measure of success.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Resorts in the South West of England have reported a high number of the stinging sea creatures this year. Surfers and swimmers are reporting being regularly stung - with some now saying they are too scared to go in the water. And there are dferent types of jellyfish invading the sea, according to reports. One kayaker has shared his images of swarms near the coast. Locals in South Devon have taken a series of images of Compass jellyfish - Chrysaora hysocella - that can give a nasty sting. Explorer and wildle expert Darren Murray captured shots of the Compass jellyfish off Brixham, while in his kayak. Darren Murray, , said that he saw thousands of jellyfish in a mile-long cluster, known as a bloom. He said there were three dferent types, moon, compass - and an eerie blue jellyfish, which could have been Portuguese man o war. Darren, , made his sighting off Brixham, Devon, but reports of sightings have come in from around the South Coast and swimmers are now wary of getting in the sea. He said: There were loads and loads of them, a couple of thousand I reckon. There were three dferent types, moon, compass and a couple of blue ones too. The moon ones donapost sting but the compass do and they can be nasty. Swimmers sometimes get stung on the face and that can be very painful. They come in on high tides. If you see them theyaposre not going to come get you, but you need to be careful around them.  Darren said he sees blooms of jellyfish like this each year, but numbers are increasing. He said: As the sea gets warmer they follow it up and they get trapped against the British coast. It happens each year but itaposs getting earlier and earlier, and the numbers are growing too.  Alongside Brixham, Jellyfish have been spotted in the water off Plymouth, Devon, and in Cornwall including Par, Polzeath, and Falmouth. One swimmer, James Oldfield, , a media worker from Falmouth, said: I hit one while swimming a short while ago, and Iaposve seen loads washed up on the beach. It makes me scared to get into the sea - Iaposve been stung before and the pain lasted for days.

Figures from the Covid Symptom Study app estimate that , people currently have symptomatic Covid in the UK. These figures also highlight that the North currently has higher prevalence rates than the regions in the South. Last week, for the first time, the data science team at ZOE and King’s College London created a aposCovid Symptom Study Watch List,apos which show where the highest estimates of symptomatic Covid in the past week are. The new analysis found that the majority of regions on the watch list are in the North of England. Blackburn with Darwen topped the list, where .% of the population have coronavirus symptoms as of July , which is a rise from the previous week. The number of symptomatic cases in the population is based on the daily new cases and symptoms being logged in the app, whereas incidence rates are simply the number of daily new cases based on the results from swab tests. Blackburn with Darwen was placed into a local lockdown recently following a spike in coronavirus cases. The Covid- infection rate was . cases per , in the week ending July , down from . the week before. Residents in the area cannot meet in dferent households, or people from other households inside pubs and restaurants, as of Friday, July . Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at Kingaposs College London, said the latest data shows the symptoms get worse in the cold weather. “This week, the app also revealed that Covid symptoms and outcomes get worse in colder, less humid weather, which makes it even more important that we get this virus under control as we only have a month or two of warm weather left. Our data suggests that levels have bottomed out at around  cases per day which is too many, so we all need to be conscious of the dangers and to continue to practice high levels of personal hygiene, wear a face mask, social distance and know all the signs of early disease.”  Wrexham was second on the list with .% of the areaaposs population experiencing symptoms. All the reported coronavirus deaths in Wales for the last week have been in one hospital in Wrexham. WalesOnline reports Wrexham Maelor has been the centre of the virus in Wales with one doctor working there apparently describing it as re with Covid. For the seven days, between July  until August , the  deaths were reported in Wales were all at the hospital. Last week, Walesapos First Minister said there was no evidence to support enforcing a local lockdown in Wrexham.  “If the evidence were there that re-openingplaces in those communities would put people at risk then we would take a dferent course of action, but we will rely on the scientic evidence.“It’s why we’ve carried out the mass testing. I think nearly  people will have been tested in those two communities. Data from the symptom app also shows there are currently , daily new cases of Covid in the UK on average over the two weeks up to  July  . Similar to last week, the data suggests that the number of daily new cases in the UK have remained flat since last week. However, the data is beginning to show signs of a North South ide forming again. Mr Spector added: We are now starting to see the figures in the North creep up week on week.  The numbers are still very small so we can’t say with % certainty that Covid is increasing signicantly but it does make us focus on those areas. To understandthese increases are signicant or not, we need as many people as possible in these areas to be logging in the app. "},{"url":null,"title":"heatwave uk brits packed beaches","story":"NewsHeatwave UK: Brits flock to packed beaches ahead of C heatwave on Furnace FridayAround , visitors are expected at Brighton, with , in Bournemouth, , in Great Yarmouth and , in Blackpool as temperatures reach C on Furnace FridayShareByNeil Murphy:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsBrighton Beach is already filling up with hundreds of visitors ahead of a heatwave \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Tomorrow is being dubbed aposFurnace Fridayapos with weather experts predicting it will be the hottest day of the year. Temperatures have skyrocketed to C across Europe thanks to a  mile-wide plume from the Saharan desert. Met Office forecasters say heatwave is expected to last through the weekend, with C possible on Saturday and C on Sunday. This would mean parts of Britain could pass the threshold for an official heatwave, which requires three days of temperatures over C .

Beachgoers flocked to Camber Sands and Brighton Beach in East Sussex as they soaked up the balmy conditions. Around , visitors are expected at Brighton tomorrow, with , in Bournemouth, , in Great Yarmouth and , in Blackpool. Last week on July , the UK recorded the hottest day of the year and the third warmest on record, with the mercury rising to .Cat Heathrow Airport. London and the South East are expected to see the highest temperatures on Friday, but northern areas such as Manchester and Leeds will also hit the low s. Aidan McGivern, also a forecaster for the Met Office, added: “If everything comes together, thereaposs a possibility we will see C or C. C is most likely. “Truly exceptional heat will arrive during Friday as southerly winds waft our way. “Thereaposs a cooling trend over the weekend, with a thundery breakdown in the middle of next week.” “Itaposs deja phew. Sweltering heat is on the way,” said ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weathertrending. The Met Office says that the warmer weather, starting on Thursday, could reach a blistering Cin some areas and is expected to last until Sunday.A spokesman for the Met Office said there was a low chance that last weekaposs record temperature would be beaten again but that large parts of the country would see four or even five consecutive days of incredibly warm temperatures. It is the result of southerly winds moving from Europe and parts of northern Africa, which will push the temperatures up, he said. He added: Itaposs pretty unusual to get two successive events like this within a week of each other with such high temperatures.  The heatwave conditions are expected to last until Sunday before cold air moves in overnight, but conditions are expected to stay hot and humid next week with chances of thundery showers. The RNLI has urged families heading to the beach this week to be aware of potential dangers as the UK braces itself for a potential heatwave.

Anderton Park Primary in Birmingham was one of the schools targeted by anti-gay protesters because of its stance on equality. While children were not formally taught about the importance of challenging stereotypes and treating everyone equally, the ethos of the school meant it was included in all of their values - something Sarah is passionate about. She explained: We weave teaching equality into every day conversations and we talk about how boys and girls are equal throughout the whole school. The adults in school are all good role models and we make sure we watch our language and we challenge stereotypes in school every day. But in February last year, teachers, pupils are parents when a group of protesters set up camp outside the school and home time every day. Most days it could by up to  people and on one harrowing occasion, a group of  protesters turned up and forced Sarah to close the school early. She said: The protests were aggressive and inappropriate outside a school gate. They started at around :pm every day and lasted for  minutes. They were screaming down megaphones, which is completely the opposite of the ethos of the school. We donapost shout, weaposre very harmonious and we have a good relationship with the community and our parents. Sarah spent time talking with parents who had concerns both about the protests and what they believed was being taught at school. She said: We never stopped having these discussions, itaposs really important to have these conversations so we understand them and they understand us. These might be dferent to their beliefs at home and thataposs all part of a healthy society - along with respecting each others views. But itaposs also a pivotal part of education to prepare children for le in modern Britain. Anderton Park staff were forced to take drastic action to ensure as little disruption as possible. They changed the exits the pupils used at the end of every school day to keep them away from the protests - but it still had an impact on the children. Sarah said: The noise was awful. The protests were closest to our youngest children so it was terrible for them, as well as for the staff. But children are very resilient and couldnapost understand what was happening. They all understand equality completely. Sarah, who describes herself as a fiercely proud Brummie, and her team worked closely with Birmingham City Council to try to bring an end to the protests and ended up taking the protesters to court. But despite the ordeal she was putting up with daily, Sarah was never once tempted to back down. She said: Iaposm pretty resilient andanyone is going to take me, then doing it over equality is a good idea because itaposs very important to me. There was no way we were backing down.  If you bow down to one belief, itaposs a slippery slope. If you say itaposs not OK to say that some children have two dads, then you have to bow down to every belief. But it was pretty awful. I felt at one point that my soul had been crushed and I wasnapost sure I was ever going to get it back. I had a lot of good people around me, the brilliant kids at school, the senior leadership team, the staff at school, my two daughters and my partner. Finally, a court granted an injunction which meant the protesters had to be a certain distance from the school. While the children could still hear them, it wasnapost as threatening as it had been. Finally, last November, the courts granted an injunction that officially moved the protesters on.  Now the protesters are finally gone - although a few arrived when school started back again in September - Sarah has had a new crisis to deal with. The coronavirus pandemic. While Anderton Park has been empty of pupils for several months its headteacher has been a regular within its walls. Sarah cleared the schoolaposs freezers and food cupboards to provide food parcels for struggling families. A third of the pupils at the school are entitled to free school meals and with large families and small budgets common, many didnapost have access to the tehcnology to enable them to learn from home.

When Rishi announced the scheme he said: From September, homeowners and landlords will be able to apply for vouchers to make their homes more energy efficient and create local jobs. In his latest email, Martin has shared updates on exactly what this scheme will allow and why some people could be set to miss out. He said: The Government has now released more details on its Green Home Grant, including eligibility and what it covers. Those who just planned on getting double glazing will miss out.  Under the scheme the government grant will aim to cover at least two thirds of the cost of improvement, up to £, per household. However some low income households will be able to get the entire cost covered, up to £,. But to be able to claim any vouchers, property homeowners need to also be installing insulation or low carbon heating at the same time. Those who already have those features in their home can get top ups, such as additional loft insulation.

The Duchess of Sussex gave birth to baby Archie at Londonaposs Portland Hospital on May  last year. In line with royal tradition, Kate Middleton gave birth to all three of her children at the Lindo Wing of St Maryaposs Hospital in Paddington, following in the footsteps of Princess Diana who also had her children there. In new biography Find Freedom, authors Omid Scoobie and Carolyn Durrand say it was never the plan for Meghan to give birth at the royal favourite. They write: Meghan never considered giving birth at St Maryaposs Hospital in London, where Kate delivered all three of her children. It is reported in the book that Meghan always planned on having a more discreet birth. Whereas crowds gathered for days outside the Lindo Wing waiting for a glimpse of Kate and Williamaposs royal babies, Meghan and Harry did not share any details about Archie immediately after the birth. There were no crowds and instead Meghan and Harry made their debut with their son days later in front of just a handful of photographers and one Press Association reporter. Meghan said parenthood was pretty magic, adding itaposs pretty amazing. She went on to say she had two best guys in the world, so Iaposm really happy.  Months after the birth of baby Archie, the Sussexes announced they were stepping down as senior members of the royal family. They quit royal le for a more private family le in America, where they now live in a multi-million Bervely Hills mansion. Omid Scobie has joined fellow journalist Carolyn Durand to pen Finding Freedom, which tells the story of the coupleaposs decision to quit the royal family.  Speaking ahead of its release next month, Scobie tells People magazine: A lot of damage has been done. The book talks about the fallout between the brothers and wives, claiming Meghan and Kate had a strained relationship from day one. They write: Though it was not necessarily her responsibility, Kate did little to bridge the ide. However Scobie and Durand claim that despite their dferences, the two women didnapost get on, rather they simply had nothing in common and there were some awkward moments.

Shockwaves smashed building facades, sucked furniture out into streets and shattered windows miles inland. Images of of the aftermath show how warehouses and storage units surrounding the blast zone now lie in ruins. Rescue crews are still searching area in an attempt to retrieve bodies from homes flattened by the blast. Beirutaposs port - the epicentre of the explosion - was once one of the regionaposs busiest but has now been reduced to virtually nothing. Other satellite pictures show the Orient Queen cruise ship capsized due to the force of the blast Up to a quarter of a million people were left without homes fit to live in while the damage is expected to cost around bn . The death toll was expected to rise from the blast, which officials blamed on a huge stockpile of highly explosive material stored for years in unsafe conditions at the port.  This explosion seals the collapse of Lebanon. I really blame the ruling class, said Hassan Zaiter, , a manager at the heavily damaged Le Gray Hotel in downtown Beirut. Relatives gathered at a cordon to Beirut port seeking information on those still missing as the search continued. Many of those killed were port and custom employees, people working in the area or those driving nearby during the Tuesday evening rush hour. Some victims were hurled out to sea by the powerful blast. The Red Cross was coordinating with the Health Ministry to set up morgues as hospitals were overwhelmed. Health officials reported that hospitals were running out of beds and equipment to attend to the injured. Beirutaposs Clemenceau Medical Center was like a slaughterhouse, blood covering the corridors and the lts, said Sara, one of its nurses. The explosion was the most powerful ever in Beirut, a city still scarred by civil war that ended three decades ago and reeling from an economic meltdown and a surge in coronavirus infections.The blast rattled buildings on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, about  milesaway. No words can describe the horror that has hit Beirut last night, turning it into a disaster-stricken city, President Michel Aoun said in an address to the nation during an emergency cabinet session. Aoun said , tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs, was stored for six years at the port after it was seized.The government was determined to investigate and expose what happened as soon as possible, to hold the responsible and the negligent accountable, he said.

Footage shows Dr Seblani, , who works in the US, smiling and looking radiant in her dress, but as photographer Mahmoud Nakib pans the camera down to a bouquet on the floor there is a deafening roar and the whole area shakes as the force of the blast blows the train on the wedding gown. The camera then shows a street that is filled with dust and debris as buildings fall apart and windows are blown out by the powerful shockwave that nearly blows the bride off her feet. Have you been affected by the explosion  Email webnews@mirror. Tuesdayaposs blast killed  people, injured more than , and left dozens missing as rescuers searched through mounds of rubble. Still in her wedding dress, Dr Seblani helped to check on the injured nearby, before fleeing central Beirutaposs Sai square to safety. Later, as she spoke to a Reuters journalist, she and her husband, a businessman in Beirut, were struggling to process what happened. She said: I have been preparing for my big day for two weeks and I was so happy like all other girls, aposI am getting marriedapos. My parents are going to be happy seeing me in a white dress, I will be looking like a princess.What happened during the explosion here - there is no word to explain ... I was shocked, I was wondering what happened, am I going to die  How am I going to die  Behind her, piles of smashed glass from the blown-out windows of the hotel where she was due to stay littered the ground, along with crushed remnants of flower arrangements that had adorned banquet tables. Dr Seblani arrived in Beirut three weeks earlier to prepare for her wedding. Mr Subeih recalled the aftermath of the blast, which officials have blamed on a huge stockpile of highly explosive material - , tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs - stored for years in unsafe conditions at the port. He said: We started to walk around and it was extremely sad, it was not describable the devastation and the sound of the explosion. We are still in shock ... I have never heard anything similar to the sound of this explosion. Dr Seblani added: I feel so sad about what happened to other people, about what happened to Lebanon. When I woke up [on Wednesday morning] and saw the damage that happened to Beirut, the one thing I said was thank God we are still alive.  After the blast, she and her husband tried to compose themselves and carry on with their celebrations. She said: My husband told me to continue, we canapost stop. I was like okay, why not, we continue. I was not living the moment actually, I was like walking, my face was smiling, my lips were smiling, thataposs it, not more. Then we went to have a dinner. Mr Subeih recalls entering the damaged hotel on Wednesday to retrieve belongings and passports. He said: The scene in the room was unbelievable.He is waiting for a visa to the United States so he can join his we there. Dr Seblani loves Lebanon, but feels that after Tuesdayaposs blast, living there is not an option. She is still trying to find joy in a wedding she took so long to prepare. The bride said: There is a lot of damage, many people were killed and wounded. But alsoI want to look at us, myself, my husband, the photographer - how we escaped unharmed, I thank God for protecting us."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/08/2.42584093-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/08/2.42584093-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/08/2.42584093-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/08/2.42584093-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"cops raided teen pervs angus home as he was downloading sick images","story":"A teenage pervert was in the middle of downloading sick child images when police raided his home.The -year-old, who cannot be named because of his age, had been accessing hundreds of indecent images and videos of children since the age of , Dundee Sherf Court heard.A sherf placed the teen on the sex offender’s register after he pleaded guilty to downloading the vile stash from an address in Letham.It was revealed that some of the material was in the highest level of depravity.Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson said police obtained a search warrant for the youth#s home where they found him and his father.A laptop was seized and a preview examination found indecent images of children.The teen, a first offender who has diagnosed autism, was thereafter arrested.“A full examination found three laptops that were using file-to-file sharing software,” Ms Robertson told the court.“These had been used to download most of the material.

He does the horrible side of being a striker very well, the side that his team-mates appreciate.“He is a team player but he has real quality as well. That’s the reason Jack Ross took him early to St. Mirren and speaking to Jack he was a massive factor in them being promoted.“He brings a lot more than just goals as a striker, he can take the ball in and for his size he holds the ball up and he is a bit of a bully at times. Danny is what we have been missing and that’s why I was so desperate to get him since January.”The Dark Blues just missed out on the striker at the end of the January transfer window as they sought a replacement for the departed Danny Johnson.“It was a frustrating one in January it went to the last   minutes of the deadline. He would have been involved in the game at Morton the next day the same way the other signings were.“He is a player who I have known for a while, he has plenty of admirers in Scottish football and you can see why.“I think it would have happened earlierit hasn’t been for the circumstances but I’m delighted to get it over the line.”After a summer of worry over the finances at the club brought by the coronavirus shutdown, prompting the first-team players and staff to take wage cuts and the budget for the academy being slashed, McPake gave an upbeat assessment of what the future holds on the playing side of things.On plans tofor pre-season ahead of the October restart, McPake said: “It’s going OK. Like everything that’s happening, it’s changing daily and it’s hard to put down anything.“What I will say is the response from the players and the fans, there is a feelgood factor, which feels strange to say.“I feel good being back around the place. I know the players are itching to get back but there are protocols and measures [to be gone through].“What we have is time on our side to prepare for a season. The important thing we said was getting a date for the season to start but we are governed by the other people that make decisions.“We are doing what is the safest for Dundee Football Club and what we feel will benefit Dundee Football Club the most.“In terms of my planning, I’m very happy with the way things are going and everyone  is fit and healthy which is also important.”Mullen joined former Dunfermline defender Lee Ashcroft as a new signing at the club and McPake is pleased with his new additions.He added: “We are in the middle of a pandemic and deals are short but you are starting to see teams signing players now. Both of the players had other offers so their commitment to come here ahead of others clubs shows they believe in what we are trying to do and achieve at Dundee Football Club.“Like Lee, who we tried to get last summer, Danny we had asked about from the start of December. And it went all the way to the last day. These are players we’ve admired for a while. The two signings we’ve brought in, delighted so far.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Those that worked hard, irrespective of their environment and demographic, were successful.“The results for this past academic sessionwould give great cause for concern and alarm to all those with a keen interest in educating our young people.”Mr Funai has asked Dundee politicians MSPs and MPs to consider which schools gained the most from the examination boards grading system.He added: “I would like an explanation as to how it is possible for two young people from two dferent schools from dferent demographic areas and who produce top quality work in mathematics be awarded gradesthe evidence and teacher estimates are the same “For me there can only be one answer: The school attended by these young people.“I have seen some of the evidence and know it to be very strong when comparing it to previous standard and requirements set out by the SQA.“Having taught and witnessed success and failure across a wide range of schools it is incomprehensible to me how this disparity can be.”Exam results: Grading of this year#s exams labelled a #travesty# by concerned teachers\" title\"#Exam results: Grading of this year#s exams labelled a #travesty# by concerned teachers# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp exam-results-grading-of-this-years-exams-labelled-a-travesty-by-concerned-teachers embed # secretsoRSzAad\" data-secret\"soRSzAad\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"The Scottish Government has defended the results, claiming it was necessary to ensure credibility.The SQA said this year’s results saw an increase in the number of disadvantaged young people gaining Highers.A spokesman said: “We believe we have delivered fairness to learners, through a consistent, evidence based approach in the absence of exams.“We have maintained the integrity and credibility of our qualications system, ensuring that standards are maintained over time, in the interest of learners, through judicious moderation of grades.“The most disadvantaged young people have achieved better results in  compared to both  and the average results for the last four years.“At grades A to C, the attainment gap between the most and least disadvantaged young people is also narrower this year for National , Higher and Advanced Higher than for last year or the average gap for the last four years.”Pupils who did not receive the grade they were expecting can use the SQA#s free appeal service.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

Recognition value within his own party may even be a moot point .Yet the -year-old north east native apparently believes he has what it takes to lead the Scottish Tories to victory in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election and achieve what his biggest supporter, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, failed to do: become First Minister.Despite no public profile to speak of and very little time to build one, Mr Rossrsquos approach over the last few days has certainly been bold. Ruthless, even, in way he and the party swept Jackson Carlaw aside.You get the feeling his campaign team hope for a Barack Obama-style recognition trajectory: at the beginning of  few knew who Obama was by the end of that year he was US President. If Mr Rossrsquos first approach to voters is anything to go by, however, the political figure we may be soon be comparing him to is Jo Swinson. Team Ross would be well-advised to learn lessons from the former Lib-Dem leaderrsquos disastrous  general election campaign, not least how poorly she communicated with voters in Scotland.Itrsquos early days, obviously, and Mr Ross hasnrsquot even been elected party leader yet, though this looks like a coronation rather than a competition. But the piece Mr Ross wrote for a newspaper yesterday, setting out his stall, was ill-conceived to say the least. Indeed, the sort of undecided voter his party desperately needs to pick up over the next few months may have found themselves themselves wincing, even chuckling, at some of the tone-deaf rhetoric.Herersquos an example. Near the beginning of the Sunday Times article Mr Ross states that ldquoa decade and more of nationalist government has left Scotland a ided country. Many readers, even those who donrsquot support the SNP, may immediately find themselves thinking about the how a decade of Tory government at Westminster has indeed left Scotland ided. Between the haves and the have nots. Between the working and the working poor. Between those who benefit from employment rights and those left at the mercy of the so-called gig-economy. Between those who rely on deliberately-underfunded public services and those who donrsquot have to.ldquoItrsquos the nature of nationalism to ide, Mr Ross goes on, seemingly without a hint of irony. The Little England narrative peddled by Boris Johnson and his cronies delivered Brexit at the ballot box, a isive and disastrous outcome that the vast majority of Scots remain economically, socially and ideologically opposed to.Letrsquos see how a no deal Brexit on  December - an outcome engineered and encouraged by a game-playing Prime Minister roundly despised and distrusted in Scotland - works out for Mr Rossrsquos Holyrood campaign. Such a result would undoubtedly heap even more misery upon Scottish businesses already on the brink after what will, by the end of the year, be -months of Covid--related downturn.Mr Ross is apparently a keen supporter of Boris JohnsonMaybe he truly believes he can influence Mr Johnson on Brexit policy where Ruth Davidson, David Mundell and Jackson Carlaw failed.But there lies the fundamental, inescapable rub for Scottish Tories. It doesnrsquot matter who leads them. They are shackled to a UK party that appears to revel in acting against the best interests of Scotland.Those most committed to the Union will still cast their votes for the party next May. They have nowhere  to go.But polls over the last few months have detected a sht. The size of this steadfastly pro-Union group looks like it is decreasing, largely due to Brexit. Younger voters remain overwhelmingly in support of independence.In a bid to counter this, Mr Ross refers throughout the aforementioned article to patriotism, a term associated with the sort of brash Brexiteers most in Scotland canrsquot stand, and is surely no less problematic than ldquonationalism.The architects of his campaign - among them Michael Gove - have little choice but to focus on ldquosaving the Union. But how do you even begin to do this when your own party works against you at every turn  That remains the enduring, unanswerable question for whoever leads the Scottish Tories."},{"url":null,"title":"exam-results-simply-add-opinion-brian-beacom","story":"Of course, TV never records the tear-stained, snot-nosed physiognomy of those who wonrsquot make it into uni with those grades, who will have to face not only their parentsrsquo ire but their own sense of abject hopelessness for months to come.Do results make much dference to young lives  The Simpsons cartoon series once set the scene perfectly for debate: Bart Simpson revels as the brash go-getter to whom school is simply a detainment centre until he succeeds as a little Lord Sugar.

Young people are facing a Covid-ravaged future, with a fight to find jobs that will demand the inner strength and conviction of an Albus Dumbledore.But to make matters worse, Covid has wrecked traditional exam testing and replaced it with a new system, whereby SQA moderated grades estimated by teachers based on several unclear factors.The result was chaos. Twenty-five per cent of schoolsrsquo recommendations were ignored by SQA, using a methodology as suspect as the contention that Mr Chips chose to spend his time entirely in the company of young boys ndash despite having experienced a short le with the gorgeousness that was Greer Garson, at least in the film anyway.Why didnrsquot the SQA simply support the track and trace system, whereby teachers, who know the pupils implicitly, provide all the necessary background info, backed by faculty heads and senior management Education Secretary John Swinney boasted ldquoThree quarters of all gradings have required no moderation. What of the  per cent SQA have altered  Why have they been altered  What algorithms ndash or benchmarks have been used Have the SQA proportioned a set number of passes to match up with schoolsrsquo previous records  One teacher said yesterday ldquoI know of a pupil who achieved a History Higher pass mark, a lsquoCrsquo, who had barely attended class prior to Covid.

Why, particularly in a time when pupils have never been less at school, their lives never thrown into such disarray  How can the evaluation process be robust The worry then is that this is quantitative easing in educational form, printing passes in order to remove the duncersquos cap from his own head.The Government also argues the dferential between state and private schools has narrowed. But perhaps it would be even narrower had the SQA not been involved There are tactics and strategies here wersquore not being told about and they make a mockery of the teaching profession.

It all smacked of a pair who realised they were facing a seat outside the headmasterrsquos office for not doing their homework.As a result, many fragile, frustrated, confused young minds first major move in le will see them battle the SQArsquos appeal process.What kind of start is this for someone who has been isolated for months, unable to be part of the traditional teaching process If we donrsquot judge people by the colour of their skin why should we judge those who donrsquot get five lsquoArsquos  But we will.

Our \"leadership\" seems intent on taking out our young.Steve Brennan, Coatbridge.THE Scottish Government has no right to congratulate itself over the apparent general increase in pupil grades. Whilst the Covid- crisis has placed severe strain on the examining bodies, its solution is quite imperfect and works to the advantage of some and, more importantly, to the disadvantage of many others.Less able pupils in well-performing schools will likely be awarded grades beyond their inidual ability and the brightest pupils in poorly performing schools will be downgraded.Teachers may well apply results fairly based on their assessments of pupilsrsquo performance, but these are being moderated according to schoolsrsquo histories of achievement andthese are poor then pity the bright pupils.Good luck to those who have derived advantage from this system but it must not be to the disadvantage of those who have lost out.

It has become a focus of discontent as Scotland is shoe-horned into a new UK internal market replacing the EU single market.There is another way. Over the past couple of years there has been talk in Unionist circles of a new Act of Union to cement the new post-Brexit relationship. The Prime Minister is thought to be interested in something dramatic that would redefine relationships in this ldquoawesome foursome, as he calls Britain.The unionist columnist Stephen Daisley put flesh on the bones in an article this week. This new Act of Union would, in his model, restore the sovereignty of Westminster in a unitary UK state. It would define what the powers of the Scottish Parliament are, instead of leaving them open-ended as is the case in the  Scotland Act.ldquoBring it on, says Nicola Sturgeon.

It could even come in the form of a new Treaty of Union, as in , to embrace a new constitutional reality.Such a treaty would recognise that Scotland and England still want to be part of Great Britain, as it also said in . But it would start from the premise that Scotland is a country in its own right. That Scotland voluntarily relinquished its sovereignty in , but now intends to run its own affairs in a new legal partnership.This New Union would recognise that Scotlandrsquos Parliament exercises entrenched constitutional powers: something that was promised in the post-ldquoVow Scotland Act in , but wasnrsquot delivered, as the Supreme Court ruled in .This New Union would be regarded by diehard unionistas a capitulation: not so much an Act of Union as an Act of Disunion. However, it could also be the creation of a new Union of equals ndash one that draws on the past but recognises changed realities.Like the European Union, this Union would be a legally-binding partnership of nominally independent countries. It would be defined by a commitment to common economic, social and environmental objectives, free movement, human rights, common trading standards, mutual defence and a common currency.Giving Holyrood full economic powers, including tax and borrowing, but within the confines of a common currency, would keep Scotland within the tent, much as countries like Slovakia and Slovenia are within the European Union. They are both sovereign countries, but their currency is the euro, they obey the Maastricht stability rules on debt and accept Brusselsrsquo right to regulate trade and negotiate treaties on their behalf.Scotland would be in charge of most of its own affairs, but would remain part of a United Kingdom under the Queen. That this echoes  Independence White Paper, Scotlandrsquos Future, drafted by one Nicola Sturgeon, is no accident. That was not a prospectus for separation, but for confederalism, as some of us argued at the time.After all, what does Westminster really need from Scotland  It needs a common travel area, a viable internal market, a common currency, defence and mutual security. Thatrsquos really it. England doesnrsquot need the hassle and expense of the day-to-day running of Scotland it just needs a recognition that Great Britain still exists as a geopolitical entity and that the UK is a unitary economic space ndash just like the EU.This kind of relationship would make sense following Brexit. Scotland would cease to be a Barnett supplicant. The Scottish Government would have to take responsibility for managing economic affairs within the constraints of legally-binding Treaty obligations.I think Dominic Cummings would be all over this. I think Sir Keir Starmer might be too. A new Union that saves Britain from Balkanisation and emphasises solidarity and common interests would be supported by the Liberal Democrats.Indeed, it is not inconceivable that Ms Sturgeon might see some merit in an Act of Disunion. It gets her off the referendum hook and would allow her to claim that Scotland was becoming independent, not by conflict and disruption as in Catalonia, but through reasoned discussion and negotiation.At any rate, something has to be done. Britain finally leaves Europe in the New Year ndash just in time for the Holyrood elections, which promise to be a blood bath for the unionist parties. Boris Johnson canrsquot just pretend itrsquos business as usual. Offering more cash backed by dark threats wonrsquot wash.Scotland needs to be sorted so he can concentrate on Brexit.

However, it could also be the creation of a new Union of equals ndash one that draws on the past but recognises changed realities.Like the European Union, this Union would be a legally-binding partnership of nominally independent countries. It would be defined by a commitment to common economic, social and environmental objectives, free movement, human rights, common trading standards, mutual defence and a common currency.Giving Holyrood full economic powers, including tax and borrowing, but within the confines of a common currency, would keep Scotland within the tent, much as countries like Slovakia and Slovenia are within the European Union. They are both sovereign countries, but their currency is the euro, they obey the Maastricht stability rules on debt and accept Brusselsrsquo right to regulate trade and negotiate treaties on their behalf.Scotland would be in charge of most of its own affairs, but would remain part of a United Kingdom under the Queen. That this echoes  Independence White Paper, Scotlandrsquos Future, drafted by one Nicola Sturgeon, is no accident. That was not a prospectus for separation, but for confederalism, as some of us argued at the time.After all, what does Westminster really need from Scotland  It needs a common travel area, a viable internal market, a common currency, defence and mutual security. Thatrsquos really it. England doesnrsquot need the hassle and expense of the day-to-day running of Scotland it just needs a recognition that Great Britain still exists as a geopolitical entity and that the UK is a unitary economic space ndash just like the EU.This kind of relationship would make sense following Brexit. Scotland would cease to be a Barnett supplicant. The Scottish Government would have to take responsibility for managing economic affairs within the constraints of legally-binding Treaty obligations.I think Dominic Cummings would be all over this. I think Sir Keir Starmer might be too. A new Union that saves Britain from Balkanisation and emphasises solidarity and common interests would be supported by the Liberal Democrats.Indeed, it is not inconceivable that Ms Sturgeon might see some merit in an Act of Disunion. It gets her off the referendum hook and would allow her to claim that Scotland was becoming independent, not by conflict and disruption as in Catalonia, but through reasoned discussion and negotiation.At any rate, something has to be done. Britain finally leaves Europe in the New Year ndash just in time for the Holyrood elections, which promise to be a blood bath for the unionist parties. Boris Johnson canrsquot just pretend itrsquos business as usual. Offering more cash backed by dark threats wonrsquot wash.Scotland needs to be sorted so he can concentrate on Brexit. If and when the SNP wins a majority in Mayrsquos Scottish elections, the Prime Minister should show true Churchillian radicalism by offering his own Plan B ndash challenging Scotland to join a new partnership of equals.

For the countryrsquos exam regulator, and by extension the Scottish Government, have made a right porcus auris of matters .To recap. With exams cancelled for the first time due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was left to teachers to estimate the grades a pupil could expect, and then the SQA would step in to moderate the result up or down. Not ideal, but this was an unprecedented situation, best that could be done in the circumstances, good intentions all round, autofill as required.Yet from the outset the most important part of the process, the moderation of results, was shrouded in mystery, like the recipe for some secret sauce. MSPs, teachers and others had asked for details of the methodology to be used, but details came there none until the day the results were published, when it was too late to do anything about it.As it turned out, the SQA has been less than moderate in its moderation, with a quarter of results, some ,, downgraded.Digging deeper, pupils from the most deprived areas were more likely to have their grades downgraded than those from the least deprived areas. Among the latter the dference between estimated and actual results was . per cent. In the most deprived areas it was .%.In making its decisions, the SQA considered a schoolrsquos past results. It was not the only consideration but it was key. So it did not matter how hard a pupil had worked all year, and what their teacherrsquos assessment was: the fix was in from the start. Postcode determined outcome, and once the downgrading began one domino toppled on to the next, right down to a predicted pass becoming a fail.As Lindsay Paterson, Professor of Education Policy at the University of Edinburgh, wrote in The Herald: ldquoItrsquos bad enough to know that you have been given a B instead of an A because of what previous students achieved in your school.ldquoBut to know you have failed a course because the SQA judged your teachers to be unreliable in making judgments is offensive.: Fears teachers will be overwhelmed by appealsOffence has duly been taken by pupils, their parents, and teachers alike, and no wonder. Once again, those Scots youngsters most in need of a fair shake have been shoved to the back of the queue through no fault of their own. All in the name, in the words of the SQA, of \"maintaining the integrity of the system.Had the results gone unmoderated, we are told by ministers, the pass rates would have risen to the highest on record. We could not have that, right  If pupils from poorer backgrounds genuinely began catching up with those from better-off areas then why shell out for private school fees  Andwe start down that road where will it all end Well, we could end up with an approach to Scottish education that was more in keeping with reality than the rose-tinted, wharsquos like us nonsense we traditionally feed ourselves. You can see this vainglory in action on the SQArsquos own website, a destination much to be recommendedyou are partial to hollow laughter. There, you will learn that the SQA is ldquothe heart of Scotlandrsquos world-renowned education system.Would this be the same world-renowned education system that has seen Scotland fall down the international Pisa rankings in maths and science and struggle to keep up in reading We also learn that the SQA offers ldquoglobally recognised qualications and services to realise your potential. Those pupils who have had results downgraded were not realising their potential ndash they were being judged on the performance of their predecessors.: Job market extremely tough for youngstersAs for the SQArsquos proclaimed values ndash ldquoprogressive, enabling, trusted ndash the quango might want to have another look at those, particularly the last one, lest those snorts of laughter turn to bitter gales.The Scottish Government, headed by a First Minister who said closing the attainment gap was a ldquodefining challenge for any administration she led, has not had the easiest of summers when it comes to education. There was the U-turn over plans for a partialto school, and now fresh turmoil caused by the SQArsquos downgrading of results.It has been a tough time for a lot of people, parents especially, but the answer does not lie in piling unfairness on to existing inequality, as the SQArsquos downgrading has done.Its next task is dealing with the thousands of expected appeals. On that the SQA should do what it promised in the first place and properly consult teachers.Instead of viewing teachers as biased towards their own pupils, think of them as professional observers whose opinions are as worthy of respect as your own.The Government needs to take a grip of the situation and fast, not just for the sake of current pupils but those that come after. It is possible, in the absence of a vaccine, that we could be in the same situation next year.The Scottish education system cannot take any more dunts to its reputation. It has nothing to do with some notion of national pride. It is about being serious when we say we believe in fairness and equality. It is about understanding the problems and addressing them as quickly as possible. It is about priorities.This Government has had  years to make a dference.

Mr Ross has already touched on this in his initial thoughts on the leadership ndash he would like more power to be shared out from Edinburgh and, as an Aberdonian like Mr Ross, I approve. Holyrood should not be the full-stop of devolution.Mr Rossrsquos roots in Aberdeen also, I think, may explain other parts of his political thinking. Much of Scotlandrsquos image as a place of radical politics was formed to the sound of the hammer and the pickaxe ndash it came from the shipyards and factories and coal mines, and because of that, Glasgow became the capital of Scotlandrsquos radicalism, first with Labour and now with the SNP.But the radicalism of Glasgow is not the whole story. In the Highlands, therersquos a much more liberal tradition, and the further north you go, the more liberal it gets, while up in Aberdeen and down in Dumfries-shire and the Borders, therersquos a strong streak of conservatism. In Aberdeen, some of it may come from our cautious natures: radicalism equals change, and we donrsquot like change.As Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross has the capacity to tap into those feelings, but therersquos an extra factor which may work in his favour in the way it did for Ruth Davidson. Mr Ross is not a Tory toff or the kind of Anglicised Scot that used to represent the Tories. Hersquos from an ordinary background and his views and instincts reflect what a lot of other Scots from ordinary backgrounds think.Take his call for ldquotougher enforcement against Gypsy Travellers for instance. The SNP immediately cried ldquoracist! before downgrading it to ldquoabhorrent!, but itrsquos perfectly fair to be concerned about illegal camps, and this is where the metropolitan effect kicks in again: middle-class, city liberals assume everyone thinks like they do, on race, sex, gender, or Brexit, but they donrsquot. Many Scots in large parts of the country are more cautious and conservative.The SNPrsquos tactic on all of this ndash and itrsquos already wobbled ndash is to portray Mr Rossrsquos conservatism as extreme, but actually he is from a Scottish tradition of right-of-centre pragmatic conservatism that still exists. Take his views on Brexit. The SNP said he had ldquofailed to stand up for Scotland by backing an extreme Brexit but he is merely taking the view that a lot of centrist Scots now take: we voted Remain but letrsquos try to get the best Brexit we can.Mr Rossrsquos common sense was also at work in the Dominic Cummings affair. He was the only minister to resign over it, saying he could not in good faith defend a government advisor who had travelled hundreds of miles during the initial stages of lockdown, and his resignation was a good sign for his future as Scottish Tory leader. If he erges from the rest of the UK party when he sees fit, as Ruth Davidson did, it will serve him well.All of these factors could help Mr Ross connect with voters in the centrist middleas well as a large part of conservative Scotland including the socially conservative working-class parts of urban Scotland. But the problem he has is that hersquos taking over during a public health crisis in which the SNP government is seen to be doing well. It is this, perversely, that has helped support for independence to edge over %: the less Nicola Sturgeon has talked about independence, the more people have supported it.The question is: what happens when le s to normality in Scotland ie the SNP banging on about independence every day  It was frustration with that approach among ordinary Scots ndash and Ruth Davidsonrsquos plain-speaking ability to capitalise on it ndash that led to the Tory surge in . Could it happen again under Mr Ross To be honest, at the moment, itrsquos hard to see how ndash the circumstances of  are unlikely to repeat themselves in time for the next Scottish election.

especially in Texas, Florida and Arizona - just skyrocketing in that demographic.ldquoItrsquos just that smouldering fire - but as more of them get infected, the chance of them interacting with the vulnerable population increases and hits that vulnerable population, and then the inferno just begins.ldquoThatrsquos when we end up with lots of sickness and lots of disease.The problem for politicians and public health experts is how to persuade a vast swathe of the population to take the threat of coronavirus seriously when, in reality, they are extremely unlikely to become critically unwell, let alone die.According to a study by experts in epidemiology and infectious disease at Stanford University, the risk of someone under  dying in the UK from Covid was equivalent to the chances of them dying in a car crash -

who are nonetheless equally capable of catching and spreading the infection, often without symptoms - flout the rules, the more cases will increase, and the more chance there is of the virus eventually reaching people who will get sick.But it is very challenging psychologically to link apparently harmless behaviour, such as sitting too close to too many people in a pub, to the potential to set off a chain of events that could culminate in a strangers hospitalisation.ldquoItrsquos about our risk to others, and that might make it a little more dficult to understand, says Cynthia Rohrbeck, an associate professor in clinical and community psychology at George Washington University.: Warning over surgery backlog as around , operations postponedHuman judgment is also clouded by optimism bias: the tendency to believe you are less likely than others to experience something negative.In February, researchers polled , people in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland and found half of them believed they were less likely to get the coronavirus than others, without any sound evidence for that belief.Our behaviour is also governed by the reward principle: put simply, we are more likely to follow the ruleswe perceive a personal reward, or benefit, to our actions.Not getting sick might be a reward - butyou already know that the statistics are stacked in your favour and, as time goes on, you dont fall ill, the motivation to comply flags.In trying to keep a lid on the pandemic as lockdown eases, we essentially face an uphill battle against human psychology.

Consequently, that would have of course laid bare the lack of success in general in improving the lot of the working class, the \"levelling-up\" of society, closing the attainment gap, improving social mobility.. The model employed based on previous records, actually reinforces the attainment gap and now we have the statistics to prove it. Any occurrence of improvement is considered a mere blip on the graph the blip represents the hopes and ambitions of a human being.The whole process smacks of inertia in the face of adversity, compounding the calamity visited upon us. The lack of respect for the teaching profession by the Government is a disgrace. It now dictates that, not only do teachers pick up the pieces but risk their health in the process. It seeks to enlist more teachers to deal with the conditions Covid sets it will be fortunate to convince teachers in post to remain.Maureen McGarry-OHanlon, Balloch.THE SQA, by setting its historical precedent to downgrade students results on the grounds of the areas their schools were in, has delivered an almighty and metaphorical slap in the face to all those teachers who in all sincerity presented the grades they felt their students merited on the basis of their performances throughout their abbreviated certicate year. This decision has called into question the professionalism of the classroom practitioners.What is also inexcusable is the the degradation imposed upon the high hopes of pupils who were clearly A students by the devaluation of their efforts.As a former member of the profession, I can safely testy that a teacher knows an A student when the teacher sees one.No teachers worthy of the name would tamper with a students results, knowing full well that this would be to the detriment of a pupils future.There can be no doubt that the SQA was placed in a dficult situation as a result of the Covid- shutdown, but it ought to have shown more resilience and sensitivity in its approach to the delivery of results which should have reflected the reality of the actual performance of any student rather than the historical performance of any school.There can be no doubt that we will hear much more about this unhappy state of affairsDenis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.NICOLA Sturgeon says she wishes to be judged on her ability to close the education achievement gap between the better-off and the poorest in Scotland. A worrying aspect of the SQA fiasco is the fact that it seems designed to reinforce the achievement gap and even embed it in the system. By choosing to dictate that able students from poorer families cannot be given credit beyond some statistical average it sends the message that they shouldnt even bother trying.Given that the rules for Scottish university entrance favour middle-class EU applicants over working-class Scottish students, you would be forgiven for believing that, far from wishing to close the gap by improving the lot of our less-well-off, the SNP is designing a system which reinforces an already unfair disadvantage and bakes that disadvantage into the system, to the further detriment of working-class Scottish pupils.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.AND now for some facts.Those exam results were assessments by the teachers. You know, the folk who know the pupils. They were not by the Scottish Government or by John Swinney. They were presented to the SQA, the body that supervises exams in Scotland. It felt some of the assessments were a bit generous. So it marked them down a little. These amended results still show an improvement on previous years and, please note, the results from the schools in disadvantaged areas show the biggest improvement. Sadly not all pupils pass all exams of course, but all pupils of course have the right to appeal.Those whoseek to make political capital by distorting this very delicate situation are a disgrace.David McEwan Hill, Sandbank, Argyll.Read more: Letters: Is it right that the SQA should take a kicking "},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-dickens-mess-exam-grades","story":"SCOTTISH pupils have got their results.

This could be a golden opportunity to re-establish equal delivery costs for islanders –the Chancellor will take these calls seriously.“Almost every family in the Highlands and Islands, myself included, has a story about being overcharged for deliveries. In some cases delivery costs can be even higher than the product itself. Unreasonable charges are a barrier to growth and ease of living. This has to change.”He continued: “Delivery charge inequality affects communities represented by a wide range of parties, from Moray to Unst to Belfast.

They also provided essential trade routes to the protected waters of Scapa Flow.The medieval Viking names for farms and homesteads have long been known and studied in northern Scotland and the Isles. The new study investigated some of the names that have sea or boat connotations used for places that today are far inland in central Orkney.Names such as Greenay, meaning shallow waters, or Knarstonderived from the words for a transport vesseland a farm or homesteadwhere these vessels were moored. Warth, derived from Old Norse ‘ða’ , may also seem obscure as it is in a low-lying land-locked position today.However, there is evidence from Denmark that the same namewas used for a ‘vagttårne’in low-lying locations along water routes, such as the Roskilde fjord. Many such inland places are today located many miles from the open sea.Researchers used remote sensing geophysical methods to map a series of now infilled channels that extended north from the Loch of Harray to the lochs of Sabiston and Boardhouse towards the Earls seat of power in Birsay. The data was combined with information about the old landscape obtained from environmental records within sediment samples. These were cored from key sites throughout the area. The land is now dominated by agricultural activity and heavily modied by articial drainage networks constructed over the last three centuries making it dficult to see anything of the old waterways at the surface today. However, once the scientic data was analysed it was possible to model the pathways and link them to the nautically named locations.The results showed that a complete route from Harray, through the Loch of Banks and including a portage at Twatt over to the Loch of Boardhouse into the earldom estates in Birsay was easily achieved.The waterway network would have provided a shallow water routeway through which the Norse Vikings were able to haul both their boats and heavy goods, such as grain. Similar navigable waterways are known where in Scotland, for example, at Rubh an Dunain in Skye. This new work changes how we think about the transfer of goods and people in the west of mainland Orkney and perhaps enables historians and archaeologists to find more evidence of water transport in the Viking Age and Late Norse period in the Isles.Dr Alexandra Sanmark of the Institute for Northern Studies at the University of the Highlands and Islands said: “I am delighted with the outcome, as multiple pieces of written and landscape evidence suggested the existence of the waterway. The results will be used in our continued study of how the Norse used and organised the landscape of Orkney.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not having the energy they need makes nerves vulnerable to further damage and causes disability over time.Orkney is understood to have the highest rate of MS per capita of anywhere in the world.Researchers—  funded in part by the MS Society – have discovered a natural mechanism in the body that tackles this issue, which they are calling ARMD .The study also suggests that a common diabetes drug could help enhance this new-found natural mechanism – and prevent disability progression in the neurological condition. Although this naturalalone doesn’t provide enough energy to address demyelination in MS, further research in animal models now suggests that pioglitazone –  a drug currently used to treat diabetes – could be the answer. Dr Don Mahad, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Disability in MS is caused by a loss of nerve fibres following damage to the myelin that protects them. #Although our understanding of MS has vastly improved over the last two decades, new therapies still do not protect nerve fibres. Such protection is the Holy Grail in MS treatment — not only for the relapsing form of MS, which has ious options available, but for progressive forms too, where treatment continues to lag behind. “Our discovery shows that nerves respond to myelin damage by increasing the movement of mitochondriato the area of damage — a response we’re calling ‘ARMD’. #Remarkably, we were able to enhance ARMD and protect these vulnerable nerves using the readily available diabetes drug pioglitazone. This is an incredibly important discovery – one we believe could finally bridge the gap in MS treatment.” Over the last few decades there have been huge strides made in our understanding of MS, and there are now over a dozen effective treatments for people with relapsing MS — but these only address damage that is caused by the immune system. In order to truly stop MS and find treatments for everyone, a method of protecting nerves from further injury and repairing damaged myelin needs to be discovered.Last year, another MS Society funded study found that a dferent diabetes drug — the fasting mimetic drug metformin —was able tocells to a more youthful state, and encourage the re-growth of myelin. Led by Professor Robin Franklin, the study found metformin could reverse changes that happen to cells responsible for making myelin as they age, and restore their regenerative capacity. MS Society assistant director of research, Dr Emma Gray, said: “This represents another important stride towards our goal of stopping MS — and we believe that MS treatment could in the near future look completely dferent. #People with MS will be prescribed a combination of therapies that work on every aspect of the condition: stopping immune attacks and relapses, protecting nerves from damage, and regenerating lost myelin. It will mean no-one needs to worry about their MS getting worse.“Currently, there are no effective neuroprotective therapies available for MS, but Dr Mahad’s research demonstrates we are getting closer – and finding treatments for everyone with MS is now a very real prospect.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Care home visiting remains essential visiting indoors only with controlled visiting outside.·        We are advising people who are not in Aberdeen, not to travel there.·        Anyone already in Aberdeen visiting family or on holiday may stay, but they should follow all the guidance and take extra care when theyhome.·        The regulations which stipulate the restrictions on hospitality – and the associated guidance and advice – will be reviewed in seven days.·        We understand the impact these measures will have on iniduals and businesses.·        We would emphasise that where a business has brought staff off furlough, those staff can be re-furloughed, as part of the Jobs Retention Scheme.·        Our precautionary and careful judgement is we need to take decisive action now to try to contain this outbreak and prevent further harm later oncopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The SQA then checked and validated the information received. According to the council, moderations to the results, up or down, have been made by the SQA,necessary, to ensure consistency across schools and colleges and consistency with results from previous years.Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC education, leisure and housing committee said that all had stepped up to the challenges set before them during these unprecedented times.“Never before have the exams been cancelled, so it has been a steep learning curve for all involved and we must acknowledge the efforts of our teaching staff here in Orkney in making these dficult decisions — it is not easy when you know you are playing a part in determining the onward learning journey of students.#But teachers and lecturers are best placed to have a strong understanding of how their learners have performed and, based on their experience and the evidence available, what a learner would be expected to achieve in each course. I am confident all our staff will have made their best overall judgements based on their experience, knowledge and activity throughout the school year – fairness to students was vital in these truly exceptional circumstances, but teachers had to ensure a true reflection of a candidate’s ability.“I wish to offer my congratulations to all those who received results today, for their commitment to their studies, and thank their families, teachers and lecturers and the wider school and college community who supported them.“Today is a day for all pupils and adult learners across Orkney to celebrate their many achievements and successes, after many months and years of study. We are pleased that the overall pass rate across Orkney’s schools remains strong at  per cent – the same as last year’s pass rate.“When schools and college stafffrom the summer holiday detailed analysis of the results will take place, subject by subject, enabling the Council to evaluate trends, build on success and establish where any improvements may be needed.#We remain committed to assist in whatever way we can in helping all students move forward into positive destinations.”Kirkwall Grammar School head teacher, Don Hawkins, expressed his pride a the quality and amount of work carried out by staff to ensure the best possible outcomes for the young people of KGS.He said: “This can also be a time of incredible pressure for our young people and for some this will be a period of extreme anxiety, especiallytheir grades don#t match up to their expectations or hopes.“My message to all young people is that there is no one pathway.  No one’s journey will be exactly what they hoped for.  Congratulations on your success andthe results are not what you had wished, pick yourself up and try again.  As someone once said ‘there is no disgrace in being knocked down, there is only shame in not getting back up never quit!’.#Your parents and teachers will be there to provide you with the support and guidance you need to adapt the plan your pathway going forward.#Orkney schools and other local organisations are on hand to help pupils who are concerned about their exam results, or who just want some advice on what to do next.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/web-banner-1.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

Shielding was also paused for around , vulnerable people here last week.Read More Reopen all pubs or lose thousands of jobs and hundreds of bars: warning IT company Neueda creates  NI jobs amid £m investmentOwen Reidy, Assistant General Secretary for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions , said it was likely the job retention scheme here could be needed until at least .I think things are a lot more nuanced here in Northern Ireland. We would argue that where people can work from home they should.What we#re seeing now is a mix, and good employers are engaging with unions and giving workers choice especially over the summer months.He said it was crucial for employers to negotiate with their unions and draw up working from home policies.For us the new normal should be giving workers a range of options. Some medium companies may also be able to adjust their rentsthey have more people working from home.Where there are good industrial relations these things can happen.He welcomed that the Economy Minister Diane Dodds was promoting a working together document, which was drawn up with input from trade unions and employers earlier this year.It#s quite black and white about what has to happen which is good as there are lots of workers who are particularly anxious about ing to work and feeling vulnerable.On extending the job retention scheme beyond October for those who are shielding and can#t work from home, he said: I think it does need to be kept, and I think you#re seeing an argument in the developed world that these schemes will need to be kept for a number of months and possibly into  and kept under review.We need to avoid redundancies where possible, andwe can furlough people the connection with the employer and the workplace remains.Redundancy is incredibly damaging for those people and their families trying to maintain their living standards.It#s also a loss of revenue for the state coming through the tax system.A spokesperson for the Department for the Economy said the Executive#s recovery plan included the steps for ing to work.Working from home will be the new normal for many employees and businesses, they said. Others will already be back in their workplaces because of their business needs or personal circumstances. Some people may now be moving to a hybrid of working from home and the office. Employees and employers need to find arrangements that suit their needs in safe workplaces. These decisions will be inidual to businesses, workplaces and employees.The spokesperson added: The Minister for the Economy has visited businesses in Northern Ireland to see how this practical guide can be applied to workplaces, and has seen the impact that the collapse in footfall is having in our town and city centres. Large numbers of workers across Northern Ireland are still working from home, including around , civil servants and thousands of workers in the IT sector.While the Northern Ireland Civil Service yesterday said it had no up-to-date figures on the percentage of its staff who have ed to offices, in June it revealed that just over half were at home.In response to an Assembly Question, the Finance Minister Conor Murphy said that % of the NICS#s workforce of , were working from home. It#s understood that number has fluctuated since.Allstate, one of Northern Ireland#s biggest employers in the IT sector, has said it moved quickly to set up its , staff to work from home. And they said staff - who usually work from offices in Belfast, Strabane and Derry - would stay at home until the end of the year.The company said: As Allstate thinks about a phasedto the office the company will follow all government guidelines and the safety of our employees is our priority. Ulster Bank said that while branches had stayed open during lockdown, office-based staff in its headquarters at Donegall Square were working from home and would remain there into .Danske Bank said it was starting to bring staff back to its head office, also in Donegall Square in Belfast.Danske Bank has had a large number of staff working from its physical locations right throughout the crisis, including keeping all  of its branches and its contact centre fully operational. A phasedfor all head office staff in central Belfast is planned over the coming weeks.Novosco, an IT firm based in Catalyst Inc in Titanic Quarter, told BBC Radio Ulster that it#s now giving staff the option of coming in. Susan Hill told Radio Ulster that the decision followed a survey which found that around one third of its workers wanted back in the office.Meanwhile, business advisory firm PwC told the BBC that around  of over , staff were now back in its Belfast offices.

August   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFirst of all I would like to say a word to my brother Aidan who unfortunately cannot be with us today due to Coronavirus restrictions.Aidan, Gail and their five kids are watching us from Marshfield. Massachusetts.I would also like to mention Aine and Kevin’s daughter, Roisin, John’s granddaughter, in Vancouver where she is watching in the middle of the night.You may not be with us in person, but we know you are here, as does dad.Summing up our dad’s le in a few minutes is not an easy task.For a man who supposedly had only one single transferable speech, dad did a lot of dferent things in his le.He also made us laugh, dream, think, and sometimes look at him and scratch our heads in amazement .He also kept the Irish chocolate industry in healthy profits for many years. Yorkies, Crunchies, creme eggs, Double Deckers, Wispas, you name it, he loved them all.We often found it odd, how a man with the intelligence to win a Nobel Prize could seriously believe that Crunchies were less fattening because they are full of air.On Father’s day, a few weeks ago, as we couldn’t be with him, all his grandchildren posted him his favourite chocolate bars. I hear they had a feast in Owen Mor.If dad were here today in the fullness of his health, witnessing the current tensions in the world, he wouldn’t waste the opportunity to say a few words.He’d talk about our common humanity, the need to respect ersity and dference, to protect and deepen democracy, to value education, and to place nonviolence at the absolute centre.He might also stress the right to a living wage and a roof over your head, to decent healthcare and education.If he were here now, he might quote his friend, Congressman John Lewis, who sadly passed away a few weeks ago, appealing to the “goodness of every human being and never giving up”.Dad was a Derryman to his core, and those deep roots of neighbourhood and community served to nourish him through the dficult years.From the beginning, the European Union was like a homecoming to him, bringing together erse cultures in an interdependent relationship, allowing for unique identities while also holding a bigger picture of unied kinship.At this time of planetary fragility, more than ever, he would be urging that we move beyond our flag-based identities, and recognise the need to protect our common home.Central to dad’s work was his deep appreciation of human interdependency. We all need one another, we all have a role to play, and all our roles are of equal importance.In the last years of dad’s le, his physical and mental health became more visibly vulnerable.And yet in those recent years, more than ever, we as a family witnessed the absolute importance of dad’s core ethos, of building community based on respect and love.The kindness shown to him by the people of Derry and Donegal, who stopped to talk to him in the street every day, guided him to protect his independence, and received him with gentlenesshe was agitated, was a profound gt to all of us.We are eternally grateful to all those that helped over the years.In these last two years, when he’d lost his mobility and eyesight, he moved to Owen Mor nursing home.In this, his last home, and it was a home, all of us as a family were made welcome, and became part of a new community of families and carers.The deep attention and love shown to dad and to the many friends he made among carers, residents and their families, will remain a lesson to us for the rest of our lives.During the long weeks of lockdown when we as a family were unable to be with him, we knew that, despite the major dficulties of infection management and bereavement, the Care and Nursing staff in Unit One were doing their absolute best, to care deeply for him, and for all his fellow residents.We know that he continued to sing songs every day, to teach them all a wee bit of French, to tell his jokes, to demand more buns, and to question everyone daily about where they came from, their origins and their families.He remained deeply interested in every inidual, evenhe remembered little of it, until the end of his days.Dad was also a father, a husband and a man who loved and cared for his family at all times.Marrying Pat, our mother, was without a doubt dad’s greatest achievement and she enabled him to reach his full potential.Mum and dad met at a dance in Borderland in Donegal, the starting point for many a Derry family.Romance was followed by a wedding, and a December honeymoon in a freezing BB in Gardiner Street in Dublin.Thankfully for mum, the quality of the accommodation got better as the marriage went on.Our mum, who loved, supported and guided him throughout his tireless work for peace, and later in his frailty, was his greatest blessing.None of us remember him changing nappies, or indeed putting manydinners on the table.What we do remember are endless coffee cups and overflowing ashtrays, newspapers everywhere, and constant stream of callers night and day to our home in West End Park.But he was there for all of us throughout his le. There were times when we felt that he was absent, but he wasn’t, he was just with us from somewhere .Along with mum, he taught us all our values and gave us all our moral compass. And for that we will be forever in their debt.As a family we will remember the man who was rooted in his community, a man who was most comfortable sittng in front of the TV, with half a dozen Crunchie bars to keep him company, and his family around him. Or the odd time holding court around the corner in the Park Bar.A man who ordered the same dinner in the same restaurants in Strasbourg and Greencastle for  years.I’m sure he’s up there now ordering his creme brulee and that awful sweet wine he loved.A man who loved Derry at its best, be that promoting the Candystripes across the world or the many choirs that he brought from here to Europe to sing in Brussels and Strasbourg.A man who didn’t need to be invited twice to lt a mic himself, and give us a blast of the Town I love so well or Matt Hyland, and many, many, many, more besides.A man who truly believed in Derry and the talents of our people, and became our greatest Ambassador to the world.A man who loved Donegal and spent much of his downtime in Bunbeg and Greencastle Moville where he was able to switch off and relax  finally get that peace and quiet he deserved.The care dad received in the last years of his le allowed him to retain his dignity, iniduality and his magnicent strength of character, despite his overwhelming disabilities.It allowed him to overcome.If he were here, he would urge us to look at those young carers and the incredible and heroic daily work they do as a model for future leadership - their ethos of deep respect, a respect for everyone regardless of where they come from or stage of le.These are the foundation stones that are critical to all communities.The Reverend ML King might describe it as the politics of love.Dad would urge us to listen, so that in spite of it all we shall overcome.Thank you dad for a le well lived.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcab-c-ab--acc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcab-c-ab--acc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcab-c-ab--acc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcab-c-ab--acc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcab-c-ab--acc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandJohn Hume ‘made peace visible during darkest moments’John Hume made peace visible for others even in the darkest moments, his funeral has been told.VideoNorthern IrelandProtect the peace John Hume built, Derry priest urges communityA commitment to peace in Northern Ireland must be John Hume#s lasting legacy, the priest who will celebrate his Requiem Mass on Wednesday has said.GalleryNorthern Ireland PremiumA huge amount of sadness in the Derry air, but also palpable pride for city#s favourite sonThe town that John Hume loved so well, in song and in his heart, showed the feeling was mutual yesterday as people in his native Derry hailed their colossus of change amid calls for the city#s peace bridge to be renamed in his honour.VideoNorthern IrelandJohn Hume gave his le and his health for Ireland, funeral told as peacemaker laid to rest in DerryJohn Hume was a man who gave his le and his health for his country spurred on by compassion and desire to give dignity to everyone, the congregation at the funeral of the Nobel Laureate heard.Most ReadTwo more Co Down businesses close after staff test positive for Covid-Dad made us laugh, dream, think: John Hume Jr#s powerful farewell to fatherA special man: Tributes to TV presenter Brian Black after car plunge tragedySecurity alert at East Belfast GAA #attempt to intimidate# Farewell John, from the town you loved so well,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Just think of pop royalty like the Beckhams who gted their children the monikers Brooklyn, Cruz, Romeo and Harper.Sir Bob Geldof and his late we Paula were among the early trendsetters when it came to naming their daughters, settling upon Fi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie. When Paula went on to have a baby with Michael Hutchence, she kept to the family tradition, calling the little girl Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily.Not all celebrity offspring, however, enjoy being called something a little bit dferent. The late David Bowie named his son Zowie Bowie — full name Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones. At the age of , the youngster said he preferred to be called by his nickname Joey, later shortening it to Joe. Now a film director and screenwriter, he is known as Duncan Jones.He’s not the only one to opt for the ordinary — or at least to rue the day an unusual name seemed an inspired and fun choice.According to a new survey by Gigacalculator, Hunter and Aurora are among the top names parents regret calling their kids. The poll also reveals that thanks to Prime Minister Johnson and President Trump, parents have been totally put off calling their kids Boris or Donald. And mums and dads polled also said they would steer clear of the names Karen, Isis and Meghan for their little girls.So, what’s it like to go through le with a name that turns heads  While most Northern Ireland parents go down a more traditional path, we have tracked down some people with, well, famous names. Elvis Kirk: ‘Lots of people don’t believe I’m called it’Elvis Kirklives in Killyleagh with his we Paula. Elvis has three grown-up children, Tanya , Jonathanand Rebeccaand runs Elvis Kirk Contracts and KC Skip Hire and Recycling. He says he loves his name.“My mother was a big Elvis fan,” he says. “There was a big family of us, eight of us, and I was in the middle somewhere. They all have ordinary country names. There was Mervyn, Sidney, Philip, Alastair who passed away, me, Ronnie, Harold and Sandra.“There was a maternity hospital in Downpatrick called Hardy Greer and my mother was in there about to have me and the radio was on. Elvis had brought the song Teddy Bear out at the time and my mother said to the woman in the bed next to her thatshe had another boy she was going to call him Elvis. And that was how I got stuck with it. “I do like the name. Everyone always says what a lovely name it is but no-one ever calls their child it. At work I do a lot of phone calls andI ring a business and they ask me for my name sometimes you hear them laughing. A lot of them don’t believe that it’s your real name. But it’s quite good fun. We used to call our business Kirk Contracts in the early years and we later changed it to Elvis Kirk Contracts and I think that has been a great help. People see it on the lorries and look twice. It’s good fun.”While some people with such a name might dread being the butt of jokes in the classroom, Elvis says he never had any bother. “The teachers always liked my name. I suppose people thought it was a bit strange but I never got any hassle about it. People liked it more than anything.”And just like the rock’n’roll legend himself, Co Down’s own Elvis has made the headlines in his local newspaper a few times... though not for his singing.“I left school when I was  and have been working ever since, driving diggers and doing demolition, knocking big buildings down and driving big lorries — just rocking, knocking and rolling,” he quips. “We took the old council offices down in the town here about seven years ago and the local newspaper put ‘Elvis is rocking the building’ in the headline for a story on it. I hope to keep on rocking for another few years yet.“I thought some of my grandchildren might have taken my name,” he says. “But not so far. I don’t even know any other Elvis. I had heard of a man down in the country with the name Elvis, but I’m not surethat was his middle name. My first name is Elvis, it’s on my birth certicate, I was christened Elvis. “It’s never given me any problems opening bank accounts or anything. It definitely didn’t make them give me a bigger overdraft.“I wouldn’t change my name. If I came back again I would want to still be called Elvis. My name is part of who I am. “Like the real Elvis I can sing, but unlike the real Elvis I wouldn’t sing in front of anyone. I keep my singing for the shower or in the cab of a lorry. I sing away there.” He adds: “I would be a great Elvis fan, and am really proud to be named after him.”Mercedes Carr: ‘I wouldn’t ever change my name ... it’s part of who I am’Mother of two Mercedes Carr,lives in Londonderry with her partner Christopher and children Kianand Kora . She was named after her father’s dream car.“My mum and dad had seven children,” she says. “And I was the last of seven. My mum said to my dad that he could name the last child. So my daddy got to name me — as my mum named all the rest of the children — and he called me Mercedes. “Daddy was a big Mercedes fan and actually wanted one at the time but he wasn’t in a position to buy one, so he said he would name his daughter Mercedes instead. Dad eventually got his Mercedes, me, and also got a Mercedes car eventually which he had for several years. “It’s an unusual first and second name, but no one really noticed when I was younger, at primary school. But when I went to secondary school people noticed and thought it was a really cool name. No-one ever said it was terrible. When I was growing up and going to school, mum and dad imagined that someone would say something to me, but there was no negativity. Everyone loved it and thought I was lucky to have such an unusual name.“My name is strange, but I do like it. I don’t know anyone with the same name. Mind you, when you go into one of those novelty shops to buy a keyring or a mug with your name on it, I can never find my name there. I suppose a Mercedes car keyring is the only thing that would have my name on it.”When it came to her own son and daughter though, Mercedes decided to stay strictly middle of the road on the name front. “When I had my children I never thought about naming them something as unusual as my own name. I couldn’t do it to them. My fear would be that they would grow up, someone would say something to them about their name and then I would blame myself for giving them that name.”Mercedes, however, says that she is glad that her name has set her apart for le — and wouldn’t change it for the world.“People have trouble spelling my name at times, there are so many ‘e’s in it,” she says. “But it has never been shortened over the years to a nickname. The only person who did that was my best friend who calls me ‘Merc’. When I’m talking to people I don’t know or dealing with banks and things, people say ‘Are you sure that’s your first name ’ I say, ‘Yes I’m pretty sure’. Then I tell them my second name and that’s the showstopper. They think I am messing around with them. “If I could change my name, I wouldn’t. It’s part of who I am. I don’t think I would suit anything . You’ll never find another Mercedes Carr, I’m the only one.”Tyrone Power: ‘It’s not bad being named after a swashbuckling hero’Tyrone Poweris from Ballymena. He is married to Wilma and together they have a daughter Andrea , and son, also Tyrone . Tragically, their other daughter Rhonda died in a crash when she was just -years-old. The retired Gallaher’s factory worker says his mother was a huge fan of a certain Hollywood movie star.“My mother was a big fan of Tyrone Power,” he says. “My name has absolutely nothing to do with the county. “Tyrone Power was famous during the s and s. “He was around at the same time as Errol Flynn and was a swashbuckling, handsome movie star. I think my mum had a notion of him. Thousands and thousands of women attended his funeral. “I do like my name. People don’t recognise it as much now, but years ago people used to ask meI was the famous actor. Now they don’t seem to react as much any more or they think it is some connection with Co Tyrone. “Tyrone, as a first name, has got really popular in the likes of America, but years ago when I was a young man it was a very unusual name. It’s not too bad being named about a swashbuckling hero. Sometimes I wished I was him.”Tyrone says that there was more than one movie star in his street.“People might find this hard to believe, but there was another young fella in my street whose parents called him Errol Flynn. “We were stopped by the police when we were out one night and Errol was asked his name and I was asked my name and the policeman didn’t believe us. “He was going to take us to the barracks because he thought we were messing him around. “Errol’s dead now, but he used to live across the street from us. The neighbours in our street had a bit of a tradition of naming children after film stars. “There was myself, Tyrone Power, an Errol Flynn, a Robert Taylor and a Joan Collins all in the one row. “The postman made a comment in one of the local papers years ago that when he came into Inchkeith Road it was more like Hollywood Bouled with all the stars. I think my mum must have started a trend.“I do like my name. I am proud of it. I’m so proud of it I called my son Tyrone also. I wouldn’t change my name to anything less unusual. It’s given me a unique take on le. My we, when we met, didn’t even know who Tyrone Power was, so she was unfazed.”  Belfast   Most ReadTwo more Co Down businesses close after staff test positive for Covid-Dad made us laugh, dream, think: John Hume Jr#s powerful farewell to fatherA special man: Tributes to TV presenter Brian Black after car plunge tragedySecurity alert at East Belfast GAA #attempt to intimidate# Farewell John, from the town you loved so well,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

More contemporary figures were Claire Hanna, Nicola Mallon and Mark H Durkan.Even in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others Fr Paul FarrenFr Farren said the path towards peace was not easy for Mr Hume. The priest spoke of his compassion, referring to how he comforted families bereaved in the  Greysteel massacre.In a time in our world when often small mindedness and self-focus seems to be the driver, John never put anybody or any specic group first. He put everybody first, he added.He didn#t focus on dference and ision. He focused on unity and peace and giving that dignity to every person.

It was compassion - a compassion that bubbled over in the cemetery in Greysteel that drove John on the final and often lonely and always dficult road to peace.Fr Farren said this desire to create peace came at a heavy cost.He added: Even in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others. His vision revealed what could be and with time and determination and single-mindedness and stubbornness he convinced others that peace could be a reality. He never lost faith in peace and he never lost faith in his ability to convince others that peace was the only way.

Mo became tearful as she read her sibling#s tribute to their father.You made us realise a border is just a line on a map. It#s in our hearts and minds where we need to bridge the gap, she said.Thorough over  years of violence, hurt and unrelenting stress, those underlying conditions you never stopped trying to address. I don#t think I ever said aloud how you made us all so incredibly proud. All you ever wanted was to make the world a better place.A statement from the Vatican said: His Holiness Pope Francis was saddened to learn of the death of John Hume, and sends the assurance of his prayers to his family and to all who mourn his loss.A message from the Dalai Lama praised Mr Hume#s deep conviction in the power of dialogue and negotiations.As his remains were taken from St Eugene#s Cathedral, Mr Hume#s long time friend and fellow son of Derry, Phil Coulter, performed a poignant rendition of The Town I Loved So Well on the piano, accompanied on the Irish fiddle by composer, Frank Gallagher.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNorthern IrelandDad made us laugh, dream, think: John Hume Jr#s powerful farewell to fatherFirst of all I would like to say a word to my brother Aidan who unfortunately cannot be with us today due to Coronavirus restrictions.VideoNorthern Ireland PremiumPandemic robs Derry of farewell befitting global statesman and its favourite son John HumeIn normal times the streets of Derry would have been thronged with heavyweight world leaders, superstars from the entertainment industry and thousands of ordinary people wanting to pay homage to the extraordinary John Hume.

But not the Nash family.Our family always voted for John, even in those early days, says Kate.Mummy would almost come into the booth with you at elections to make sure you voted for John, laughs Linda.Up in Creggan, he was always therea family was having trouble with the army or anything like that.All he seemed to want to do was help people. And it was genuine concern. He wanted a better world for us, said Kate.Hume#s views on equality and dialogue didn#t always sit well with his political opponents and commentators. But Kate says this was not the case locally.Ordinary people always respected John Hume, and they knew he had their best interests at heart. He was an honest man.Other political forces around at the time wouldn#t have appreciated that.He was a powerful man and one of the best to come out of this country. He did so much. He was the peacemaker.A non-violent man. I#m sure there were times he must have been afraid. He went right up to the British soldiers and remonstrated with them. They could have knocked him clean out - or worse. They didn#t care.I was sad to miss it, but I haven#t been well, and I respected what Pat Hume said.I have my candle lighting for him all day.We were lucky to have him. He did so much for this town.And Hume was one of the founding members of the credit union.I joined it about  years ago, and that is how I have lived my le, says Kate.Anything I have needed, that#s where I would have got the money. You could afford to go there and get a loan. It was a leline for lots of people.John Hume was a very special human being. He was non-sectarian, and he never changed. He treated everybody the same.And that#s the way you would like the whole world to be.Gerry Murray was taught history by Hume at St Columb#s College  years ago. They later became friends through the SDLP.Mr Murray went on to study history at Trinity College Dublin and often travelled with Hume to college debates.He was the world#s worst driver. He could sit there for hours, saying nothing, but his mind was churning around.He would suddenly ask a question like, #Who do you think was the best American president #, says Mr Murray. John thought it was Kennedy, he adds.I used to go out campaigning with him in , and he was adored. The people of Derry respected him greatly. There was universality about him. He could talk with anyone.If things weren#t going well for him politically, he could rely on Derry people for support.I was with him one day, and we walked into Da Vinci#s bar, and this boy turned to him and said: #Don#t let the bastards get on top of you John, just keep going#.And as it transpired the man who said that was a republican but he wanted John to succeed. They admired him.That said, some of the people now saying he was a great peacemaker tried to burn his house down. That is what he and his family had to put up with.In a historical context, he was a major figure. Unlike O#Connell and Parnell, he achieved what he set out to achieve.I watched the funeral, and it was very strange not to be there.Seeing Pat and the children, who I would have known growing up, I was half expecting to see John pop into view.He almost seemed to be there without being there. You#d half expect him to turn around and say, #Well, what about ye #It was both heartbreaking and very uplting watching the funeral.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMourners lined the streets as John Hume#s coffin leaves St Eugene#s Cathedral.

Credit: Google FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp Millisle Road, Donaghadee. Credit: GoogleMichael Kenwood, Local Democracy ReporterAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAn application to demolish a Co Down parochial house to make way for a children’s nursery has been refused on conservation grounds.Ards North Down councillors at this week’s council planning committee followed planning officer recommendations and refused an application by Saba Investments to knock down the parochial house at Millisle Road, Donaghadee.The site is within the southern boundary of the Donaghadee conservation zone. The house, a two storey villa, has been vacant for a long period, and despite having boarded up windows and a dilapidated wooden balcony, was described in the council case report as appearing to be “structurally sound.”The principal architect involved in the application, Noel Orr, told councillors the nursery plan was not economically feasibleit involved regenerating the building, and added there was support in around Donaghadee to replace the building.Planning officer Gail Kerr said the council was not against a nursery in the area, and said this could be acceptable with a regeneration scheme.She added: “Just because there may be community support for demolition it doesn’t make it acceptable under policy terms.“A good example is the old Town Hall in Donaghadee. That sat for years as a ruin of a building and would not have been seen as an asset visually to the area but it was an important addition to that conservation area.“No matter how long that sat there, we would not have accepted any plan for demolition of that building. A scheme came forward, and there has been a very successful regeneration.“Financial arguments alone are not enough to justy demolition. It is widely accepted that buildings within conservation areas do impose additional restrictions and yes, sometimes financial burdens on their owners. This has to be balanced against the wider value of the building in terms of the contribution to the historical, architectural and cultural heritage of the place it resides.”The house was built between  and , for William Henry Connolly, a mineral water manufacturer, and was designed by Belfast architect William John Fennell, who also designed the Cooke Centenary Presbyterian Church on Ormeau Road. It was sold to the local Catholic parish in the s.Alliance councillor Gavin Walker proposed the committee support the officer’s recommendation and refuse the demolition plan. He said: “I think the argument can be made very strongly for the relevance of this building to Donaghadee.“We have spent a lot of time and a substantial amount of money in the last few years to create a real feeling of historic sense and place in Donaghadee, of which this building is a part.“I appreciate it’s been empty for a long time and I’m sure it’s a dficult building for a developer to deal with. But that’s just the way things are.”Eleven councillors voted in favour of the refusal, with two supporting the application.Belfast Most ReadTwo more Co Down businesses close after staff test positive for Covid-Dad made us laugh, dream, think: John Hume Jr#s powerful farewell to fatherA special man: Tributes to TV presenter Brian Black after car plunge tragedySecurity alert at East Belfast GAA #attempt to intimidate# Farewell John, from the town you loved so well,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"security alert at east belfast gaa attempt to intimidate","story":"Police at the scene of a security alert at East Belfast GAA at Henry Jones# Playing Fields in the Castlereagh Hills on August th  Kevin Scott   Belfast  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPolice at the scene of a security alert at East Belfast GAA at Henry Jones# Playing Fields in the Castlereagh Hills on August th  August   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA security alert at the training ground of East Belfast GAA has been deemed a hoax. The DUP#s East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson said the alert was a clear attempt to intimidate the recently formed GAA club. East Belfast MLA Andy Allen said the alert was totally abhorrent behaviour and not representative of the area. Police were at the scene from Wednesday evening after reports multiple explosives had been planted. Nothing untoward was found after a search and police are treating the incident as a sectarian hate crime. A forensic examination has taken place on a nearby telephone box.Henry Jones# Playing Fields in the Castlereagh Hills was cordoned off as police investigated. The playing fields are owned and operated by Belfast City Council and used by a wide-range of dferent groups.In a statement East Belfast GAA said their training session on Wednesday evening had been disrupted after police received a call that a package had been left at their training ground.On the advice of police the training session was abandoned.The club expresses its thanks to both the PSNI and to our playing members, who behaved impeccably during the situation, the club statement read.The creation and maintenance of a safe environment for sport to be played by all and the safety of our members whilst playing remains a priority for us all. The club intends to continue to work with the police, the community in east Belfast, and the public at large, whose support we have enjoyed on a daily basis, to ensure the continued safety and enjoyment of our members and patrons.

Thankfully nothing was found and the alert has now ended., he said.His comments were echoed by UUP MLA Mr Allen.Whilst this was a hoax, the fear that this behaviour creates will be present amongst those who were training at the pitches last night, he said.“These pitches are widely used by all members of the community and those seeking to intimidate anyone playing sports there needs to wise up.” Sinn Fein#s North Belfast MP John Finucane called the threat despicable. “The GAA is inclusive and it welcomes people from all backgrounds and none, he said. “The sporting fraternity must stand together against this attack on the growth of the GAA and on a society which is moving forward. It’s unacceptable.” Alliance Councillor Eric Hanvey said those behind the security alert were an absolute disgrace and did not represent east Belfast.“East Belfast GAA has received plaudits from right across the community, and rightly so, in their attempt to help build a better future in east Belfast by bringing people together via sport, so they can live, work and play together in peace, he said.“Those behind security alerts such as these are clearly not interested in something so positive but rather only ision and destruction. They are unwanted in east Belfast or anywhere , and I urge anyone with information on them to contact police with it immediately.”SDLP councillor Seamas De Faoite said the alert was an appalling attempt to intimidate East Belfast GAA.“No team should feel threatened by those who seek to deny that the GAA can be just as much a part of the character and spirit of East Belfast as any other sport, he said. East Belfast GAA formed earlier this year. It received a huge interest from people right across the community to take part.The club made its debut in the Down All-County Football League last month. It has yet to find a ground in east Belfast for home matches.Its motto is together which features on its crest in Irish, Ulster Scot and English.Police said enquiries into the incident are ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact police at Strandtown on  quoting reference number    .

As Mr Hume#s remains were carried from St Eugene#s Cathedral following Requiem Mass on Wednesday, Mr Coulter#s musical version of the song could be heard drting from inside.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Coulter said: The Town I Loved So Well was the song he loved so well and we have done a duet on that on many#s an occasion in some weird and wonderful places.It was very poignant for me to play it for John today. It became John#s anthem and certainly any time we were in company and I was asked to play the piano, I could be sure that within seconds Hume would be at my shoulder saying #do the Town#.Mr Coulter acknowledged his friend#s singing capabilities, which he said were like every one  in Derry.He added: John could sing and like everybody in Derry, he believed God gave him the right to sing.

That was already happening, Ms Alfahl said.I#m not sure, but from what I#ve seen before, I don#t think the government can support them.They need outside help now. Without it they cannot survive a huge explosion costing millions of dollars.Philip Ingram, a former military intelligence officer and explosives expert from Northern Ireland, said he believed the blast was a tragic accident with a series of circumstances that have come together to cause a massive explosion. The trouble is that a lot of countries in the Middle East are not well known for applying regulations , he added.The facility in Beirut is unlikely to be a specialist one, which in itself can lead to very dangerous circumstances.The crazy thing is, this was an official facility. The government had seized these goods from a ship. Over time it became a disaster waiting to happen. To say the government is weak and unstable is an understatement. It has real dficulty managing what#s going on in the country and this will probably not have even been on its radar.The international community promised to send Lebanon aid as it struggles to recover.French president Emmanuel Macron is due to visit the country, a former protectorate of France, today. His government has already dispatched two planes full of specialists, rescue workers and supplies to Beirut.The European Union has activated its civil protection system to round up emergency workers and equipment.The EU commission said the plan was to send more than  firefighters with vehicles, snfer dogs and specialist equipment to Lebanon. The Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Poland and the Netherlands have signed up to the relief effort, with other nations expected to follow suit.The EU#s satellite mapping system will also be used to help the local authorities establish the extent of damage. Cyprus, where Tuesday#s blast was felt, is sending in emergency personnel and snfer dogs. Help is also coming from closer to home. Iraq is sending six trucks of medical supplies and an emergency medical team and Egypt and Jordan are supplying field hospitals.Israeli prime minister said his country was ready to help the Lebanese even though the two nations are technically at war.The World Health Organisation is sending medical supplies to cover up to , trauma interventions and up to , surgical interventions following a request from local health chiefs.Belfast Related ContentVideoWorldPeople lost all that they had in seconds: Lebanese QUB student horried by Beirut devastationA pharmacy student in Belfast who grew up in Beirut and a Northern Irish explosives expert have spoken of their shock at the devastating blast in the Lebanese capital.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKBeirut blast brings reminder of Grenfell suffering as Britons are urged to helpA British-Lebanese fundraiser has said the explosion in Beirut evoked memories of the Grenfell Tower fire as he urged Britons to aid those affected.Most ReadTwo more Co Down businesses close after staff test positive for Covid-Dad made us laugh, dream, think: John Hume Jr#s powerful farewell to fatherA special man: Tributes to TV presenter Brian Black after car plunge tragedySecurity alert at East Belfast GAA #attempt to intimidate# Farewell John, from the town you loved so well,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At his father’s funeral yesterday, a message was read out on behalf of Aidan Hume in which he said the university campaign served as a catalyst for his father’s career in politics. In , the Lockwood report recommended that Northern Irelands second university be sited in Coleraine rather than Derry. It was viewed as a controversial decision at the time and highly contested in the city. That same year a cross-community campaign was led by John Hume, the unionist mayor Albert Anderson and Eddie McAteer, leader of the Nationalist Party. googletag.cmd.push At yesterday’s funeral a message was delivered by Hume’s daughter, Mo, on behalf of her brother Aidan who couldn’t travel from the United States due to the coronavirus pandemic. In it, Aidan said that using a moral compass as his only tether his father’s ‘perseverance and sheer will’ brought ‘hope and history’ together. “It began with the corrupt siting of the university, driven by a total lack of respect for ersity,’ he added. The university campaign acted as a prelude to the civil rights movement and was part of a building of frustrations felt by Derry people. Ultimately the protest had no impact on the final decision but it may have saved Magee campus, which had been earmarked for closure. googletag.cmd.push Eamonn McCann, civil rights veteran and former neighbour of Hume, believes it was the university campaign that set the tone for the former SDLP leader’s style of politics in the decades to come. At a Guildhall Square rally ‘jammed with people’ a youthful John Hume spoke not of ‘unionist discrimination’ but of the need for ‘togetherness’ to bring about reform. “There really you have the microcosm of his politics and strategy for the rest of his le, it was all there.” In  a Peace and Conflict Studies course was formed at the Magee campus in Derry, an internationally renowned programme offered by leading academics from the International Conflict Research Institute . In recognition of Hume’s peace-building efforts, Ulster University announced funding for the John Hume and Thomas P. ONeill Chair in Peace, to be established at the Magee campus. Set up in honour of both politicians, the Chair is a full-time academic position in peace and conflict resolution studies which helps to train the next generation of peacemakers from around the world. Presidents and leaders from around the world, including Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama, spoke to audiences at the campus. However, there was widespread concern in Derry when a decision was made to relocate the course to Belfast a number of years ago. ‘JOHN’S VISION’ Current SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that throughout his le, John Hume stood up for Derry and all its people. “He understood the transformative impact of education and knew all too well the structural inequalities forced upon the people of this city,” he said. “John campaigned for university provision in Derry that could deliver the skills and opportunities our people need to grow and prosper, even against the backdrop of a campaign of violence that plagued the lives of those in the city. “Delivering on John’s vision for Derry is a priority for me and for the SDLP. I am committed to ensuring that everyone in this city has the opportunity to make a live for themselves here. “Johns lasting legacy should be that we never allow our young people to be raised for export. Derry needs a full-scale university, nothing  will meet the needs of our people.” Meanwhile, the Derry University Groupwhich has been lobbying for an independent university in the city described John Hume as one of the greatest educators and thinkers the city has known since Colmcille. GarbhaacutenDowney of the DUG said: “He taught us of the importance of a university as a centre of learning, industry, science and arts, heritage, philosophy and discourse as the focal point for community engagement, and the lead agent for positive change and self-empowerment “He worked throughout his career to establish a university here to serve as the bedrock for the new, peaceful society of equals, which he had envisaged for Derry from his earliest days as a social champion. “The campaign to build a university, begun by John Hume sixty years ago, is still unfinished. It has been described as the last remaining civil rights issue. “There could be no more fitting legacy to John Hume than for his home city to finish this job now.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Louise Campbells song Everywhere was written in March just before lockdown and recorded in her home studio in the Waterside. The single was been picked up by both Christian radio station, UCB Ireland, and Derrys Drive . And it has now been accepted to the Indie Folk Acoustic section of the UK Christian Chart  A Step Fwd, which unlike traditional charts works on an online voting system. To even have it accepted was amazing, said Louise. There are some really big established names in my category. So evenit doesnt place its great just to have that recognition. googletag.cmd.push Louise is also part of Irish music collective Wired Worship which has  members from across the North West from dferent Christian backgrounds. Although she has been involved in music from a young age, Louise had lost confidence in her singing and songwriting. But after starting to write Christian music just over a year ago, she feels she has found her voice again. I write Christian music that everyone can listen to, explained Louise. A lot of my songs are about struggling with mental health and finding acceptance and being OK with who you are. People who arent religious in any way have told me that my songs have spoken to them. googletag.cmd.push Louise is a member of All Saints Clooney, Church of Ireland church on the Limavady Road and she had recently explored the possibility of becoming an ordained minister. She was disappointed not to get through the selection process, but instead of feeling it was a rejection she now sees it as a sign that music is the right path for her. I have sung from when I was a child and dreamed of being a singer for my whole le, she said. But I had lost my confidence and I hadnt written in years. Once I started writing about my own experiences I just couldnt stop. My songs are about relatable, real experiences as a broken person who doesnt have it all together all the time. Louise is hoping to release her debut album Stumble Into Grace at the end of the year and she is funding its production by selling handcrafted items online. She has set up a crafting station in a cabin in her back garden from which she creates hand made art. I have been painting, sewing and woodburning, she said. I love to take old junk and make something beautul. Pre-lockdown, Louise was very busy with her two kids and volunteer work but after being forced to shield due to severe asthma she suddenly found herself with lots of spare time. I loved it, she said. Ive never had this amount of time to do the stuff I want to want to do, rather than the stuff I have to do. So a lot of good has come out of it, although Id like it to be under better circumstances. Louise has set up a Facebook page dedicated to her music and art and a  member strong Facebook prayer group. Im an outgoing person but Im also a complete introvert, said Louise. But now I feel like Ive got all these people behind me shoving me off the bus. Ive come to see that my own fears and insecurities arent a good enough reason not to do what Im being called to do. You can find out more about Louise at her Facebook Page Lousie Campbell-Stumbling into Grace. Louises song Everywhere is on Wired Worships album Hear which is available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon music.

It’s unlikely Ballyronan had ever seen anything like it. Tickets for the event cost pound. and, even allowing for inflation, represented real value for the sheer quality of the acts on show. Rory Gallagher was the headline act in the festival’s second year, and would ultimately prove to be the last, as it never ed to the Loughshore. While shortlived, the festival boasted a stellar line up, with a host of rock talent making their way to the south Derry village. googletag.cmd.push The hugely talented Pat McManus remembers the gig well. Among them was Pat McManus, lead guitarist and fiddle player in Mama’s Boys, who were second on the bill behind Gallagher on that late July evening  years ago. “We were heading off on a European tour and it was seen as a good warm-up gig for us to do as well. It was a good festival gig to get us into tip-top shape,” he told the County Derry Post. “We had an album out - Growing Up the Hard Way – and we would have been there to promote it. They must have thought they’d have the two Irish bands to headline – Rory and ourselves. googletag.cmd.push “Plus, to be on the same bill as Rory Gallagher was fantastic, we always jumped at the chance to share the stage with Rory. “He was one of my heroes growing up, and still is. He was marvellous. From that point of view, it was great. “We’d shared the stage a couple of times with Rory in Germany and ious places like that, but this was the first time on home soil, which we were delighted about.”  While McManus, a native of Derrylin in County Fermanagh, was unfamiliar with Ballyronan, Mama’s Boys did have a link to the maiden festival of . “Magnum was the headline act the year before and Mark Stanway, their keyboard player, has been in my solo band quite a few times,” he said. “This kind of festival wasn’t too popular in Ireland, but in Germany and other places we toured, you would get lots of little villages putting on festivals. “The attendance could be anywhere from , to , people, it just depends. It was a brave thing to do. It wasn’t going to be Dalymount or Macroom that Rory had done in the past. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play. “Rory was an international rock star, so to see him on your own soil, so close to Lough Neagh was an incredible thing. You wouldn’t have seen much of Rory playing that kind of festival.” While the presence of the Ballyshannon-born Gallagher was undoubtedly the festival’s main draw, a host of other stars were strewn throughout the supporting acts. Don Airey of Deep Purple shared the stage with Mamas Boys in . Deep Purple’s Don Airey, who also played with Whitesnake, Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne, guested with Mama’s Boys, themselves an internationally supported band. Magnum’s Mark Stanley was also involved with the legendary Phil Lynott’s Grand Slam, while there was also a surprise appearance from one of Northern Ireland’s finest rock musicians. “The legendary Vivian Campbell, who now plays with Def Leppard, made a guest appearance with his old band, Sweet Savage, so that added more excitement on the day,” said McManus. “It was a wonderful afternoon’s music. People were rather spoiled. His pedigree as a musician from Northern Ireland was second to none. Everybody was very excited to see Vivian there.” The eclectic nature of the festival’s line up saw rock fans from across the country converging on the shores of Lough Neagh. Larne native Gerry McNally, current sub-editor of the Folk and Tumble website, had travelled down from the east coast for Rory’s gig, having also been in attendance the previous year. “I can remember crossing a couple of fields and it was right beside the Lough,” he said. “It was a beautul venue too, right on the shores of Lough Neagh and both years they had fireworks at the end of each night. The line ups were good both years too. “You were luckysomeone came to the Ulster Hall or the King’s Hall. Gigs would have been quite rare back then, you were mostly going to Dublin for them. Gerry McNallys ticket stub for the pound. gig. “I was only getting into Rory’s music, but I’d never seen or heard anything like it. He was still in good health back then and was just a ball of energy. “Sadly, that was the one and only time I saw him. Looking back, I wish I was as familiar with his music then as I am now. I would have appreciated it a lot more. “At the time, I’d never seen anything like it. I was living in the moment, taking it in and just being awestruck. His playing was amazing. “The only other band I really remember were Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts. They didn’t take themselves too seriously, but they were a good, fun band.” Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts may not have been Gerry’s go-to, but for young fan Darren Seaton, they were the main draw. “Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts was the other band I was specically there for,” said the Belfast native, who was  at the time. “You’d always see them listed in Kerrang, they were really good, but we were there all day. You got dropped off in the morning and you get picked up afterwards. Young rock fan Darren Seaton made the trip from Belfast for a glimpse at Dumpys Rusty Nuts. “Our trip was run by Makin’ Tracks in Belfast, they used to be the main record store. You would have got your gig tickets and bus tickets and then met at Glengall Street for the bus. “The day we were there, there was also a band from New Zealand that nobody had ever heard of. I’ve no idea how they got on the bill, but they were touring round Europe. “They had a video camera with them and were basically filming us all telling them to f**k off. “Rory, obviously, was legendary. I didn’t really know a lot about him, because being , I was more into Bon Jovi and stuff at the time,” he said. “I hadn’t realised the epicness of what was in front of me and the fact I wouldn’t get to see him live again.” Despite the profanity towards the unwitting visitors from the southern hemisphere, Darren and his friends managed to make their way to the backstage area. “There was a band playing called DARE, whose frontman, Darren Wharton, played keyboard with Thin Lizzy,” he said. Darren Wharton, formerly of Thin Lizzy, fronted DARE at the Rock at the Lough festival. “We were talking to their merch guy, who had a table behind a wire fence. He was on one side in the ‘backstage’ area and we were on the other, passing money through the fence for t-shirts. “He gave us his pass and told us to go into the dining hall, so me and a couple of mates went down and had dinner with the drummer and the bass player there!” Musicians coming to play in Northern Ireland had become a rare breed throughout the Troubles, with many acts choosing to avoid coming to Belfast in particular. Despite its idyllic setting on the Loughshore, the Ballyronan festival was not immune to the threat of violence. “We got down the road to Ballyronan to be told we couldn’t get in yet, because there was a bomb scare and a Chinook flying overhead,” recalled Darren. “It was a hoax, but we were sitting on the bus for about two hours outside Ballyronan until they cleared it and we were all allowed in.” News of the bomb scare also filtered through to the bands, all of whom had shown a steely determination to perform. “I remember something about that, but it obviously was a prank, because no one passed any remarks,” said Pat McManus. “And evenit was, we were going to go ahead and play anyway because people had paid in there and wanted to see the bands. “They [the police] were probably wondering what the hell was going on with all the people gathering – it might have been that more than anything . “We were determined, come hell or high water, we were going to get on that stage and play and the rest of the artists that day felt the same.” Local rock star Vivian Campbell made a surprise appearance at the festival. Despite a hugely ambitious line-up, the festival only lasted for two years. Although a beautul venue, a lack of marketing and issues with accessibility undermined its success. “I’d say there was somewhere in the region of , people there,” said Pat McManus. “People didn’t know about it either and others were a bit sceptical, but from looking out from where I was on the stage, that’s the amount I would have guessed. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play.” One of the fortunate, Darren Seaton, sums it up well. “It’s strange that a random place like Ballyronan had these two big festivals two years in a row. It was a great day out.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s unlikely Ballyronan had ever seen anything like it. Tickets for the event cost pound. and, even allowing for inflation, represented real value for the sheer quality of the acts on show. Rory Gallagher was the headline act in the festival’s second year, and would ultimately prove to be the last, as it never ed to the Loughshore. While shortlived, the festival boasted a stellar line up, with a host of rock talent making their way to the south Derry village. googletag.cmd.push The hugely talented Pat McManus remembers the gig well. Among them was Pat McManus, lead guitarist and fiddle player in Mama’s Boys, who were second on the bill behind Gallagher on that late July evening  years ago. “We were heading off on a European tour and it was seen as a good warm-up gig for us to do as well. It was a good festival gig to get us into tip-top shape,” he told the County Derry Post. “We had an album out - Growing Up the Hard Way – and we would have been there to promote it. They must have thought they’d have the two Irish bands to headline – Rory and ourselves. googletag.cmd.push “Plus, to be on the same bill as Rory Gallagher was fantastic, we always jumped at the chance to share the stage with Rory. “He was one of my heroes growing up, and still is. He was marvellous. From that point of view, it was great. “We’d shared the stage a couple of times with Rory in Germany and ious places like that, but this was the first time on home soil, which we were delighted about.”  While McManus, a native of Derrylin in County Fermanagh, was unfamiliar with Ballyronan, Mama’s Boys did have a link to the maiden festival of . “Magnum was the headline act the year before and Mark Stanway, their keyboard player, has been in my solo band quite a few times,” he said. “This kind of festival wasn’t too popular in Ireland, but in Germany and other places we toured, you would get lots of little villages putting on festivals. “The attendance could be anywhere from , to , people, it just depends. It was a brave thing to do. It wasn’t going to be Dalymount or Macroom that Rory had done in the past. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play. “Rory was an international rock star, so to see him on your own soil, so close to Lough Neagh was an incredible thing. You wouldn’t have seen much of Rory playing that kind of festival.” While the presence of the Ballyshannon-born Gallagher was undoubtedly the festival’s main draw, a host of other stars were strewn throughout the supporting acts. Don Airey of Deep Purple shared the stage with Mamas Boys in . Deep Purple’s Don Airey, who also played with Whitesnake, Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne, guested with Mama’s Boys, themselves an internationally supported band. Magnum’s Mark Stanley was also involved with the legendary Phil Lynott’s Grand Slam, while there was also a surprise appearance from one of Northern Ireland’s finest rock musicians. “The legendary Vivian Campbell, who now plays with Def Leppard, made a guest appearance with his old band, Sweet Savage, so that added more excitement on the day,” said McManus. “It was a wonderful afternoon’s music. People were rather spoiled. His pedigree as a musician from Northern Ireland was second to none. Everybody was very excited to see Vivian there.” The eclectic nature of the festival’s line up saw rock fans from across the country converging on the shores of Lough Neagh. Larne native Gerry McNally, current sub-editor of the Folk and Tumble website, had travelled down from the east coast for Rory’s gig, having also been in attendance the previous year. “I can remember crossing a couple of fields and it was right beside the Lough,” he said. “It was a beautul venue too, right on the shores of Lough Neagh and both years they had fireworks at the end of each night. The line ups were good both years too. “You were luckysomeone came to the Ulster Hall or the King’s Hall. Gigs would have been quite rare back then, you were mostly going to Dublin for them. Gerry McNallys ticket stub for the pound. gig. “I was only getting into Rory’s music, but I’d never seen or heard anything like it. He was still in good health back then and was just a ball of energy. “Sadly, that was the one and only time I saw him. Looking back, I wish I was as familiar with his music then as I am now. I would have appreciated it a lot more. “At the time, I’d never seen anything like it. I was living in the moment, taking it in and just being awestruck. His playing was amazing. “The only other band I really remember were Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts. They didn’t take themselves too seriously, but they were a good, fun band.” Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts may not have been Gerry’s go-to, but for young fan Darren Seaton, they were the main draw. “Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts was the other band I was specically there for,” said the Belfast native, who was  at the time. “You’d always see them listed in Kerrang, they were really good, but we were there all day. You got dropped off in the morning and you get picked up afterwards. Young rock fan Darren Seaton made the trip from Belfast for a glimpse at Dumpys Rusty Nuts. “Our trip was run by Makin’ Tracks in Belfast, they used to be the main record store. You would have got your gig tickets and bus tickets and then met at Glengall Street for the bus. “The day we were there, there was also a band from New Zealand that nobody had ever heard of. I’ve no idea how they got on the bill, but they were touring round Europe. “They had a video camera with them and were basically filming us all telling them to f**k off. “Rory, obviously, was legendary. I didn’t really know a lot about him, because being , I was more into Bon Jovi and stuff at the time,” he said. “I hadn’t realised the epicness of what was in front of me and the fact I wouldn’t get to see him live again.” Despite the profanity towards the unwitting visitors from the southern hemisphere, Darren and his friends managed to make their way to the backstage area. “There was a band playing called DARE, whose frontman, Darren Wharton, played keyboard with Thin Lizzy,” he said. Darren Wharton, formerly of Thin Lizzy, fronted DARE at the Rock at the Lough festival. “We were talking to their merch guy, who had a table behind a wire fence. He was on one side in the ‘backstage’ area and we were on the other, passing money through the fence for t-shirts. “He gave us his pass and told us to go into the dining hall, so me and a couple of mates went down and had dinner with the drummer and the bass player there!” Musicians coming to play in Northern Ireland had become a rare breed throughout the Troubles, with many acts choosing to avoid coming to Belfast in particular. Despite its idyllic setting on the Loughshore, the Ballyronan festival was not immune to the threat of violence. “We got down the road to Ballyronan to be told we couldn’t get in yet, because there was a bomb scare and a Chinook flying overhead,” recalled Darren. “It was a hoax, but we were sitting on the bus for about two hours outside Ballyronan until they cleared it and we were all allowed in.” News of the bomb scare also filtered through to the bands, all of whom had shown a steely determination to perform. “I remember something about that, but it obviously was a prank, because no one passed any remarks,” said Pat McManus. “And evenit was, we were going to go ahead and play anyway because people had paid in there and wanted to see the bands. “They [the police] were probably wondering what the hell was going on with all the people gathering – it might have been that more than anything . “We were determined, come hell or high water, we were going to get on that stage and play and the rest of the artists that day felt the same.” Local rock star Vivian Campbell made a surprise appearance at the festival. Despite a hugely ambitious line-up, the festival only lasted for two years. Although a beautul venue, a lack of marketing and issues with accessibility undermined its success. “I’d say there was somewhere in the region of , people there,” said Pat McManus. “People didn’t know about it either and others were a bit sceptical, but from looking out from where I was on the stage, that’s the amount I would have guessed. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play.” One of the fortunate, Darren Seaton, sums it up well. “It’s strange that a random place like Ballyronan had these two big festivals two years in a row. It was a great day out.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thats all they needed. Twelve months after surrendering the league title on the final day, Limavady were untouchable at the top of the table. A - victory at Ards saw Graeme Eastwoods side with one hand and the four fingers of the other on the trophy. With  wins from as many games, as well as  bonus points earned, Limavady accumulated  points out of a possible . The clubs seconds were second in the league and had a Forster Plate semi-final to look forward to. The first team had five of their six remaining league games at home, where they were unbeaten during Eastwoods tenure. Just shy of their meeting with second placed Ballymoney, Covid- dragged the sporting landscape to a halt and with the finish line in sight, their season of effort was gone. googletag.cmd.push “We tried not to speak about it too much,” Head Coach Graeme Eastwood told the County Derry Post, with a tone engulfed by acceptance. His focus is on the now. After an extended break, Limavady gathered in recent weeks to pick up the pieces and plan for next season. “The boys took up where they left off, had a super attitude and we didnt lose too many players,” Eastwood continued. Scrum-half Jamie Millar transferred to City of Derry in search of first XV rugby and hooker Luke Montgomery found travelling up and down to Belfast for training and games not sustainable. Both are from Limavady and the door will always be open. googletag.cmd.push “We cant hold them back from playing rugby somewhere , we wished them well and they will be back at some stage,” Eastwood said. Last season wasnt the only time Limavady were pipped at the finish line. In Eastwoods first season,  , they topped the table by a point before losing the title with a defeat in the final game.  Coaches with some of Limavady’s new signings  “From a coaching point of view, the improvement is important. We hardly won a game up until Christmas, the year before I came in, and the following year itshows how much work the boys are putting in. “To go unbeaten last season, it shows the boys have been putting the invaluable work in on the training pitch. There were a few of them flirting with retirement, but every one of them is chomping at the bit.” Eastwood believes the club is in a strong place, both on and off the pitch. An acquired grant helped kit out the clubs gym and they now have access to three grass pitches, as well as the G facility at Scroggy Road. “As a club in the North West,you look at how Coleraine reacted last year, we were above Ballymoney and City of Derry were at the bottom ofC,” he points out. “We would like to think we are well up there and are attracting players from Coleraine, Ballymoney and Derry, who want to come to us to play an attractive brand of rugby and to a club on the up. “We have a few boys around  and , but the average age is in around ,  and . That team could stay together,they want, for the next four or five years and try and be successful. “As a club, we want to go upand we want to challenge again at the top end of junior rugby. Whatever way it has happened, we have not been able to do that. Hopefully this season we can try and recty it,” Eastwood hopes. One of those flirting with the idea of retirement was Jody McMurray, who doubles up as assistant coach after moving to the club with Eastwood. “Heruns the backs and this is probably his last year donning the boots, so he wants to go out with a bit of a bang,” Graeme reveals. Peter Wilson mixes playing with his duties as the skills coach, with Oisin Quinn now going into his second season in charge of the teams Strength and Conditioning. “He has worked wonders,” Graeme endorses. “He is very good with the injury prevention stuff, touch wood last season we had a broken bone here and there, but we didnt have one muscle strain and his inclusion is invaluable to us. He had the boys in tip top form. “For someone new to the rugby setup, he has really put his hand up to what we are trying to do over the last  to  months,” he said of Quinn, who has worked with Derry GAA teams and owns his own gym. “He has been a great addition to our coaching team and we are grateful he is staying for another season.” On the field, Limavady have had a productive off-season, with  players joining the , against only Jamie Millar and Luke Montgomerys departures. In particular, there has been an improved link with the local Limavady Grammar School. “We have got a really good connection and we are trying to build that link. Like every sport, having that link between schools and the youth setup is very important. Teams cant survive with bringing in playersevery year,” Eastwood added. He has high hopes for Ben McMillan, who has came in as hooker from the school, prop John McMichael s from the Academy and another from the Grammar School, Joe McCartney, younger brother of full-back Jim. “We have a really good mix,” Eastwood continued. “On top of that, we have brought in Craig Hueywho brings over  years of AIL senior experience, Jack Beattie a winger from Derry who played at Ulster youth level has also joined. “We have kept Jody McMurray, who has over  years experience, and Stuart Morrow who is an ex-club international.” Eastwood feels his side punches above their weight and with the disappointing end to the season, there will be a renewed vigour to finish the job this time. “All we can do is prepare as best we can and hopefully everything unfolds in front of us”, he said, referring to the complications of preparing a team with the cloud of a second Covid spike a possibility. “We know it is going to be dficult, other teams will be playing catchup and will have done their best over the summer to make sure they are strong as possible “I always day  we keep our own house in order and worry about how we train and play, then we will never be too far away,” Eastwood added. He feels the club would hold their own in Division , should they advance at the end of the season when it begins. “If you look at where theyhave come from, six years ago they were in Division  and not knowing where they were going. “Now you have ex internationals and boys leaving AIL clubs to come to Limavady because of what we are trying to do down here, it is exciting times,” Eastwood states. Its all with the sobering thought of needing to deliver. He uses the statement - nobody remembers anybody that doesnt win anything – to remind himself of what is at stake. “We are unfortunate, in that we couldve had two league titles in two years. We got beat in the semi-final of a junior cup, we won the conference Division , one the club has never won. “We want the big one. If you are top of the tree after  games, you are the best team that season and hopefully we can go a bit further this year and try and win it.” Thats the focus. It is that simple. Eastwood has organised games with AIL side Ballymena and Ulster Division  side Cooke for September. “They are two good tests, so we can be where we want to be at for our first league game. It will give us a few weeks to fix anything we see is needing addressed,” Eastwood concludes. The new season is about unfinished business.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thats all they needed. Twelve months after surrendering the league title on the final day, Limavady were untouchable at the top of the table. A - victory at Ards saw Graeme Eastwoods side with one hand and the four fingers of the other on the trophy. With  wins from as many games, as well as  bonus points earned, Limavady accumulated  points out of a possible . The clubs seconds were second in the league and had a Forster Plate semi-final to look forward to. The first team had five of their six remaining league games at home, where they were unbeaten during Eastwoods tenure. Just shy of their meeting with second placed Ballymoney, Covid- dragged the sporting landscape to a halt and with the finish line in sight, their season of effort was gone. googletag.cmd.push “We tried not to speak about it too much,” Head Coach Graeme Eastwood told the County Derry Post, with a tone engulfed by acceptance. His focus is on the now. After an extended break, Limavady gathered in recent weeks to pick up the pieces and plan for next season. “The boys took up where they left off, had a super attitude and we didnt lose too many players,” Eastwood continued. Scrum-half Jamie Millar transferred to City of Derry in search of first XV rugby and hooker Luke Montgomery found travelling up and down to Belfast for training and games not sustainable. Both are from Limavady and the door will always be open. googletag.cmd.push “We cant hold them back from playing rugby somewhere , we wished them well and they will be back at some stage,” Eastwood said. Last season wasnt the only time Limavady were pipped at the finish line. In Eastwoods first season,  , they topped the table by a point before losing the title with a defeat in the final game.  Coaches with some of Limavady’s new signings  “From a coaching point of view, the improvement is important. We hardly won a game up until Christmas, the year before I came in, and the following year itshows how much work the boys are putting in. “To go unbeaten last season, it shows the boys have been putting the invaluable work in on the training pitch. There were a few of them flirting with retirement, but every one of them is chomping at the bit.” Eastwood believes the club is in a strong place, both on and off the pitch. An acquired grant helped kit out the clubs gym and they now have access to three grass pitches, as well as the G facility at Scroggy Road. “As a club in the North West,you look at how Coleraine reacted last year, we were above Ballymoney and City of Derry were at the bottom ofC,” he points out. “We would like to think we are well up there and are attracting players from Coleraine, Ballymoney and Derry, who want to come to us to play an attractive brand of rugby and to a club on the up. “We have a few boys around  and , but the average age is in around ,  and . That team could stay together,they want, for the next four or five years and try and be successful. “As a club, we want to go upand we want to challenge again at the top end of junior rugby. Whatever way it has happened, we have not been able to do that. Hopefully this season we can try and recty it,” Eastwood hopes. One of those flirting with the idea of retirement was Jody McMurray, who doubles up as assistant coach after moving to the club with Eastwood. “Heruns the backs and this is probably his last year donning the boots, so he wants to go out with a bit of a bang,” Graeme reveals. Peter Wilson mixes playing with his duties as the skills coach, with Oisin Quinn now going into his second season in charge of the teams Strength and Conditioning. “He has worked wonders,” Graeme endorses. “He is very good with the injury prevention stuff, touch wood last season we had a broken bone here and there, but we didnt have one muscle strain and his inclusion is invaluable to us. He had the boys in tip top form. “For someone new to the rugby setup, he has really put his hand up to what we are trying to do over the last  to  months,” he said of Quinn, who has worked with Derry GAA teams and owns his own gym. “He has been a great addition to our coaching team and we are grateful he is staying for another season.” On the field, Limavady have had a productive off-season, with  players joining the , against only Jamie Millar and Luke Montgomerys departures. In particular, there has been an improved link with the local Limavady Grammar School. “We have got a really good connection and we are trying to build that link. Like every sport, having that link between schools and the youth setup is very important. Teams cant survive with bringing in playersevery year,” Eastwood added. He has high hopes for Ben McMillan, who has came in as hooker from the school, prop John McMichael s from the Academy and another from the Grammar School, Joe McCartney, younger brother of full-back Jim. “We have a really good mix,” Eastwood continued. “On top of that, we have brought in Craig Hueywho brings over  years of AIL senior experience, Jack Beattie a winger from Derry who played at Ulster youth level has also joined. “We have kept Jody McMurray, who has over  years experience, and Stuart Morrow who is an ex-club international.” Eastwood feels his side punches above their weight and with the disappointing end to the season, there will be a renewed vigour to finish the job this time. “All we can do is prepare as best we can and hopefully everything unfolds in front of us”, he said, referring to the complications of preparing a team with the cloud of a second Covid spike a possibility. “We know it is going to be dficult, other teams will be playing catchup and will have done their best over the summer to make sure they are strong as possible “I always day  we keep our own house in order and worry about how we train and play, then we will never be too far away,” Eastwood added.

Banagher defeated their neighbours in the  and  semi-finals before going down to Slaughtneil. The Lynchs have brought through a host of new players in the intervening years from their Ulster minor winning teams and have went toe to toe with the Emmets in the last two seasons. Geoffrey McGonigle has added to his management team. Former Dunloy goalkeeper Shane Elliott and Ryan ONeill join Ronan McCloskey in the setup. In a change to their team structure, Derry goalkeeper Sean Kelly played outfield last season but he has replaced BJ Lagan between the posts. googletag.cmd.push In the first round this season, they were - to - ahead against Swatragh and were cruising but failed to match the Swatragh workrate before losing their stranglehold of the game. In their game, Banagher led Coleraine by five points after the first quarter but it was the visitors to Fr McNally Park who took control. Darragh Cartins last gasp free earned them a draw but Banaghers body language told a story of dejection. The one thing that will raise them will be the sight of the Kevin Lynchs jersey and local bragging rights is everything. They met in the league last season and it was hell for leather. googletag.cmd.push Selector Ronan McCloskey stated after the Swatragh game that his side had plenty to improve on and they will be keen to put the record straight. In the other game in the section, all is to play for as Swatragh take on Coleraine, two teams who will have taken a lot out of their first round outings. For Coleraine manager Brendan McNicholl, it will be about assessing who all is available after last weekends football championship. It was touch and gothey would even get a team to play Banagher, such is their limited squad. They were minus Ruairi Mooney, Liam and Barry McGoldrick. Swatragh were upbeat after their spirited display in the Kevin Lynch Park monsoon but Declan McGuckin and Seamus Bradley will need to address their poor start that left them with a mountain to climb. They will need to get more scores from open playthey are to see off Coleraine. In the other group, merciless Slaughtneil take on Lavey where a win would seal a semi-final berth and allow breathing space during a hectic period for dual players. Gerald Bradley didnt start against Screen and could come into contention, but Michael McShane will be without Karl McKaigue following his Achilles tendon injury. The champions will have to plan without the suspended Jerome McGuigan but they have plenty more in reserve. Liam Cassidy, Prionsias Burke, Cormac McKenna and minor star Shea Cassidy could all come into the selection thoughts. Lavey lost Ryan Mulholland with broken fingers in their win over Na Magha and will need to offer more in front of the posts, with Johnny McGarveys side hitting close to  wides in their opener. Fintan Bradley, Paddy Henry and Ciaran Hendry were their scorers, but its hard to see them getting anything from this game. Ballinascreen manager Cathal McDaid will be looking for a reaction from his sides heavy defeat at Emmet Park to take into their clash with Na Magha. They will take positives with the appetite shown in the opening  minutes and how the use of Martin Mulgrews short puck-outs worked. Paul Cleary is carrying all their scoring threat and that will be a concern. Na Magha, minus Alan Grant, stuck with Lavey every step of the way and they will be keen to build on that as they strive to break away from their tag as a junior team. A win for Ballinascreen could setup a showdown with Lavey in Round , where the winner would advance to the senior semi-finals. The top two teams from each section will advance to the senior semi-finals, where the losers will play in the intermediate final. The bottom two teams in each group will make up the junior championship semi-finals.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Regularly setting top  times throughout the event, the -year-old and co-driver Keaton Williams soon got to grips with the unique Italian roads, to complete their first event since March’s Covid- lockdown halted all rallying in Ireland and the UK. The duo also upheld Irish honours at the event, with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy entering two drivers on the event which saw no less than  Hyundai i R’s tackle the event, joining World Rally Championship stars Ott Taumlnak and Thierry Neuville in their i Coupe WRC’s. googletag.cmd.push Like most aspiring young rally drivers, McErlean’s season was decimated by the Covid- outbreak and had his  plans quashed by the cancellation of the British Rally Championship earlier in the year. After a tricky opening round of the BRC in Wales in which the  Junior BRC champion impressed onlookers with a string of top five times, he was eager toto the stages and thanks to the help of the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing, a deal was done to head to Italy for Rally di Alba. Although McErlean, the current Billy Coleman Award winner, had technically competed in Italy before, at the Monza Rally Show, the event would mark his first closed road event in the Hyundai outside of Ireland and with over  kilometers of special stages ahead, McErlean would need to focus all his energy on theto competitive action. googletag.cmd.push A loop of three stages would be repeated three times and whilst becoming more familiar with the stages would inevitably assist McErlean, the loose gravel and rocks pulled onto the stages with each pass offered an additional hazard, especially towards the closing stages of the rally.After a positive pre-event Shakedown on Saturday, McErlean was eager to settle into a comfortable rhythm on the stages in his Michelin shod Hyundai and opened his account with an impressive thoverall stage time on the first test of the event with many experienced Italian crews behind. His form continued throughout the opening loop to land thoverall after three stages. Fourteenth fastest on the fourth counter was a highlight and an indication of just how well McErlean was bedding into the Italian roads, climbing one place to thin the process. Sadly, a technical issue on the fth stage meant he and Williams would have to carry out roadside repairs to the i R before heading into the sixth test. Those repairs would eat into his road section time, handing him an unfortunate -second penalty before he was able to attempt the stage. Luckily McErlean was able to nurse the i back to service where the Philip Case Rallysport team worked against the clock to get the Hyundai back to full health. A mature drive over the final three stages saw McErlean further cement his position toto Alba with an impressive top twenty result. “I’m delighted to have reached the finish today and although it wasn’t entirely trouble-free, I really enjoyed the experience, it was a real honour to compete on such a fantastic occasion and with an amazing atmosphere,”said McErlean. “We came here with a clear goal to get experience and build the pace throughout the rally and I feel we did just that. Analysing the times and considering the lack of experience in Italy it was very much mission accomplished throughout the weekend and without the time penalty, the result would have been as good as I could wish for. I’m happy with the way both Keaton and I managed the situation we found ourselves in and got the job done on the way to the sixth test to enable us to carry on. Resilience and thinking on your feet are a key focus of the Motorsport Rally Academy so we were very able to put that into practice. The pace this weekend shows that I`m heading very much in the right direction and I am eager to make more plans to take that forward during the remainder of the season. I’d like to thank all our backers, Sean McHugh and John Coyne from the MI Rally Academy, Andrew Johns from Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing and Tim Hoare from Michelin for all their invaluable support once again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Regularly setting top  times throughout the event, the -year-old and co-driver Keaton Williams soon got to grips with the unique Italian roads, to complete their first event since March’s Covid- lockdown halted all rallying in Ireland and the UK. The duo also upheld Irish honours at the event, with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy entering two drivers on the event which saw no less than  Hyundai i R’s tackle the event, joining World Rally Championship stars Ott Taumlnak and Thierry Neuville in their i Coupe WRC’s. googletag.cmd.push Like most aspiring young rally drivers, McErlean’s season was decimated by the Covid- outbreak and had his  plans quashed by the cancellation of the British Rally Championship earlier in the year. After a tricky opening round of the BRC in Wales in which the  Junior BRC champion impressed onlookers with a string of top five times, he was eager toto the stages and thanks to the help of the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing, a deal was done to head to Italy for Rally di Alba. Although McErlean, the current Billy Coleman Award winner, had technically competed in Italy before, at the Monza Rally Show, the event would mark his first closed road event in the Hyundai outside of Ireland and with over  kilometers of special stages ahead, McErlean would need to focus all his energy on theto competitive action. googletag.cmd.push A loop of three stages would be repeated three times and whilst becoming more familiar with the stages would inevitably assist McErlean, the loose gravel and rocks pulled onto the stages with each pass offered an additional hazard, especially towards the closing stages of the rally.After a positive pre-event Shakedown on Saturday, McErlean was eager to settle into a comfortable rhythm on the stages in his Michelin shod Hyundai and opened his account with an impressive thoverall stage time on the first test of the event with many experienced Italian crews behind. His form continued throughout the opening loop to land thoverall after three stages. Fourteenth fastest on the fourth counter was a highlight and an indication of just how well McErlean was bedding into the Italian roads, climbing one place to thin the process. Sadly, a technical issue on the fth stage meant he and Williams would have to carry out roadside repairs to the i R before heading into the sixth test. Those repairs would eat into his road section time, handing him an unfortunate -second penalty before he was able to attempt the stage. Luckily McErlean was able to nurse the i back to service where the Philip Case Rallysport team worked against the clock to get the Hyundai back to full health. A mature drive over the final three stages saw McErlean further cement his position toto Alba with an impressive top twenty result. “I’m delighted to have reached the finish today and although it wasn’t entirely trouble-free, I really enjoyed the experience, it was a real honour to compete on such a fantastic occasion and with an amazing atmosphere,”said McErlean. “We came here with a clear goal to get experience and build the pace throughout the rally and I feel we did just that. Analysing the times and considering the lack of experience in Italy it was very much mission accomplished throughout the weekend and without the time penalty, the result would have been as good as I could wish for. I’m happy with the way both Keaton and I managed the situation we found ourselves in and got the job done on the way to the sixth test to enable us to carry on. Resilience and thinking on your feet are a key focus of the Motorsport Rally Academy so we were very able to put that into practice. The pace this weekend shows that I`m heading very much in the right direction and I am eager to make more plans to take that forward during the remainder of the season. I’d like to thank all our backers, Sean McHugh and John Coyne from the MI Rally Academy, Andrew Johns from Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing and Tim Hoare from Michelin for all their invaluable support once again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by. Miceal Rooney put Kilcoo two clear five minutes from the short whistle, while OrsquoHiggins scored a beauty right on half time to leave it - to - to Mickey Moranrsquos side.The lsquoFord got the best possible start to the second half with Conor Maginn and substitute Cathal Burns finding their range to put them ahead. It was tit for tat for the next phase of the game and with ten minutes left Kilcoo lead by one thanks to scores from Jerome Johnston, Paul Greenan and Conor Laverty.The games turning point came on the rd minute. A brilliant move involving Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Ryan Johnston and Miceal Rooney placed the ing Ceilum Doherty in and he palmed home from close range.The home side never gave in though and showed great resolve, Marc Reid even coming up to point from distance in what was a superb inidual score and one of the highlights of the game.But the Magpies held out, Doherty adding a good score to seal the three-point victory margin.Bryansford: Marc Reid , Stephen Toner, Ryan McDonald, Aaron McDonald, Timmy Hanna, Conor Maginn , Danny Savage , Fintan Canavan, Conor Devlin, Corey Laverty, Ryan OrsquoHiggins , Paddy Sheridan , Thomas McAnerney, David McKenna, Daniel McDonald.Subs used: Cathal Burns , Chris Clarke , Jack Maginn, Niall OrsquoHiggins, Lewis Casement.Cill Chua: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Ryan McEvoy, Tiernan Fettes, Miceal Rooney , Darryl Branagan, Eugene Branagan, Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Paul Greenan , Shealan Johnston, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty , Martin Devlin , Ryan Johnston, Niall McEvoy.Subs used:Ceilum Doherty , Felim McGreevy.Referee: Neil Cousins .Bryansford -Cill Chua -ACFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Downpatrick motorists facing further disruption  ","story":"MOTORISTS are bracing themselves for five weeks of town centre disruption in Downpatrick.Work on a pound, sewer improvement scheme starts next week, with NI Water contractors focusing on key areas.They include New Bridge Street, Church Street, Bridge Street, Saul Street, Saul Road, Marian Park, Drumlin Park, Scotch Street, Market Street, Market Lane, Stream Street, Racecourse Hill, Ardglass Road, Edward Street, Knocknashinna Road and the Knockchree Road.A number of short lane closures are expected, with two-way traffic maintained at all locations using temporary traffic controls.Vehicular access for residents and businesses will also be maintained as far as possible but there may be some slight delays according to NI Water which has confirmed that pedestrian access will be available at all times. Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe.

Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the

heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to

not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my

The lsquowallrsquo to the finish line had a maximum gradient of an eye-watering %..In the early stages Hanna found himself in the leading group of five with the cream of the Italian mountain racing scene.Included in the quality field were lsquovertical kilometrersquo specialist Henry Aymonod, Davide Magnini, one of the best uphill and sky runners in the world, former European mountain racing champion Martin Dematteis and Frenchman Sylvain Cachard.At around half distance Aymonod put in a surge and Hanna tried to follow with Dematteis being ped from the group.On to the upper slopes and Hanna was at the back of the group of three in fourth place. Then with less than m nearly vertical metres to go, he surged past Cachard to move into thirrd place and crossed the line in  minutes and  seconds. The winner, Aymonod, was home in : with Magnini second in :. Hannarsquos training regime, which included running upwards of  miles a week near his home on the Slieve Croob, gave him the strength to tackle back-to-back races.So after the lung-bursting steepness of Saturday, Sunday morning at :am brought the challenge of the Fletta Trail over close to half-marathon distance with climbing and descending back to the starting point in the village of Malonno.Francesco Puppi, the local Italian favourite and second in the World Long Distance Championships in Patagonia last November and world champion in , was in the race, fresh after not racing on Saturday.Seasoned Italian international Cesare Maestri was also in the field and he too had not raced the day before.As the race set off, these two were joined at the front by Francersquos Sylvain Cachard. Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness. Itrsquos said that lsquounited we stand, ided we fallrsquo but we have no intention of falling anytime soon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11665714.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Around , Japanese citizens perished under Hiroshima’s and Nagasaki’s deadly mushroom clouds, and many more as radiation mercilessly ravaged survivors’ bodies.The Hiroshima Memorial Peace Park’s Children’s Peace Monument commemorates a heroic little Japanese girl, Sadako Sasaki, born in January .Her family home was about . km from the location of the atomic eruption in Hiroshima just over two years later. Her dad was a hairdresser who was drafted into the Japanese army shortly after her birth,On August ,  she was at home with her mum when the atomic bomb erupted above the city.The blast blew little Sadako out of the house, seemingly uninjured, and her mother fled the firestorm carrying her daughter to a relative’s house nearby. They were unaware of the invisible but deadly ‘black rain’ - atomic fallout.Of approximately , people in the city at the time some , had died by the end of December, over half of that number on the day of the bombing. The Sasaki family opened a new barbershop in the city in .Sadako was a keen athlete at school, hoping to become a PE teacher, when she started to look a little pale.Toward the end of November  she caught a cold and swellings developed on her neck. When Sadako’s whole face started swelling she was taken to a doctor for a medical examination early in .But her symptoms persisted and got worse, with nasty skin blemishes appearing on her body.Sadako went to a hospital for more precise testing. The diagnosis was leukaemia - the result of her exposure to ‘black rain’. The doctor told her dad on February ,  that she’d probably only a year to live.On  February Sadako entered the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital where her family and school chums visited her regularly. About a month later she was enrolled for Junior High School, but sadly, she was never to attend.There is an ancient Japanese legend that saysyou fold , origami paper cranes the gods will grant you a wish. Stories y as to who told her the legend. Some say it was her roommate or school-chum in the hospital, some say it was her dad, but Sadako started folding little paper cranes with all the paper at her disposal.She made them from packing paper, medicine wrappings, or any other paper she could get a hold of.Some stories say that Sadako never finished her thousand paper cranes, that she only finished  and her family and friends finished the remainder for her.Sadako stringed thread through lines of cranes and hung them from the ceiling of her room in the hospital. Toward the end of September  her white blood cells began to increase critically and she could no longer walk unassisted.On the morning of October , surrounded by her family, Sadako passed away.Some of her little paper cranes were put in her coffin when she was buried.And the memory of Sadako lives on.Her friends raised funds to build a memorial to her and to all of the children who had died from the effects of the atomic bomb.In , a statue of Sadako holding a golden crane was unveiled in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. At the foot of the statue is a plaque that reads: “This is our cry. This is our prayer. Peace in the world.”Her family donated some of her origami cranes to the Hiroshima Peace Centre and they’ve become a symbol of peace for children all over the world, displayed in the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, in the   Tribute Centre in New York and in the Austrian Study Centre for Peace and Conflict Resolution - to name just a few venues worldwide.

MartinThursday, th August , : pm\"\"Extending southern presidential vote into NI is an insidious proposal which will promote further ision hereThe parties to the  Belfast Agreement, endorsed in a referendum, committed themselves to ‘partnership, equality and mutual respect as the basis of relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South, and between these islands’. In terms of North and South, the ‘totality of relationships’ was spelled out in detail.The Republic of Ireland removed its territorial claim on Northern Ireland and, in , a North South Ministerial Council was created to oversee co-operation between the two jurisdictions.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Letter to the editorThe removal of the South’s claim represented official recognition of, and respect for, Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom, as affirmed where in the agreement.More than twenty years later, however, the Southern government — backed by nationalists in Northern Ireland — is seeking to re-ignite irredentism by including in its programme for government a referendum on the extension of presidential elections into Northern Ireland.This is not provided for as part of the totality of north-south relationships. It was not agreed in , and no agreement with unionists in Northern Ireland or the UK government is being sought. It is a unilateral breach of the Belfast Agreement. What was the point of removing a theoretical irredentist claimit was to be replaced by irredentism in practice Proponents of extending the electorate for the Southern president into Northern Ireland argue that it is commonplace for states to allow citizens resident abroad to vote in elections, and particularly presidential elections. This is disingenuous. The situation between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is unique. First, no state in the world other than the Irish Republic extends its citizenship as of right to people born in a particular region of a neighbouring state. Second, none has entered into a treaty with another state defining the ‘totality of relationships’ with it. Third, where voting rights are granted to citizens resident abroad it iniably requires them to have lived in the state and have had a home address within the state: this is not the case with people born in Northern Ireland, most of whom have never lived in the Republic.This is an insidious proposal which will have the effect of promoting further ision in Northern Ireland, with a de facto nationalist-only election, and treating the province as though it were part of the Republic. While the intentions of proponents in the South are not clear, from the perspective of nationalists in Northern Ireland, this is part of a process of re-orienting politics towards the Republic and away from the UK, with a view to undermining people’s sense of belonging to the UK and thus manipulating the context for a future ‘border poll’. In this sense, it can be seen as part of a strategy that also involves encouraging Southern parties to organise in Northern Ireland, seeking to remove automatic UK citizenship from Northern Ireland people and, of course, promoting an economic border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. It is not surprising that Emma De Souza, who campaigned unsuccessfully to remove automatic UK citizenship has now been appointed as a campaigner for this further nationalist cause.But why is the proposal being met with indference from unionists and the UK government  Why is there no protest  Why are nationalists allowed to disrespect the Belfast Agreement, continually pushing the envelope beyond what was agreed  Why are they apparently pushing at an open door J.
