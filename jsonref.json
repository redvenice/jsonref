I live in a building with an autistic man who has bipolar, he has angry outbursts and last week said something really unkind, he struggles with understanding he’s in the wrong \u0026amp apologising but gave me this today.’‘Sometimes I say things in the heat of the moment I do not always mean.‘I hope you will accept my sorry gifts.‘Love from Christopher.‘P.S. I really do like you and your family and dog.’Ruby tells  that Christopher is normally ‘like a giant teddy bear’.She said: ‘He is mostly very sweet but has his moments where he can be irritable and unkind mainly due to his diagnosis on the autism spectrum and bipolar disorder.(Picture: Ruby King)‘The manager of the service told me Christopher was doing something for me, to give me some warning so I wouldn’t be overwhelmed, so I went about my afternoon of shopping in town and came back around 4pm.‘I am now aware that Christopher walked up to the local supermarket whilst I was out and bought me a card, cookies and a plant.‘He expressed to staff that he was feeling something strange in his stomach, they asked if he was nervous and he said yes, they explained that is called butterflies.‘Staff invited me downstairs to his flat and I went in, he couldn’t make eye contact with me but said here you go and gave me the cards and apology gifts.‘One of the staff was blubbering as this is a very out of character thing for Christopher to do. I read the card and started crying too as I was just so touched, I said to him “I know you hate hugs but tough I’m giving you one”.(Picture: Ruby King)‘So I quickly gave him a hug as he is not a fan of being touched and expressed my gratefulness for his apology and expressed that he didn’t need to have got me gifts, his apology would have been enough but thank you anyway.’According to Ruby, Christopher had seen her gardening a few days prior to the gifts and wanted to go out and join her but felt he couldn’t.She left the flat saying thank you again, as she was feeling very overwhelmed by the whole situation.She continued: ‘The next day I was leaving the building to go to my Grandma’s for the weekend and he shouted me out of his window and waved, of course, I waved back and I haven’t seen him since but everything is all good.‘I forgave him, I understand that it wasn’t him truly speaking, I’ve said things I’ve regretted when I haven’t been in a good frame of mind so I sympathise towards him.’Since sharing her tweet, Ruby has gone viral with more than 35,000 retweets and 230,000 likes.(Picture: Ruby King)She said she’s been absolutely ‘blown away’ by the response, telling us: ‘I had simply put it on to show my friends and followers the sweet gesture, as I share a lot of my life on Twitter as I am a blogger.‘I kept thinking it’s going to die down but as time went on it got crazier, my phone kept crashing I just couldn’t keep up with it.‘Out of thousands and thousands of repliesquoted tweets, I had a handful of negative responses, mainly about sharing his letter online. I chose to share it as there is such a misconception of autism that we are all non-verbal, illiterate and low functioning when that is far from the truth.‘Autism is a spectrum and some of the smartest people in the world are on this spectrum – they just display different difficulties to what people may expect from the stereotype.Ruby adds that soon, she’ll be moving out of her flat and into a more independent service.She would like to keep in touch with Christopher, but it will be difficult as she feels it could cause more harm than good.She tells us: ‘I think me leaving will upset him and if I stayed in touch he wouldn’t be able to move on‘Before I leave I will spend an evening with him, perhaps have a takeaway or go out for the day as I know he will miss my company greatly, as I will his.’MORE: How chronic illness and mental health are inextricably linkedMORE: Photographer’s emotional portraits will make you want to give your grandparents a call"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/12/4BF8F63E00000578-0-image-m-32_1525778119619.jpg","title":"True story Japans WWII human experiments Unit 731","story":"    Horrendous: Japanese scientists carry out a vivisection - a dissection of a live human being without anesthetics - just one of dozens of human experiments carried out at Unit 371It was a completely covert operation, and during WWII it was at first described as a lumber mill, then a water purification plant, and even today, awareness of Unit 731 in and outside of Japan is low.Today, its remains, now a museum,  echo many of the chilling hallmarks of a former Nazi death camp  with its disused railway track and ghostly buildings.96-year-old WWII vet gets degree delayed by nearly 7 decades¿Nazi Grandma¿, 89, who went on the run in Germany to escape...Share this articleOne structure still today contains rows of cages that housed giant rats which Japanese doctors used to produce the bubonic plague.The horrendous disease was later unleashed on hundreds of thousands of Chinese, by dropping  plague-carrying fleas on villages as part of experiments in biochemical warfare.Photographs from the new book - Unit 731: Laboratory of the Devil, Auschwitz of the East - shows Japanese soldiers taking part in a vivisection - carrying out operations on a live person to study living tissue and organs.

She has been cut open from throat to pelvis, the baby exposed in her belly.Despite knowledge of a large number of babies born at Unit 731, there are no accounts of any survivors - including children.           Unit of torture: The senior officers of Unit 731 are pictured during World War II          Chinese adults and children have been infected with an unknown illness and are being monitored by Japanese medical staff at Unit 731 Some of those at Unit 731 died in experiments testing weapons such as grenades and biological bombs. Others are said to have been buried alive or drowned. As well as the 3,000  killed  at Unit 731, tens of thousands are also thought to have died when the Japanese used what they had learned against their enemies in the war - mainly Chinese civilians.In addition to releasing plague-infected fleas, the Japanese are known to have planted typhoid fever, cholera and other diseases into the water systems in Chinese villages.          Evil: The head of Unit 731, Shirō Ishii, who was awarded immunity by the US after the warDespite thousands of victims, the Japanese government denied the existence of the unit until 1998, when the Supreme Court indirectly acknowledged it by ruling there was an academic consensus that Unit 731 existed. The man largely responsible for the operation of Unit 731, Shirō Ishii, escaped punishment after the war.Ishii, and several others from Unit 731, were granted immunity by the United States in exchange for full disclosure of the results of their biological warfare experiments.Ishii died of throat cancer in Tokyo, Japan, in 1959, aged 67.The Soviet Union did hold trials for eleven of the scientist working at Unit 731 at the end of the war.They each  received between two and 25 years in a Siberian labour camp.Last month, a group of Japanese scholars announced that they are is set to publish a list of 3,607 members of Unit 731, including 52 surgeons, 49 engineers, 38 nurses and 1,117 combat medics. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/12/4BF8747000000578-5703293-image-m-23_1525779465935.jpg","title":"Extraordinary snaps joyful Meghan Markle Italian holiday date Prince Harry","story":"    Meghan\u0027s unofficial wedding planner and best friend Jessica Mulroney posted this picture on Instagram in August 2016 – a month after Meghan had her first date with Harry.

Since then they have been to watch a Toronto Blue Jays baseball match together, holidayed in Italy and Meghan has taught Jessica\u0027s daughter to dance.\u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle said. \u0027Meghan adores Jessica, not just as a friend but also as someone whose taste and style are impeccable. Meghan looks up to Jessica and has, to a certain degree, modelled herself on her.\u0027     Jessica is Meghan\u0027s best friend and will be there when she marries Harry at Windsor Castle on May 19. Meghan is known to lean on her best friend for style and fashion advice          Jessica\u0027s pictures give a revealing insight into the fun nature of their friendship including the time when Meghan invited her backstage on Suits where she looks through wedding dresses          Meghan Markle is reportedly set to wear a Ralph and Russo gown (not pictured)  when she walks down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor on May 19Unlike Meghan, the former Jessica Brownstein, came from a privileged background as a member of Canada\u0027s Browns shoes dynasty, which is worth a reported £50 million.She attended an exclusive all-girls\u0027 school, before going to McGill University, where she studied industrial relations and economics. She then launched her own business importing luxury lingerie.After a successful career as a stylist – with her own TV slot – and wedding planner, she was propelled to the A list in 2008 after marrying the eldest son of Brian Mulroney.The couple has three children: twins Brian and John, now seven, and daughter Ivy now four, who are rumoured to be page boys and flower girl at the Royal wedding.Jessica and Meghan bonded over their shared passion for yoga, Pilates, dogs and philanthropy. They are so close that she has been dubbed \u0027Meghan\u0027s girl Friday\u0027 - Meghan describes herself as \u0027Aunty Meg\u0027 to her three children.           The girls enjoy the picturesque view from their hotel room on the trip          \u0027Cocktail o\u0027clock\u0027 wrote Jessica on this photo of the spread the two women enjoyed in Positano          Breakfast is served: A look at the stunning view from the hotel where the two women stayed on the trip           Jessica is so close to Royal bride-to-be Meghan that she even posted this adorable snap of the Suits star teaching her young daughter to tap dance along with the caption: \u0027Ladies Night\u0027          Jessica and Meghan bonded over their shared passion for yoga, Pilates, dogs and philanthropy.

She wore a coat by Canadian designer Sentaler and people went crazy for it. We had created this media frenzy, like you see with anything Kate wears.\u0027But it was only after Meghan began dating Prince Harry in 2016 that Mulroney became a global name. It was in her house that the couple sought refuge when news of their relationship broke.Then, last September, as speculation of an engagement reached fever pitch, Mulroney was in a box with Meghan, her mother Doria, and Markus Anderson, for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games.Harry joined them for the final 20 minutes of the show, standing arm in arm with Meghan and planting a kiss on her check as they watched Bryan Adams sing love songs.And, when Harry and Meghan got engaged last November, Mulroney was credited with orchestrating the outfit – a white wrap coat by The Line, PAROSH green dress and Aquazzura nude pumps.She is also believed to be the brains behind Meghan\u0027s outfits for many of her official engagements and is instrumental in helping her choose her wedding dress.    The relaxed snaps are a far cry from Meghan\u0027s polished appearances with Harry, such as the Anzac Day Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey last month  The candid photos show just how close the women are as Jessica and Meghan spend time away from the spotlight on holiday  A source close to Maghan has revealed how the friendship has blossomed since their time together in Toronto.  \u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle saidThe couple had a dress rehearsal on Suits when Jessica helped her choose the Anne Barge Versailles dress from Jessica\u0027s Kleinfeld Canada bridal boutique when her Suits character Rachel Zane was supposed to marry Mike Ross - only for him to leave her at the altar.She flew to London in January to attend the first fitting and was in London in April when Meghan had her final fitting. Mulroney jetted into Heathrow for a \u0027mini hen party\u0027 and was given a sneak preview of the dress and the wedding venue.She has been so successful in helping Meghan create her \u0027effortless chic\u0027 style that Vogue, editor Edward Enninful believes she could eclipse the Duchess of Cambridge. \u0027Ms Markle is an astonishing fashion sales force, who is setting the industry alight,\u0027 he said recently.A royal source said: \u0027Jessica is Meghan\u0027s BFF (best friend forever) and has been a huge influence. Meghan\u0027s turned to her for advice on everything from the dress, the flowers, decorations in church, the wedding lunch — and even the seating plan. \u0027Although Jess lives in Toronto, the two are on the phone all the time. Meg wanted Jess at the final fitting as it\u0027ll be the most famous dress of the year and she\u0027s quite nervous about it. It all went really well and they were delighted with the result.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/12/4BF87BE700000578-5703381-image-m-12_1525779072907.jpg","title":"Cannes Film Festival no longer let critics movies red carpet","story":"    Cannes has cancelled all advance press screenings so actors and filmmakers\u0027 of bad films don\u0027t have their spirits crushed before the premiereStars would walk down the red carpet blissfully unaware that their film had been given scathing one-star reviews.That model was \u0027blown to bits\u0027 by the internet where reviews on news websites, film blogs, and social media were posted within hours, or even minutes, of the screening.Organisers insisted the first major change to the festival programme in decades was \u0027necessary\u0027 to protect the egos of stars.\u0027The underlying logic was was based on best practice blown to bits by the massive incursion of digital technologies in our professional and personal lives over the past 15 years or so,\u0027 it wrote in a letter to the press seen by The Telegraph.\u0027Basically, as soon as the film is screened, the social networks turn it into confetti-like strips of rumours.\u0027  In 2016 critics savaged The Last Face starring Charlize Theron (left) as the lowest point of actor-director Sean Penn\u0027s (right, with Theron) career          Earlier in 2012, Nicole Kidman had to walk the red carpet after a scene in The Paperboy where her character (pictured) urinates on the one played by Zac Effron made newsThe letter said the new principle was to make the gala session attended by the people who made the film the \u0027veritable first screening\u0027.\u0027When the team walks the red carpet and enters the room... the moment will be far more powerful as no one will have already seen the film,\u0027 it read.Academy of Motion Pictures expels convicted indecent...Kate Winslet urges women to cover up on the red carpet as...Share this articleNumerous Hollywood stars have been glum-faced or asked uncomfortable questions as they walked the red carpet after bad reviews at recent Cannes events.In 2016 critics savaged The Last Face starring Charlize Theron as the lowest point of actor-director Sean Penn\u0027s career.

She says she drinks more now she\u0027s olderI usually celebrate the end of the working week with a drink with colleagues. Later, I’ll toast the weekend with a few large glasses of Merlot, sitting on the sofa at home. With three daughters, grandchildren, a full-time job and a college course, I have lots of demands on me. Wine helps me to relax.I’m an outgoing, sociable person. Graham, my partner, who’s 40, and I will often go out with friends on a Saturday night. If I’m off to a party, I’ll have a couple of cocktails at home to get me in the mood, then switch to red wine once we’re out. I can drink a bottle over the course of an evening and have a few cocktails, too, without any ill-effects.Most of the people I know drink like me, and it certainly doesn’t feel excessive or something to worry about.My alcohol consumption has definitely increased with age. I married and had children young, so had a lot of responsibilities in my 20s. Back then, wine was a rare treat.Sadly, I was widowed young, too. My husband took his own life after suffering from depression. It was a very difficult time for all of us — but even then I rarely drank.But now that the children are grown up with families of their own, and I’m in a happy new relationship, I feel I deserve to enjoy my freedom.I don’t think that it’s impacted on my health or life in a negative way. I don’t suffer hangovers but, admittedly, I don’t sleep brilliantly. Often it takes me an hour or two to fall asleep and I often wake in the night, but I think that is more to do with my age (I’m peri-menopausal).Sunday lunch wouldn’t be the same without wine, and Graham and I usually share a bottle of white with our roast chicken. I wouldn’t say I crave it, but it has become a habit.Sometimes I’ll have a Cointreau, too. It’s a nice way to finish a meal.          Mandie likes a bottle of wine over a Sunday lunch of roast chicken and drinks most nightsDuring the week I drink most nights. I like a glass of wine while I’m cooking and I’ll have another glass or two over dinner. If I’ve got friends over, then the alcohol always flows. We’d have much less fun without it.My daughters barely drink, but they don’t nag me about my habits. The only time they do bring it up is when I complain about my weight — then they’re quick to point out that alcohol is packed with calories. I’m interested to see how I get on without drinking any alcohol for a week.         Accountant who was five times over the limit when she was...¿I wanted to be a nurse ¿ then realised girls can be...Share this articleThe daughter’s storyKala Spokes, 29, is a business development manager and mum to Jack, seven, and Summer, four.

We’re focused on health and fitness and on staying slim.That’s more important than going out and getting drunk.If a girlfriend calls round in the evening, we won’t open a bottle of wine but will have a cup of tea instead. Our only decadence is sharing a bar of chocolate.As I tell Mum when she complains about feeling fat, drink’s full of calories. It boosts your appetite, too, and in my experience those who drink tend to eat more junk.Mum doesn’t sleep well and I think that’s down to the drink. I’ve seen research showing that alcohol means you spend less time in deep sleep and more in the lighter, less satisfying stages.And that is certainly confirmed by my sleep habits: I get eight or nine hours of unbroken sleep most nights and wake up refreshed.That said, I’m no party pooper. I love socialising and chatting with friends — few of whom drink. I think our attitude might have something to do with all the alcohol awareness campaigns we were exposed to while growing up.

Complications are more common in men, pregnant women, children and older patients.Those suffering from recurrent UTIs should be advised that evidence of the preventative benefits of cranberry products is ‘inconclusive’, the draft advice says.It also recommends that doctors limit the amount of antibiotics handed out for UTIs, in a bid to reduce resistance. The guidelines say low-risk patients, such as women who are not pregnant, should be asked to wait for test results to come back.Instead, doctors should ask patients about their pain levels and tell them to take paracetamol and drink plenty of fluids. They can also write a ‘back-up’ prescription which can be used only if the infection does not go away on its own.The immune system can fight mild infections but many UTIs require antibiotics.

Noo noo, of course not. Dear heart, the thought never crossed our minds.He argued simply that it was a frightful bind for ministers to have to work with the burden of this set date for our departure. How much more they could achieve if that date were not there!Lord Butler, from what I could understand, sought to suggest that dropping the date might actually allow Brexit to be delayed for ever, but the duke did not want to pursue that idea.Eurosceptic opposition came from Lord Grocott, a Labour peer who has had to put up with some pretty bad heckling in recent months (his party colleagues at the far end of the Palace of Westminster hate him for siding with the voters).He recalled Parkinson\u0027s Law, which states that \u0027work expands to fill the time available\u0027 and he suspected that the Europhiles were merely attempting to hold up Brexit. His voice went unheeded and the duke\u0027s dismal little delay was approved by a House that, with every day, looks riper for the abattoir.Does this sort of thing help the Remainers? To have an hereditary peer, one of the most blue of all blue-bloods, helping their cause?

There was no sign of holdouts in Lanipuna afterward, he said.Edwin Montoya, 76, had planned to stay to care for animals and keep looters away from his family\u0027s property in neighboring Leilani Estates. But he was forced to evacuate after the new fissures emerged, including one just a mile away.\u0027I\u0027m in my truck right now on my way up the road,\u0027 he said. \u0027The police came down here and made me.\u0027Both communities are in a forested, remote part of the Big Island on the eastern flank of Kilauea volcano, which has been erupting continuously since 1983.In recent years the volcano has mostly released lava in hard-to-reach areas inside a national park or along the coastline. But last week, vents popped open and released lava, gas and steam inside residential neighborhoods.There is no indication when the eruption might stop, or how far the lava might spread.   Gov. David Ige and Brigadier General Kenneth S. Hara, deputy adjutant general of the Hawaii National Guard, hurriedly returned to Hawaii County Civil Defense headquarters soon after news of the latest lava flows broke.The eruption has already claimed 27 homes and a total of 37 structures as lava streams advanced across the island. Scientists have recorded at least 14 vents since the eruption began last week.Leilani Estate had been the main focus of evacuations until Tuesday when the new vents focused efforts on Lanipuna Gardens.

They\u0027re putting first responders at risk.\u0027If you know anyone still out there, encourage them to come in, not only for their own safety, but for safety of the community.\u0027Retired couple Larry and Geri Butler were among the many residents to lose their home in the volcanic eruption.Their son Christian Butler, told CNN his parents only realized they\u0027d lost their house of 15 years after seeing footage of it burning on social media.\u0027They lost everything with the lava and have to start over from scratch,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m not sure that fact has really sunk in with them yet,\u0027 he said, adding that his parents were staying in temporary housing.\u0027They evacuated Thursday afternoon, so there was some time where they had no idea if anything was happening to their home.\u0027           Volunteers and evacuees hold in hands while praying before serving dinner at a makeshift donation center          First Lt. Aaron Hew Len with the US National Guard surveys lava damage in the Leilani Estates subision near Pahoa, Hawaii, David Nail, who moved to Lelani Estates from Orange County, California after his wife was diagnosed with Parkinsons disease, said he has no idea if his house survived the eruption - a 20ft high wall of lava had prevented him getting home.\u0027All we could do was sit there and cry,\u0027 Nail said.Lava flows have covered at least 104 acres of Hawaii since Thursday. Thankfully, no deaths of serious injuries have been reported.Some locals have been leaving offerings to try and appease the volcano goddess Pele during the eruption. But geologists have warned that the eruptions are likely to continue. Hawaii governor David Ige has called for federal assistance as fissures keep spreading from the state\u0027s erupting Kilauea volcano, spewing lava and forcing residents to evacuate. Ige told CNN that residents were feeling helpless in the face of the phenomena.   \u0027There\u0027s a sense that it\u0027s Mother Nature,\u0027 he said. \u0027The lava flow is unpredictable. It\u0027s hard to determine which direction it will go. It starts and stops on a whim. That\u0027s the uncertainty that residents are faced with.\u0027  He revealed he had contacted the White House and the US Federal Emergency Management Authority (FEMA) when he met with people on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island who have left their homes near the Kilauea volcano. Red hot lava flows engulfed homes, trees, cars and streets - with nothing able to stem the inevitable advance of molten rock.            Governor David Ige (pictured speaking with residents yesterday) revealed he had contacted the White House and the US Federal Emergency Management Authority (FEMA) when he met with people on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island who have left their homes near the Kilauea volcano          Lieutenant Aaron Hew Lew, of the Hawaii National Guard, measures levels of toxic sulfur dioxide gas near a lava flow in the Leilani Estates subision during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii          First Lt.

One of the year\u0027s first harvests had been planned for this weekend.\u0027If we lose our farm, we don\u0027t know where we\u0027re going to go. You lose your income and you lose your home at the same time,\u0027 said McArthur, who\u0027s had the farm for about 20 years. \u0027All you can do is pray and hope and try to get all the information you can.\u0027About 250 people and 90 pets spent Saturday night at shelters, the American Red Cross said.The number of lava-venting fissures in the neighborhood grew overnight from eight to as many as 10, Stovall said, though some have quieted at various points.

Cambridge is the only university in Britain to publicly display class lists after Oxford abolished them in 2009. Pictured: The Senate House and Kings College (left)Class lists are currently posted on notice boards outside Senate House, published in the Cambridge University Reporter, and are also published online.In the vote, 412 members of Regent House voted in favour, with 391 against, it was revealed today in Varsity, the university\u0027s in-house newspaper.Graham Virgo, pro-vice-chancellor for education said: \u0027I welcome the result of the ballot which means that all students are now able to choose to opt out from having their names published outside the Senate House or in the Reporter.\u0027This opt out will be implemented immediately. Faculties, departments and colleges will still have access to the full class list for their own internal purposes.\u0027Previously, students could only opt out in exceptional circumstances, after a lengthy, bureaucratic process, and only 86 names were omitted last year.   Campaigners at the university, which has about 21,000 students from all round the world, claimed having their result made public for all to see could affect the mental health of some people.They said the lists are \u0027damaging\u0027 to welfare, can trigger depression and \u0027promote a culture of naming and shaming\u0027.But supporters said it would be sad if a tradition dating back nearly 300 years was abolished.  Until now, applications from students wanting to have their names removed are only considered in \u0027exceptional circumstances. Under the new system, every student can simply tick a box which states they wish to opt out. Martha Krish, students\u0027 union education officer, said last year that the lists had caused \u0027distress and harm\u0027 to countless students and the new system was \u0027a massive improvement\u0027. Oxford University has kept exam results private since October 2009 after 40 per cent of students opted out, citing the Data Protection Act. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/11/4C021B4D00000578-0-image-a-3_1525863038907.jpg","title":"Britains heatwave comes abrupt end temperatures set plummet","story":"    A woman runs past the boating lake as a beautiful morning greets Londoners at Regent\u0027s Park today  Commuters, walkers and runners make their way along the edge of the boating lake at Regent\u0027s Park today          A runner crosses a bridge on a beautiful morning at Regent\u0027s Park in London today as temperatures get to 70F (21C) today  Two dogs run along a footpath, while a woman does the same at Regent\u0027s Park in London on a sunny day this morning          Dog walkers enjoy the sunshine as a beautiful morning greets Londoners at Regent\u0027s Park todayMaximum temperatures recorded over the weekend were 79.3F (26.3C) on Sunday, and 74.7F (23.7C) on Saturday.

Since then they have been to watch a Toronto Blue Jays baseball match together, holidayed in Italy and Meghan has taught Jessica\u0027s daughter to dance.\u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle said. \u0027Meghan adores Jessica, not just as a friend but also as someone whose taste and style are impeccable. Meghan looks up to Jessica and has, to a certain degree, modelled herself on her.\u0027     Jessica is Meghan\u0027s best friend and will be there when she marries Harry at Windsor Castle on May 19. Meghan is known to lean on her best friend for style and fashion advice          Jessica\u0027s pictures give a revealing insight into the fun nature of their friendship including the time when Meghan invited her backstage on Suits where she looks through wedding dresses          Meghan Markle is reportedly set to wear a Ralph and Russo gown (not pictured)  when she walks down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor on May 19Unlike Meghan, the former Jessica Brownstein, came from a privileged background as a member of Canada\u0027s Browns shoes dynasty, which is worth a reported £50 million.She attended an exclusive all-girls\u0027 school, before going to McGill University, where she studied industrial relations and economics. She then launched her own business importing luxury lingerie.After a successful career as a stylist – with her own TV slot – and wedding planner, she was propelled to the A list in 2008 after marrying the eldest son of Brian Mulroney.The couple has three children: twins Brian and John, now seven, and daughter Ivy now four, who are rumoured to be page boys and flower girl at the Royal wedding.Jessica and Meghan bonded over their shared passion for yoga, Pilates, dogs and philanthropy. They are so close that she has been dubbed \u0027Meghan\u0027s girl Friday\u0027 - Meghan describes herself as \u0027Aunty Meg\u0027 to her three children.           The girls enjoy the picturesque view from their hotel room on the trip          \u0027Cocktail o\u0027clock\u0027 wrote Jessica on this photo of the spread the two women enjoyed in Positano          Breakfast is served: A look at the stunning view from the hotel where the two women stayed on the trip           Jessica is so close to Royal bride-to-be Meghan that she even posted this adorable snap of the Suits star teaching her young daughter to tap dance along with the caption: \u0027Ladies Night\u0027          Jessica and Meghan bonded over their shared passion for yoga, Pilates, dogs and philanthropy.

She wore a coat by Canadian designer Sentaler and people went crazy for it. We had created this media frenzy, like you see with anything Kate wears.\u0027But it was only after Meghan began dating Prince Harry in 2016 that Mulroney became a global name. It was in her house that the couple sought refuge when news of their relationship broke.Then, last September, as speculation of an engagement reached fever pitch, Mulroney was in a box with Meghan, her mother Doria, and Markus Anderson, for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games.Harry joined them for the final 20 minutes of the show, standing arm in arm with Meghan and planting a kiss on her check as they watched Bryan Adams sing love songs.And, when Harry and Meghan got engaged last November, Mulroney was credited with orchestrating the outfit – a white wrap coat by The Line, PAROSH green dress and Aquazzura nude pumps.She is also believed to be the brains behind Meghan\u0027s outfits for many of her official engagements and is instrumental in helping her choose her wedding dress.    The relaxed snaps are a far cry from Meghan\u0027s polished appearances with Harry, such as the Anzac Day Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey last month  The candid photos show just how close the women are as Jessica and Meghan spend time away from the spotlight on holiday  A source close to Maghan has revealed how the friendship has blossomed since their time together in Toronto.  \u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle saidThe couple had a dress rehearsal on Suits when Jessica helped her choose the Anne Barge Versailles dress from Jessica\u0027s Kleinfeld Canada bridal boutique when her Suits character Rachel Zane was supposed to marry Mike Ross - only for him to leave her at the altar.She flew to London in January to attend the first fitting and was in London in April when Meghan had her final fitting. Mulroney jetted into Heathrow for a \u0027mini hen party\u0027 and was given a sneak preview of the dress and the wedding venue.She has been so successful in helping Meghan create her \u0027effortless chic\u0027 style that Vogue, editor Edward Enninful believes she could eclipse the Duchess of Cambridge. \u0027Ms Markle is an astonishing fashion sales force, who is setting the industry alight,\u0027 he said recently.A royal source said: \u0027Jessica is Meghan\u0027s BFF (best friend forever) and has been a huge influence. Meghan\u0027s turned to her for advice on everything from the dress, the flowers, decorations in church, the wedding lunch — and even the seating plan. \u0027Although Jess lives in Toronto, the two are on the phone all the time. Meg wanted Jess at the final fitting as it\u0027ll be the most famous dress of the year and she\u0027s quite nervous about it. It all went really well and they were delighted with the result.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/14/4BFA194F00000578-0-image-m-24_1525786891024.jpg","title":"Iron workers unphased staggering height 55th floor Comcast building","story":"A group brave iron-workers clearly don\u0027t fear tall heights as they stand from the 55th floor of the Comcast building in Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaWith the city\u0027s vast landscape sits in the backdrop, the iron-workers seem focused on getting their work done.Walmart sparks fury for forcing a Vietnam veteran, 69, to...‘Who the f*** would have a race summit before the...Share this articleAll of the men working appear to be tethered to the structure.

The usual suspects were there – those who spoke on the duke\u0027s little rebellion included that interminable Euro-groupie and former diplomat Lord Hannay, and his fellow crossbencher Lord Butler, once cabinet secretary. There may have been many more who voted when the House ided, but the actual debate was under-attended.Most peers know where they stand on Brexit, and it is not on the side of the majority who voted in the 2016 referendum. They were elsewhere on the parliamentary estate yesterday. I bet the bars were doing brisk business.           He helped bring about another defeat for Theresa May (pictured) and her ministers. And usAnd so we come to the Duke of Wellington, nominally a follower of the Tory Whip but, on this issue, happy to ignore his political affiliation in favour of his apparently stronger loyalty to the European Elite Party.I merely note that his duchess, Antonia, is a Princess of Prussia. He himself, Charles Valerian Wellesley OBE, DL, with more titles than a champion boxer, after schooling at Eton, has had a business career, home and abroad.He is a member of Portugal\u0027s Order of Merit and he holds the Grand Cross of the Spanish Order of Isobel the Catholic. Ole!          The first Duke of Wellington (pictured) was a tremendous thumper of the French, the victor of Waterloo, later prime minister Where once his illustrious forebear wore battle colours and carried a riding crop, this silk-suited patrician, purring in a voice that was pure gin and French, put it to their lordships that he was merely \u0027trying to help the Government and not in any way to thwart\u0027 Brexit. Noo noo, of course not. Dear heart, the thought never crossed our minds.He argued simply that it was a frightful bind for ministers to have to work with the burden of this set date for our departure. How much more they could achieve if that date were not there!Lord Butler, from what I could understand, sought to suggest that dropping the date might actually allow Brexit to be delayed for ever, but the duke did not want to pursue that idea.Eurosceptic opposition came from Lord Grocott, a Labour peer who has had to put up with some pretty bad heckling in recent months (his party colleagues at the far end of the Palace of Westminster hate him for siding with the voters).He recalled Parkinson\u0027s Law, which states that \u0027work expands to fill the time available\u0027 and he suspected that the Europhiles were merely attempting to hold up Brexit. His voice went unheeded and the duke\u0027s dismal little delay was approved by a House that, with every day, looks riper for the abattoir.Does this sort of thing help the Remainers? To have an hereditary peer, one of the most blue of all blue-bloods, helping their cause? I suspect not. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/10/4C02352300000578-5706901-image-a-1_1525856871568.jpg","title":"Hawkings family offers lottery Westminster tickets","story":"The family of the late Stephen Hawkin have announced they will hold a lottery to give 1,000 people the chance to attend a memorial service for the renowned physicist at Westminster Abbey in London where his ashes will be interred between the graves of Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin.

Cambridge is the only university in Britain to publicly display class lists after Oxford abolished them in 2009. Pictured: The Senate House and Kings College (left)Class lists are currently posted on notice boards outside Senate House, published in the Cambridge University Reporter, and are also published online.In the vote, 412 members of Regent House voted in favour, with 391 against, it was revealed today in Varsity, the university\u0027s in-house newspaper.Graham Virgo, pro-vice-chancellor for education said: \u0027I welcome the result of the ballot which means that all students are now able to choose to opt out from having their names published outside the Senate House or in the Reporter.\u0027This opt out will be implemented immediately.

Most of the 12 pieces in her first collection explore the pains, pleasures and sadnesses of middle-class, mainly American lives. They are ironic, often comical, and predominantly realist in their methods. This is an urban and suburban landscape of frustrated, middle-aged college graduates and not‑entirely-happy marriages that readers of literary fiction will certainly have encountered before. Nevertheless, while some stories fall flat, others find ways to be pleasantly, or not so pleasantly, surprising.The collection opens in impressive style. “The Standing Chandelier”, a novella set in Lexington, Virginia, traces the history, development and painful finale of a 24-year friendship between Jillian Frisk, an amateur artist and free spirit, and Weston Babansky, her confidant and tri-weekly tennis partner. As the narrative gradually unfolds, Shriver moves the point of view back and forth between Jillian and Weston, giving us access to the different ways they make sense of themselves and their enjoyably haphazard lives. The reader comes to understand, in painful and entirely convincing detail, the ways in which they begin to move apart. The story’s themes – the loss of a certain kind of innocence, the need, however long‑delayed, to give up childish things – are not new, of course, but Shriver finds a way to make them fresh and powerful.Almost equally successful is “Kilifi Creek”, first published in the New Yorker, which begins in Kenya with the protagonist Liana, a freeloading college student from Wisconsin, paying an uninvited visit to some semi-retired friends of friends, the Henleys. Shriver is excellent at capturing the presumptions and arrogance of youth, and the story’s omniscient narrator neatly skewers Liana’s vague but maddening sense of entitlement as she quickly makes herself at home in someone else’s house. Had Liana needed further rationalisation of her amiable freeloading, she might also have reasoned that in Kenya every white household was overrun with underemployed servants … So Liana’s impromptu visit would provide the domestics with something to do.It is to Shriver’s credit that she doesn’t just leave things there. The narrative voice is capacious enough to see that Liana’s sins are not particular to her: they are the sins of youthfulness, and so will pass in time. The story seems to be going in a particular direction, but then cleverly shifts and finds a different, altogether bolder and wiser way to end.Since her controversial keynote address at the Brisbane writers festival in 2016, where she attacked the censoriousness of the cultural left, Shriver has become known as much for her libertarian and anti-PC brand of politics as for her award-winning fiction. None of the stories collected in Property could be described as overtly or straightforwardly political: the settings and themes are almost all domestic. There are, however, some moments when more liberal readers might feel their hackles beginning to rise.In “Domestic Terrorism”, for example, Liam, Harriet and Court’s 32-year-old son, is a model of inert neediness. His refusal to get a job and move out of their Atlanta home is persistently compared to the efforts of refugees from Africa and the Middle East to get to Europe. “Weakness was a weapon, and a fiendishly effective one,” Harriet thinks, halfway through the story, nearly at her wits’ end due to Liam’s lack of gumption. “The moment those poor migrants set one foot on Greek sand they ceased to be an African and Syrian problem and transformed into a European one. The temptation to pole those populous dinghies from the shore must have been stupendous.” The comparison is provocative but also ambiguous. Is the refugee crisis being offered as a comic metaphor for Harriet’s difficulties with Liam? Or is Liam’s infuriating shiftlessness being offered as a rather less comic metaphor for the refugee crisis? Is Liam a little like a refugee, or are refugees a lot like Liam? The difference, although subtle, is morally crucial, and it is to the story’s detriment, in the end, that it seems to want to hedge its bets and keep both possibilities alive.The title of the collection, Property, reflects the fact that many of the stories are concerned with houses and the psychology of home ownership. An equally fitting one might have been Resentment, since this is the most frequent emotional note. We see children resenting parents, parents resenting children, insiders resenting outsiders, and outsiders resenting each other. Shriver is an astute observer of such feelings, alive to their variety and complexity. When the stories explore the workings of resentment from a judicious distance, and treat it with a dose of irony, they generally succeed, but when, as in the case of “Domestic Terrorism”, they get in too close, and risk becoming resentful themselves, the results can be less admirable.• Property is published by HarperCollins.

Sky, which operates in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy, has 23 million.The deal excludes Liberty Global’s joint venture with Vodafone in the Netherlands, VodafoneZiggo, and Virgin Media in the UK. The potential benefits of a tie-up of the UK’s biggest cable operator with the largest commercial, free-to-air broadcaster was spotted more than a decade ago when NTL Telewest – before a rebrand to Virgin Media – held merger talks. “The use of proceeds from the sale will be determined in due course and are expected to provide significant additional flexibility to optimise growth and shareholder returns,” Liberty Global said.Mike Fries, the chief executive of Liberty Global, said the deal was necessary as in some markets such as Germany, which is dominated by Deutsche Telekom, there is a lack of competition.“Now more than ever, Europe needs strong competition from scaled national challengers willing and able to invest in next-generation wireless, video and broadband services,” he said. “Germany, for example, is dominated by one provider that controls over half the broadband market. Even together, Liberty Global and Vodafone, whose cable networks do not compete or overlap, will be half the size of the incumbent operator. It’s time to alter market dynamics by unleashing greater investment and competition.”A break fee of €250m will be payable by Vodafone, in certain circumstances, if the deal does not complete."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62e2ca479819d3ee77f6e9dcb3a8bf0b30914d34/0_279_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7c6274f6c7bc45ffc047f67d2fcbee99 1240w","title":"shopping centre currency hope newcastle under lyme","story":"Commerce has deserted Newcastle-under-Lyme’s town centre. The latest in our new economics series looks at how the community is filling the gap • Listen to Aditya Chakrabortty talking about game-changing economic models on The Alternatives podcastFor years, all Mike Riddell has seen in his trade is failure and death. But today he’s at a birth – and all his hope rests on it. A new cafe is opening in the shopping centre he manages and they are throwing a party. Having brought along his wife and mum, 53-year-old Riddell goes into “full-on host mode”, chatting up council officials and swapping elaborate handshakes with teenagers. Yes Sir, I Can Boogie blasts out of the stereo, and some obliging soul in a Spider-Man costume complies. Over all the music and chat, you can hear the free ping-pong tables getting a pounding. Yes sir, clip-clop, clip-clop, I can boogie, clip-clop, clip-clop.Through the big windows, you can see the world Riddell normally faces – and it’s desolate. No babble, no mucking about. Hardly anyone clip-clops past. On this Tuesday lunchtime at York Place, the most tired shopping centre in Newcastle-under-Lyme, just outside Stoke, there are few actual shoppers.After decades building and running shopping centres across the country, Riddell has looked after York Place for two tough years. He let out this same entrance cafe to a can-do pair at the end of 2017. They lasted a few months before giving up, leaving behind the tables, chairs and a stove for whoever else wanted to try their luck. It would be hard for anyone, but especially for Riddell, who is one of life’s enthusiasts. He zooms down conversational detours about his great love, northern soul, and its debt to miners’ culture. And he never wears a poker face. Ask how important this successor cafe is and he admits: “Fucking vital. We need to make this work.”At rock bottom, eight of York Place’s 35 units stood vacant. Still today, bare shopfronts are as obvious as missing teeth. Next door at the fancier Roebuck Centre, the Early Learning Centre, Argos and Primark have all disappeared. Even the charity shops are vanishing. For centuries, Newcastle, as locals call it, has been a bustling market town. Today the market is retreating and the town’s very identity is under threat.York Place is at the eye of a storm that has either already hit your home town or is looming over it. Last year 5,855 shops closed in Britain, the most since 2010. If today is in line with the average, by this evening a net total of five shops will have given up the ghost.In our long post-crash slump, trusted names are either shutting down or cutting back: Woolworths, Comet, Blockbuster, Maplin, Jaeger, Toys R Us, BHS... As British wages continue to flatline, more closures will follow. Just last week, the 169-year-old chain House of Fraser announced plans to begin insolvency proceedings .These inidual business failures amount collectively to a disease eating away at small-town centres and suburban high streets. It advances in stages: first out are the brand names and chains then shoppers with cars after that, in come the charity shops and betting dens. What’s left are ghost towns, abandoned by all bar schoolchildren and pensioners.“Walk around Newcastle at three in the afternoon and a lot of the cafes are empty,” says Andy Arnott, a senior local council officer. “Come five, everybody finishes work and leaves town.”I can see why a retailer already battling Lidl or Amazon’s Jeff Bezos might pass over Newcastle. It’s a bit too close to Stoke to draw its own footfall. It lies in a region built on mining and potteries, where prosperity is now a fading memory. In a country that simply has too many shops, executives have little use for Newcastle and other places, from Dartford to Newport to Dewsbury. What, apart from shopping, will they do now? What, indeed, does a country built on debt and consumption do when it’s exhausted that model? These are questions that Westminster has barely even clocked, let alone tried to answer.David Cameron got Mary “Queen of Shops” Portas to write a report on “distressed town centres”, then so roundly ignored her proposals that she attacked his “PR campaign”. Since 2011 there have been seven high street ministers in as many years. So weighty have been their interventions, I bet you didn’t even know there was such a thing as a high street minister.Which leaves it up to towns to fix their own gutted centres, using whatever tools they can find. Dumfries has a “doon toon army” of locals bidding to buy derelict shops. In Newcastle, Riddell and his colleagues already have a plan. They’re turning York Place into a post-shopping centre.Its anchor tenant – the big shop to draw in passing trade – isn’t an H\u0026ampM or a Wilko, but a charity: the YMCA. Rather than a traditional charity shop, it’s selling jewellery and other work hand-made by local artists, and runs arts and crafts workshops for residents of all ages. And as of last Tuesday, the cornerstone cafe is Cultural Squatters, a social enterprise that markets itself as the “anti-Costa”. It serves instant coffee at £1 a mug alongside those Staffordshire specialities, lobby (stew) and oatcakes. Staff include adult volunteers with learning disabilities.Where shopping centres are normally stuffed full of chains, York Place is now a hub for local independents. Where landlords usually demand maximum rent, Riddell has cajoled his London-based client into accepting two non-profits in return for reduced business rates.It’s a pragmatic way of reclaiming commercial space for a community – and it’s buttressed by a reward scheme launched by Riddell and his colleagues at Manchester-based consultancy HometownPlus. Called CounterCoin, it’s like a Tesco Clubcard – except you earn points not by spending, but by doing something for the community. Help out at a YMCA workshop, say, and you’ll get clay tokens that entitle you to bargain off-peak sessions at the neighbourhood bowling alley, or discounts from the local Spar on food about to pass its best-before date. “If we can dole out points for being a zombie consumer at Tesco, why can’t we give points for doing some good in the community?” says Riddell.“Genius,” says Arnott, who plans to add more of the council’s leisure facilities to the scheme.Again, this is commonsense radicalism: retrieving things discarded by the market, whether shops or goods or people, and giving them a social value.That’s true of the abandoned plot now occupied by Cultural Squatters. It’s also true of its founder, Narina Stead, who fixed up her cafe despite a broken arm and torn ligaments. Painting hurt, she admits, but “I’m too busy for a sling”.Has you or your community come up with answers to doing things differently?

Another relationship broke her mental health, forcing her out of work and on to benefits. She used the time to get a first-class English degree, then “boshed out” a master’s, finishing both in three years. Yet in a jobs market as slack as north Staffordshire, it would be an unusual employer who would bother looking past her long-term unemployment to see her brains and stamina. What about the state? A couple of months ago, it was chasing her for bedroom tax. Only Riddell offered her a shot at a business. It’s hard graft that has still to pay, but when she blurts out “This is my baby!”, her pride needs no underlining.Pinned to the noticeboard of the York Place offices are not charts of till receipts or footfall – but a graph depicting how many person-hours have been poured into the local community through the shopping centre. However crude, it’s an attempt to measure social value, and I’ll bet 10 CounterCoin that no other mall anywhere in the country charts such a thing.“It’s no ordinary shopping centre. It’s a laboratory,” says Julie Froud, a professor at Alliance Manchester Business School, who is conducting an independent evaluation of York Place.It lacks investment, as shown by the cluster of buckets to catch leaks in the entrance. The ideas are rough around the edges, and many of those involved are working on goodwill. But at least the centre only has one faraway landlord activists in Dumfries are having to barter with a number of absentee owners.In this lies a lesson for any opposition party that wants to offer disaffected voters a means of taking back control: make it easier for communities to repossess derelict properties. Most of all, Froud notes: “This is a group of people all trying to make things happen.”And trying to change a broken model. It’s often assumed that this hyper-consumerist culture of debt and spending is intrinsically British – yet it is a recent invention. As late as the 1960s, the historian Frank Trentmann notes in his 2016 book Empire of Things, furniture bought on hire purchase would be delivered in “plain vans” so as to not to shame a family. Then, between the mid-70s and the mid-90s, the number of Britons with credit facilities tripled.With that began the giant boom for the shopping business – including for Riddell, who built malls from Newport to Crewe. He drives me to see one of his last shopping malls, the Grand Arcade in Wigan. It opened in March 2007, “pretty much the same day as Warrington, only 20 miles away, had a massive extension to its shopping centre. The Trafford centre had just had one too. Preston, Chorley – they were all at the same game.”Then Britain’s credit system failed. “The banks were like, ‘That umbrella we lent you when it was sunny, can we have it back now it’s raining?’ We had a shopping centre in Wakefield half-built, and the banks stopped the funding.”Since the company’s huge loans were backed by the partners, Riddell had to hold his own closing-down sale and liquidate almost everything he owned. He went from being worth millions to being tens of millions in debt. The family home was only saved by cash from his father-in-law. He also donated the nine-year-old car we’re now in.“Those bastards in the banking system” are, in his eyes, “drug dealers. They want to get their cocaine out, and they’re bonused up to find people like us. ‘Here, d’you want more stuff?’ Then when the drugs ran out, they came and kicked our doors in and scared our wives.”Now he holds no bank account, and buys precious little. Having been spat out of the debt-consumerist complex, he wants nothing more to do with it.As we park up outside his glory days, he sighs: “Weird, being back here.” The Grand Arcade was built on the site of the Wigan Casino, and there is by the vast cafe a shrine to northern soul: guitars, posters and seven-inch singles.Still, he remembers, local traders hated the mall for sucking the life out of the local high street. Now it has its own voids: both TK Maxx and Monsoon have left. Riddell takes a long, mystified look at the temple he built, deserted at closing time.“Retail,” he finally says. “It’s dead, innit?”• Aditya Chakrabortty is senior economics commentator for the "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may portrait students","story":"Free speech rows at universities have become central to the recent culture war: an easy way to lambast snowflaky students, the latest thing to induce eye-rolling and groans about “political correctness gone mad”. The most recent involves Theresa May, whose portrait was moved from the attic in which it has been mysteriously degrading to be included in a display of famous female geography alumnae at Oxford’s school of geography and the environment.Students then stuck messages around the painting arguing that, as Brexit trundles on and the Windrush scandal continues, the prime minister’s image went against the ersity and inclusivity that the school – and geography as a subject – should stand for. Academics also argued that an institution with an intellectual responsibility to hold power to account should not be honouring a head of state in this way.The portrait was removed for its own safety, but may be reinstated – all in a dizzying cyclone of denouncements and counter-denouncements on social media, a hashtag (#NotAllGeographers, naturally), and a pushback from Tory politicians. “Even portraits are being no-platformed”, tweeted the universities minister, Sam Gyimah, who declared the row “utterly ridiculous”.I doubt many people are preoccupying themselves with whether a picture of Theresa May should be displayed on a wall of an elitist academic institution, the inside of which most of us are unlikely to ever see. I suspect the only reason these Tory politicians care is that so many of them went there, and feeling rejected by the institution that primed them for power feels like a slap in the face.But what I am interested in is why these rows gain so much traction now – what is it about the times we live in that this story is making the news? (And yes, I recognise the irony in the fact that I am writing about this now). Because the thing is, students and academics have been having slightly tedious rows about the relative merits of displaying, inviting, funding or discussing – insert literally anything here – for years. They were certainly doing it when I was there indeed, it’s one of the main reasons many avoided student politics, and they were definitely doing it in the 1970s.It’s partly what universities are for, this revising and unpicking and interrogating of history and politics. Even if people such as myself would rather stay in bed than listen to it, most students recognise it as part and parcel of the university experience. Does it even count as an institute of higher education if there isn’t some kind of boycott or strike or occupation going on?Couple that with the fact that humanities subjects have long included the study of colonialism and its legacies in their syllabuses, and you do wonder what has changed to make this suddenly so controversial. As we reflect on the 50 years since the student uprisings in May 1968, I don’t think students are more radical today than they ever were. This portrait was not torn down or even defaced with a Hitler moustache – a direction certain writers might have once been inclined to follow instead it was surrounded by polite messages written on multicoloured bits of paper. Letters were written, hashtags were tweeted, and people acknowledged that having a female prime minister – the second only in history – is worthy of note despite other objections. These are hardly credible threats to establishment power. So why does the establishment care?One reason is, I imagine, the imperialism to which the students object. If you think that there aren’t people in government and the media today, in 2018, who believe the British empire was A Good Thing, then you are kidding yourself. Students are better aware of race issues, too, and more vocal about them. These underrepresented voices are amplified by social media.But the biggest factor in all this, I believe, is simple ageism. At a time when intergenerational injustice is rife, and the debate about what is fair and what isn’t becomes fraught, some will take any opportunity to take potshots at 21-year-old “snowflakes”.Universities are easy pickings, with kids challenging their elders all over the shop. And with many other industries and institutions top-heavy with baby boomers unwilling to make room for new blood, perhaps there are few opportunities to see what youngsters are up to. In fact, perhaps boredom and fear of cultural stagnation has led to this sudden attention. Perhaps, in a funny way, it’s something of a compliment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e173187867150d2fc9f023073161a44bfc94904/0_0_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5cb39826df4fc9f74c27002c02c9bef","title":"tories southern red south england london","story":"More than 1 million people moved out of London over the last four years – and three-quarters of those people now live in the south of England.

People leaving London are setting up home across the south in their hundreds of thousands, and as a result changing the composition of both London and the south. Now we at Election Data are examining the demographic trends more deeply, with a poll of ex-Londoners’ voting behaviours.Meanwhile, London continues to suck in young students, graduates and twentysomethings from across the country. (Nearly 750,000 people have arrived in the capital over the past four years.) This means a net inflow of these younger, better-educated voters – so London gets younger and younger, while outlying towns, within commuting distance of the capital, see a large influx from London. In effect, London is attracting better-educated young people, who in time are deposited back into commuter-belt towns surrounding the metropolis. The political effects of these significant patterns can be seen in elections since 2015.Across the south, places including Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Reading, Windsor and Maidenhead, Wokingham, High Wycombe, Winchester, Tunbridge Wells, Oxfordshire, Epsom, Guildford, Cheltenham, Exeter, Brighton, Bristol, Bath and Stroud – many of the destinations of choice for Londoners – voted in 2016 to remain in the European Union.In the 2017 general election, not only did the Conservatives lose seats in Brighton, Bedford, Canterbury, Ipswich, Stroud, Eastbourne, Peterborough, Reading and Oxford – but many seats across the south saw a swing from the Conservatives to Labour.Since the general election there have been more than 600 local byelections in councils across Britain.In the south of England the Conservatives have been suffering:In the local elections last week, the Conservatives lost control of Mole Valley, Plymouth, Kingston-upon-Thames, and South Cambridgeshire, while also losing vote share in wards across the region. So at the same time as the development of significant migration patterns, the political makeup of the south has changed. The obvious question is: are the two events related? One way to find out would be to ask those people who have left London how they have voted in recent general elections and the European referendum.Historically speaking, you might have expected these voters to be much more Conservative. Many can be described as affluent young families with suburban mindsets. Seven in 10 are ABC1 social grade. However, over the last two years they have moved from supporting the Conservatives, then the remain side in the European referendum, and now Labour.Slowly but surely, parts of the south of England are becoming a little bit more like London. If these trends continue we can expect the south’s political makeup to become more like London too. The results of recent elections bear this out, and this polling shows us why.• Ian Warren is director of the consultancy Election Data• This article was co-written with Chris Curtis"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbef697e34dedc54462e330acf86d5a59184a703/0_173_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f08e6df0c704d747db83e5816e76c69","title":"poutine and beyond 10 local eats you have to try when youre in canada","story":" The revered combo of chips, gravy and cheese curd is arguably Canada’s national food – even McDonald’s serves it. But there are dozens of other regional delicacies to be found across the country. From sweet treats to edible ferns, here are 10 to get your teeth stuck intoFrom Vancouver’s deserved reputation for incredible Asian fare to the hearty variation on French peasant food found in Quebec, Canada’s cuisine reflects its enviable confluence of cultures. Diversity here is not just an abstract concept – it is something you can taste, from unlikely imported favourites like Ukrainian pierogi dumplings and Jewish deli-style smoked-meat sandwiches to home-grown poutine.Nanaimo barsThese decadent sweet treats consist of a chocolate crumb base covered in custard-flavoured butter icing and topped with a layer of chocolate. Different places do different versions, and often deviate from the original recipe (known as the classic), with everything from nuts to coconut to peanut butter thrown in. You’ll see Nanaimo bars in bakeries across Canada but, as the name suggests, they originated in Nanaimo, a small city on Vancouver Island. Visit there and you’ll find multitudinous interpretations of this much-loved treat. There’s even a 39-stop Nanaimo bar trail where you can sample Nanaimo bar martinis, cupcakes, waffles and spring rolls, and get a themed pedicure at a local spa. Halifax donairWhen you see your first Halifax donair you may wonder why this is considered special – after all, it looks like the same late-night doner kebab that is served in cities the world over – but there’s a delicious twist that makes it unique. A Halifax donair comes served with a sweet garlic sauce that resembles runny icing, and is unbelievably delicious. The sauce is made up of evaporated milk, garlic powder, vinegar, and sugar, and is what gives these kebabs their cult following. In recent years they’ve gone a bit gourmet, and you’ll find them served in other major Canadian cities – but always listed as a Halifax donair. You should absolutely try one, even if sober.FiddleheadsEvery spring you’ll see fiddleheads on the menus of high-end restaurants and at farmers’ markets across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Fiddleheads, the curly, edible shoots of the ostrich fern, are usually foraged along marshy riverbanks and woodlands. Like so many regional delicacies, they are an acquired taste, but their flavour varies greatly depending on how they are prepared.BeavertailsThese massive flat doughnuts originated in Ottawa back in 1978, and are found sold at Beavertails stands and stores across Canada. Served regular, Beavertails come sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, but there’s a whole range of toppings from chocolate banana or apple cinnamon to hazelnut, maple and more. All are, of course, delicious, and are especially tasty when eaten on a cold day with a cup of hot chocolate. PoutineThis combination of fries and cheese curd smothered in gravy is a Québec classic that you’ll find served throughout the country – it’s even on the menu at McDonald’s outlets across Canada. So it won’t be hard for you to try some version of this very Canadian street food. And once you’ve navigated the classic, explore the variations: many restaurants in Nova Scotia serve lobster poutine (which is amazing), and there are plenty of places in Québec – such as La Banquise in Montreal – that have entire poutine menus, where the toppings include everything from roast chicken, peas and stuffing to smoked beef brisket.Cod tongueAs unappetising as they sound, cod tongues – served pan-fried with scrunchions (bite-sized fresh pork scratchings) – are delicious and tender. Like lobster, cod tongues used to be considered a poor man’s food, but now you’ll find them on menus at fancy restaurants up and down Canada’s east coast, often listed as a starter.Butter tartThe ridiculously rich butter tart is a Canadian staple. The consistency and taste is somewhat similar to a treacle tart, but not quite, and the topic of whether or not butter tarts should contain raisins is rather controversial. You’ll find butter tarts everywhere, from the fanciest bakeries to gas stations in middle of nowhere, but if you want to experience the best of the best, head to Ontario’s Best Butter Tart Festival, held every June in Midland, Ontario.PierogiThere’s a huge Ukranian population in the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so it’s no surprise that pierogis are a big thing there. These tasty little dumplings traditionally come stuffed with meat or cheese and potato, but now you’ll find them stuffed with everything from blueberries to caramelised onions, because pierogi have gone upmarket. You’ll find pierogi food trucks and high-end restaurants doing them in interesting ways across Canada. If you’d prefer to go old school, look for homely pierogi joints when visiting Winnipeg or Saskatoon (which even has a pierogi drive-through, Baba’s).BannockThis flash-fried bread resembles a doughnut, and has long been a staple in the diet of some of Canada’s indiginous communities, who produced their own variation by baking a wild plant called camas, before European settlers introduced wheat flour in the 17th century. You’ll see it served at traditional restaurants – or if you visit a reservation while in Canada – but also on the menus of fine-dining restaurants (sometimes served as a starter or in place of bread, and often with a ramekin some delicious thing to slather it with). Extremely moreish.Montreal smoked-meat sandwichesThe meat in one of these epic sandwiches is brined, spiced and smoked brisket. This comes piled high in sliced rye bread and spread with mustard, and is a carnivore’s dream. Schwartz’s Deli in Montreal is one of the best places to find an authentic sandwich (which comes with fries and a pickle) and the real Jewish deli experience – it has been using the same recipe since 1928 and the interior doesn’t look like it’s changed much in decades. If the queues at Schwartz’s look daunting, then cross the street and join the locals at the Main Deli Steak House. It’s where Montreal-born Leonard Cohen would get his fix whenever he returned home.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22422f16834b36234675605d408b0866db16d6e8/0_215_4242_2545/master/4242.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b3471dbd47a235441821b5dcb631aed","title":"secret uk push to weaken eu climate laws completely mad","story":"Plan to change timeline for energy use reduction puts Paris targets at risk, say MEPS A secret UK push to weaken key EU climate laws before Brexit risks scotching the bloc’s Paris commitments, MEPs say.But leaked documents seen by the  show that Britain is pushing for its 2014-2020 timeline to be stretched backwards four years to count “early actions” taken that comply with the efficiency directive. Any “excess energy savings” during the law’s writ would then be forwarded to the post-2020 period. MEPs have branded the plan “incomprehensible”. “This approach would risk failure in our efforts to reach even moderately ambitious overall targets, while the higher – and beneficial targets – that we need to strive for could become lost altogether.”Jávor added that it was “rude” for the UK to weaken climate measures that it would only be bound by during a transition period, before it left the bloc. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade and climate spokesman, said: “2018 is the year when countries have been asked by the UN to ratchet up their commitments on climate change. Instead our government is actually proposing to count emissions savings made from as far back as 2010 towards fulfilling their obligations in the next decade from 2021-2030.”“This sneaky, behind-the-scenes amendment indicates a government that likes to pretend it is a global leader but will not take the strong policy action needed to deliver the necessary change.”A UK government spokesperson said: “We are asking for clarity on certain energy savings between 2010 and 2013 and agreeing these for the 2020 target. This is not about applying these energy savings post-2020. To suggest otherwise is incorrect and we continue to advocate ambitious future targets.”Any “excess energy savings” between 2014 and 2020 “may count towards the fulfilment of obligations between 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030”, it says.The UK tried but failed to have similar loopholes added to the original directive in 2012. The Liberal-Democrat MEP, Catherine Bearder said it “gave the lie” to Michael Gove’s claims to be leading a “green revolution”. “One despairs,” she said. “In the face of Brexit, we really don’t have a leg to stand on. We’re in no position to start issuing demands. This is a carefully crafted agreement to decrease our carbon emissions and make our energy use more efficient. It is disappointing and ludicrous that we would come forward trying to water that down as we head towards the EU’s exit door.”  Europe is expected to easily achieve this, although its CO2 emissions appear to be rising as economic activity picks up, while energy efficiency gains have gone into reverse. Almost all UK environmental policy currently derives from EU law and the union’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has insisted that a ‘non-regression article’ be included in any final EU-UK agreement to prevent backsliding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f915ef8fd0c22ff7af07eb6390b8038180c415a1/0_117_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fffdf28b33c841ece467e3c9bc4b5d44","title":"south georgia declared rat free centuries rodent devastation","story":"World’s biggest project to kill off invasive species to protect native wildlife is hailed a successThe world’s biggest project to eradicate a dangerous invasive species has been declared a success, as the remote island of South Georgia is now clear of the rats and mice that had devastated its wildlife for nearly 250 years.Rats and mice were inadvertently introduced to the island, off the southern tip of South America and close to Antarctica, by ships that stopped there, usually on whaling expeditions. The effect on native bird populations was dramatic. Unused to predators, they laid their eggs on the ground or in burrows, easily accessible to the rodents.Two species of birds unique to the island, the South Georgia pipit and pintail, were largely confined to a few tiny islands off the coast, which the rodents could not reach, and penguins and other seabird populations were also threatened.The last of the poisoned bait was dropped more than two years ago, but scientists have spent the intervening period monitoring the island for rodents. Two experienced dog handlers from New Zealand walked three dogs – named Will, Ahu and Wai – across nearly 1,550 miles (2,500km) in often extreme weather, beset by heavy rain and often fierce storms, seeking out signs of rats and mice.Only when none were found over the whole period and in every area was the project deemed a success according to international standards. The leaders of the eradication effort declared the island free of rats and mice on Wednesday, and said the air resounded with the once-rare song of the native pipit.The project was led by the South Georgia Heritage Trust, a charity set up to protect the island, and an associate organisation, the US-based Friends of South Georgia Island. The UK government also played a role, but the bulk of the funding came from private fundraising and philanthropy.Scientists hope the success could become an inspiration and model for other projects around the world to eliminate invasive species, which in the worst cases can drive native animals close to extinction.The South Georgia programme involved dropping hundreds of tonnes of poisoned bait on areas known to be infested with rodents. Harsh weather, mountainous terrain and the island’s limited accessibility made the project fraught with danger.At times, when scientists believed they had eradicated rats from one area, they returned from another nearby section of the island, meaning the poisoning regime had to begin again. Richardson paid tribute to the teams’ endurance and bravery.South Georgia, one of the UK’s numerous overseas territories, was first noted by Captain Cook in 1775 on one of his voyages of discovery. It became a stop for the hundreds of whalers which plied the southern seas, providing shelter, dry land and a meeting site for ships that may have spent weeks or months without sight of land. About 2,000 people lived on the island during whaling’s heyday, but today the main activities are centred on two scientific research stations run by the British Antarctic Survey. It was claimed for Argentina during the Falklands war, and a UK garrison was only withdrawn in 2001. The island is also known as the burial ground of the Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton, who died there in 1922.About 100 miles long, the island covers about 350,000 hectares (865,000 acres) and much of it is covered in snow and ice. The remainder is very mountainous. Some of the coastal regions have vegetation, which has provided a haven for seabirds, and the pipits and pintails.Invasive species are one of the worst threats to bioersity around the world. When non-native species are introduced, often inadvertently but also sometimes as pets or ornamental features, they can disrupt natural ecosystems evolved over millennia to the detriment of the native species. One classic example is the grey squirrel, introduced to Europe as a novelty and which has come close to eclipsing the native red in the UK. It was thought this was mainly because the more aggressive greys outcompeted the reds for habitats and food, but more recently scientists have discovered that a virus called squirrelpox, to which the natives have little resistance, also played a leading role."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/584dfe3c8bc3fa0ebc7ba822282b00d08dd426b2/1756_0_6663_4000/master/6663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b955934fe9061cb7e0d5545bdb0aae47","title":"running wild five of the best national park runs","story":"Boost your stamina by hitting a national park trail, where natural wonders will push you to new heightsLength: 4 milesTime: 50 minutesStartfinish: Loch Morlich Beach car park (OS Explorer OL57)Grade: EasyAscent: 164 feet (50 metres)Terrain: Wide gravel paths and forest trailsRefuel: Glenmore Visitor Centre cafe (PH22 1QU)Home to the highest mountains in the UK, the Cairngorms national park is known for its snowy plateaux and abundant Munros (hills over 3,000ft914 metres). But don’t let the extreme landscape put you off lacing up your trainers, as among the lofty peaks are swathes of ancient native forests and hidden lochs to explore on foot – and you won’t need to pack an ice-axe or crampons. This gentle route takes you on a clockwise circuit of Loch Morlich, a tranquil stretch of water surrounded by woodland and fringed by sandy beaches at the foot of the northern Cairngorms. For most of the waymarked route you’ll be running through open pine forest, glimpsing views of Loch Morlich and the stunning backdrop of rounded, often snow-covered mountains mirrored in its still water. The area is a haven for wildlife – it’s worth pausing to catch your breath at one of the many burns (streams) that feed the loch, for a chance to spot dippers, wagtails and herons. As you continue around the loch keep an eye out for red squirrels darting up trees and golden eagles soaring overhead. Once you’ve completed the four-mile loop, there’s always the option to finish with a bracing dip in the water at Loch Morlich beach, famous for being one of the highest in Britain.Length: 3.8 milesTime: 1 hourStartfinish: Whitesands car park (OS Explorer OL35)Grade: ModerateAscent: 392ft (119 metres)Terrain: Coastal path and heathlandRefuel: Whitesands beach cafe (SA62 6PS)Following a section of the long-distance Pembrokeshire Coast Path, this 3.8-mile circular route around St David’s Head packs plenty into its short length. And what it lacks in mileage it more than makes up for with a magnificent seascape dominated by Ramsey Island and an archipelago of rocky islands known as the Bishops and Clerks. As you follow the undulating coast path towards the rugged peninsula of St David’s Head, it’s worth looking back at the curving mile-long sandy beach of Whitesands Bay with its rolling surf breaks. Along with breathtaking coastal views and plenty of wildlife-spotting opportunities, the route passes two prehistoric monuments: Coetan Arthur, a 5,000-year-old burial chamber, and an iron age coastal fort perched at the end of the peninsula. The inland return leg takes you through wildlife-rich heathland that skirts the lower flanks of the jagged outcrop of Carn Llidi, before rejoining the coast path back to Whitesands Bay. If you’re keen to try a spot of off-road running then this is a very accessible circuit with enough punch to give your legs a bit of a test.Length: 11 milesTime: 3 hoursStartfinish: Market Cross, OsmotherleyClay Bank car park (OS Explorer OL26)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 2,460ft (750 metres)Terrain: Stone-paved moorland paths and woodland tracksRefuel: Lordstones cafe at Carlton Bank (TS9 7JH)Following a segment of the 109-mile Cleveland Way national trail across the northern escarpment of the North York Moors national park, this is a strenuous route with some thigh-burning ascents and descents. But at the top of each steep climb you will be rewarded with outstanding views across the national park and beyond: north to the distant conurbation of Teesside and south and east across an expanse of moors and dales. The waymarked route heads north out of the pretty village of Osmotherley before entering a rollercoaster landscape that crosses five undulating moors: Scarth Wood Moor, Live Moor, Cringle Moor, Cold Moor and Hasty Bank. Along the way, signs of the area’s industrial past are visible in the remains of alum, jet and ironstone mining the raw materials that were transported to Teesside during the Industrial Revolution. After a well-deserved break at Lordstones cafe, the route gets serious as it crosses the Three Sisters, a series of steep, rocky climbs with technical downhill sections including the impressive jagged sandstone crags known as the Wainstones, before a final steep descent brings you to Clay Bank. It’s not a route for the faint-hearted, but it certainly delivers when it comes to stunning moorland scenery. And the sense of achievement you feel at the end is most definitely worth it.Length: 7.3 milesTime: 2 hoursStartfinish: Heddon valley National Trust car park (OS Explorer OL9)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 1,270ft (387 metres)Terrain: Woodland track, exposed coast path and quiet roadRefuel: Hunters Inn, Heddon valley (EX31 4PY)The deep, wooded Heddon valley on the western flanks of Exmoor national park is a hidden gem for trail running, with its appealing mix of terrain, from gentle riverside paths and peaceful woodland tracks to rugged high sea cliffs and exposed moorland. And this circular route includes a healthy blend of them all. It begins in a tranquil woodland setting following an old smugglers’ path towards Heddon’s Mouth Cleave. But don’t be lulled into a false sense of “easiness” – the sting isn’t in the tail of this route, but a mere mile into the run when it climbs a steep zig-zag path to reach high sea cliffs with spectacular views across the Bristol channel to the south Wales coastline. You will need to keep your wits about you at this point as the route follows a narrow, exposed path that runs perilously close to the edge of the sheer cliffs rising more than 650ft (200 metres) above the sea below. It’s worth pausing along this coastal stretch to take in the rugged coastline, both ahead and behind you – if you’re lucky you may spot a kestrel hovering above the path or a peregrine falcon nesting in the cliff face. Veering off the coast path the route takes you across open moorland to reach its highest point at Holdstone Hill (1,145ft349 metres) before gently descending into dense oak woodland to follow Ladies’ Mile back to Hunters Inn, where you can reward yourself with a pint of local ale.Length: 10 milesTime: 3 hoursStartfinish: Cutthroat Bridge lay-by on the A57 (OS Explorer OL1)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 1,689ft (515 metres)Terrain: Moorland paths and woodland tracksRefuel: Ladybower Inn (S33 0AX)The Peak District national park can certainly deliver the goods when it comes to a bracing off-road course with stupendous views. On this 10-mile circular route, prepare yourself for some hefty climbing during the first half as you ascend to Derwent Moor and journey along the ridge of Derwent Edge, but once past the trig point at Back Tor (1,765ft538 metres) the remainder of the route is much less demanding. Your first glimpse of Ladybower reservoir, a vast Y-shaped man-made reservoir, appears as you approach Whinstone Lee Tor, and as you continue northwards along Derwent Edge, passing a number of surreal eroded granite outcrops, the views of the Peak District landscape continue to impress: east across a vast stretch of exposed moorland and west along the lush Derwent valley towards the distinctive ridge of Mam Tor, Hollins Cross and Lose Hill in the distance. The final segment is a gentle leg-stretcher along the eastern edge of the reservoir through Ladybower wood, passing through the lost village of Ashopton, which was flooded during the construction of the reservoir in 1940s. This isn’t a route for putting your head down and gunning for a personal best in fact, it’s worth easing off your pace so that you can fully enjoy the spectacular scenery.Unisex Colorado running packThis pack is ideal for long trail runs, with adjustable hip belt and chest straps.

But from Rihanna’s pope to Lena Waithe’s rainbow-flag cape, the opening night ball was a triumphIt took curator Andrew Bolton several years to convince the Vatican to give its blessing to Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, the blockbuster show at the politan Museum in New York that explores ine inspiration in fashion. One imagines Rome’s reluctance stemmed from concern that the exhibition – and particularly the opening night gala, which has become known for its outrageous outfits – would trivialise religious imagery.It needn’t have worried. Fashion takes clothes very, very seriously. In a world in which dressing up matters and sartorial symbolism carries a very real weight, the Met Gala is the most important night of the year. Even when it looks absurd to outsiders – remember the omelette dress of 2015? – the fashion seen on the Met Gala red carpet has been considered and planned with the solemnity of a papal conclave. In their Manhattan hotel rooms, celebrities dress for this event with a level of meticulous ceremony which would befit a Sunday at St Peters.This year’s dress code was a challenge. To succeed on this red carpet required honouring the theme of Catholicism in fashion without being seen to make fun of it. What is special about the Met red carpet – by comparison, for instance, with Cannes – is that you can’t win it just by looking good. A supermodel can wear a tight dress and high heels and sail through almost every other public occasion with flying colours, but that look is a fast track to being completely ignored at the Met. You have to dig deep for this night, because Met Gala triumph requires not just beauty but bravery and a leap of faith. The Vatican would surely approve.The obvious link between the world presided over by Pope Francis and the one ruled by Queen Anna Wintour is that clothing delineates status. Rihanna attacked this theme with her signature fearlessness and blew everyone else out of the water. In the season of the first Millicent Fawcett statue and of a Christian Dior slogan T-shirt namechecking Linda Nochlin’s feminist essay “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists”, RiRi gave us a female pope. She wore a heavily embellished mini dress under a matching cloak, accessorised with a pointed mitre, stiletto heels and pearls strung around one ankle – because, after all, there’s not always room for a rosary in a clutch bag – all created for her by John Galliano for the house of Maison Margiela. The look was a version of an ensemble designed by Galliano during his time at Christian Dior that appeared on the catwalk in 2000 worn by a man, and is included in the Met exhibition.But clothes are never only about power, either in fashion or in the church. Beauty as a metaphor for human goodness runs through the history of art, through religious iconography and through the way fashion worships at the altar of beauty and glamour. Katy Perry was a triumph in Versace. In a gold dress and boots, and with a 6ft white feathered wing, she was arguably the most breathtaking representation of the archangel Gabriel since Fra Angelico painted the Annunciation fresco in the Convent of San Marco. (And yes, I do realise how sacrilegious that is, in artistic terms.)Sienna Miller in gold and white Louis Vuitton was also ine as another Renaissance angel on the red carpet.The transactional business of fashion is a multimillion-pound industry precisely because it taps into powerful emotions and desires. Fashion deliberately blurs the boundaries between things that you have the power to change and the things you don’t. (You can buy the perfect party dress, but you can’t actually buy romance or joy or fun.) Religious imagery has long employed the same porous boundaries, conjuring the invisible into life. The word halo – an accessory seen last night on Solange Knowles in Iris Van Herpen and Lily Collins in Givenchy, among others – means glory. And the aesthetic of papal garments has roots in worldly power, as well as spiritual. When the Emperor Constantine moved his capital east to Constantinople and allowed the pontiffs to assume control the old capital, Rome, they incorporated some of the clothing and accessories worn by the Roman emperors who had ruled before them, the better to legitimise their power in the eyes of the people of Rome.Like all the best dress codes, the Met Gala invitation allowed for lots of iniduality. Frances McDormand consolidated her role as 2018’s designated maverick by coming as “a pagan”, she said on the red carpet, in her Valentino butterfly headdress. Those actors who have pledged vows to fashion houses (or at least, signed contracts with them) showed their constancy with looks that mined clerical robes for the most this-season silhouette. A clear winner on this is the mozzetta, a short shoulder-covering robe worn by the pope and cardinals and, last night, by a very chic Alicia Vikander in Louis Vuitton. Kate Moss wore a black dress with a feathered black neckline that nodded to the dress code with a fallen-angel vibe – this was her first appearance in the US since 2009, and there was speculation that the prolonged absence was due to difficulty procuring a visa after the drug scandal of 2005 – but mainly referenced herself. Moss in a black feather trim dress, with Johnny Depp at Cannes, and a messy bun, is a late-1990s fashion reference the fashion faithful will immediately recognise.Best red-carpet quote of the night, though, goes to the actor Lena Waithe, who wore a rainbow flag cape to spotlight the Catholic church’s complicated relationship with the LGBTQ community. “The theme to me is, like, be yourself,” she told the New York Times on the red carpet. “You were made in God’s image, right?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09e0a9a96f9233e3f77090ecd4cc410fd48d29ec/0_390_3728_2236/master/3728.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83fd67a7881dd316ceb6c4ba862d32e9","title":"roman polanski calls metoo movement mass hysteria","story":"Director who won Academy award for The Pianist dismisses MeToo movement as ‘mass hysteria’ and ‘hypocrisy’Roman Polanski is suing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences after being expelled from the organisation last week.In a letter to the academy, Polanski’s lawyer, Harland Braun, said it failed to follow its own rules or California law by not allowing Polanski a chance to defend himself. “We are not here contesting the merits of the expulsion decision, but rather your organisation’s blatant disregard of its own standards of conduct in, as well as its violations of the standards required by California corporations code,” Braun wrote, according to the Los Angeles Times.The 84-year-old director of Rosemary’s Baby was last week expelled from the academy, which in 2003 awarded him the best-director Oscar for The Pianist. The academy also expelled the actor Bill Cosby. The expulsions were decided in light of sexual assault cases against the two men.Polanski dismissed the \u001dMeToo movement as “mass hysteria” and “hypocrisy” in a Polish interview carried out before he was expelled from the Oscars academy.Asked what he thinks of the movie industry’s recent reckoning with sexual harassment, Polanski told this week’s edition of Newsweek Polska: “I think this is the kind of mass hysteria that occurs in society from time to time.“Sometimes it’s very dramatic, like the French Revolution or the St Bartholomew’s Day massacre in France, or sometimes it’s less bloody, like 1968 in Poland or McCarthyism in the US..“Everyone is trying to back this movement, mainly out of fear … I think it’s total hypocrisy.”Polanski, a dual Polish and French citizen who lives in France, is wanted in the US for the 1977 rape of Samantha Geimer. He has for years sought to negotiate a deal in the case with US authorities.Geimer, who has said in the past that she has forgiven Polanski, dismissed the Academy’s move to expel him as “an ugly and cruel action which serves only appearance”.Polanski himself called the decision last week “the height of hypocrisy”, according to his lawyer Jan Olszewski.Olszewski added that comparing Polanski to Bill Cosby, who was also expelled from the Academy for sexual assault, was “a total misunderstanding and harassment”.The expulsions came as Hollywood reels from the assault allegations against disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein, which prompted an international uproar and encouraged legions of women to share their own experience of sexual harassment or rape under the hashtag \u001dMeToo.• This article was corrected on 9 May 2018 because an earlier version gave Rosemary’s Baby as the film for which Roman Polanski won his director award."},{"url":null,"title":"southampton twitter swansea hotel cancellation","story":"• Southampton endorse TripAdvisor review of hotel in Swansea• ‘Not planning to return any time soon’ included in mocking reviewSouthampton have poked fun at the hotel that cancelled their booking before their crucial game against Swansea City on Tuesday by endorsing a critical review of the venue on Twitter.The south coast club were bitterly upset after being prevented from staying at the Marriott Hotel in Swansea but they had the last laugh after Manolo Gabbiadini’s winner at the Liberty Stadium on Tuesday all but secured Southampton’s Premier League status and left Swansea City on the brink of relegation to the Championship.Having used the inconvenience as a motivational tool, Southampton can afford to look on the funny side now and they got their own back by tweeting a photo of a TripAdvisor review from a supporter who said they also had their booking cancelled by the Marriott. “Just some feedback” the club tweeted.The poster used Southampton’s crest as their profile picture and appeared to make references to Swansea’s heartbreaking defeat in a one-star review which has since been deleted by TripAdvisor.“Had been due to stay here for an extremely important business trip, only to have our reservation cancelled 24 hours before arrival, due to an apparent virus outbreak,” the poster, who used WeMarchOn as a pseudonym, said. “Very disappointing, as other guests’ bookings seemed to be unaffected – Fortunately the experience didn’t sour our trip. Business meeting was extremely productive! Not planning to return any time soon.”Mark Hughes said after the game that “dark arts” were at play, although the Southampton manager stressed that he apportioned no blame to Swansea for the cancellation. “I’m not for one minute suggesting Swansea had anything to do with that,” Hughes said. “It’s just maybe over-zealous Swansea fans in positions to affect our hotel booking. But those things you can use to your own benefit and use as a motivating factor.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e80d4826a87e3400fa63bc5425ab12a395ba1218/1171_790_1711_1026/master/1711.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6345aa44c57ba52c433c37f1133af37e","title":"which footballers have been made to shave by a manager or chairman","story":"Plus: Champions League and Europa League winners from the same city and the longest run between European Cup finals. Mail us your answers or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“Has any player ever been made to shave his beard off by a manager or chairman?” asked Sam Holden last week.As is frequently the case with questions like this, we begin with Brian Clough, who ordered striker Garry Birtles to defuzz his face before the 1979 European Cup final. “The story goes that as the players congregated in the hotel foyer prior to boarding the coach to the stadium, ‘Ol Big Ead, in one of the many examples of his brilliant man-management, noticed that Birtles looked nervous,” writes Duncan Wilson. “Cloughie ordered him to go back to his room and shave before boarding the coach – the theory being that by concentrating on shaving, his mind would be taken off the upcoming match. Naturally the player did as he was instructed, and the team could then make their way to the Olympic Stadium in Munich to defeat Malmö, lift their first European Cup, and cement theirs and Clough’s place in folklore.”Daniel Passarella famously instructed his players to cut their hair when he was in charge of the Argentina team, but one of his predecessors did encourage the removal of facial fuzz. During the 1978 World Cup, César Luis Menotti suggested Mario Kempes have a shave, with impressive results. “I couldn’t be bothered with the whole shaving-every-couple-of-days routine,” Kempes said in 2007. “After nearly three weeks I had a pretty decent beard and moustache going. I played like that in our first two games, but shaved the beard off before our third. We were heading back to our camp after that match, thinking ahead to our next assignment in Rosario, when the coach said to me: ‘Mario, why don’t you get rid of the moustache and see if your luck changes?’” Kempes went on to score six goals in four games, including two in the final as Argentina won their first World Cup.Florian Labrouche nominates Gaël Givet’s experience with Evian in 2014. Givet told Le Parisien: “Three days before my first game, I was called into the president’s office for something that seemed crazy and that had nothing to do with football. I was completely disgusted. The problem was that I let my beard grow. At Evian, they wanted to force me to shave because it was too long. At 33, you cannot treat me this way. They took me for a jihadist, while I haven’t even converted to Islam.” Givet made just one appearance for the Ligue 2 side.David Poza nominates Roy Greenwood, who played at Sunderland from 1975 to 1978. “Bob Stokoe, then the manager of the team, asked Roy to shave his beard in order to appear in the team photo. Greenwood refused, and didn’t appear in any more team photographs.” Finally, there’s Celtic’s Danny McGrain, who nearly came a cropper of Albanian leader Enver Hoxha making beards illegal at the time of their 1979 European Cup first-round first leg tie against Partizan Tirana. McGrain’s tale was the subject of a Knowledge from way back when.“With Madrid having a team in each European final,” begins Josh McGarry, “I wondered if both trophies have ever been won by teams from the same city in the same season before?”Yes they have. In 1994 Milan was the place to be, with Fabio Capello’s side having won the Champions League by getting the better of Johan Cruyff’s Barcelona, while across town Inter beat the admittedly less glitzy Casino Salzburg to lift the Uefa Cup. If we throw the sadly departed Cup Winners’ Cup into the mix, no two teams from the same city have ever won that and one of the others in the same season, but if we spool back to 1989-90 then all three resided in northern Italy: Milan held the big pot, Sampdoria won the Cup Winners’ Cup and Juventus beat Fiorentina in the final of the Uefa Cup. “If Edwin van der Sar plays for Manchester United in the Champions League final, it will be 13 years since he appeared for Ajax in the 1995 final,” wrote Firat Topal, this week back in 2008. “Is this the longest run between two finals for a player?”“You have to look no further than the great Paolo Maldini,” wrote Rich Limb. “He first played in the Champions League final, or the old European Cup as it was then, with Milan in 1989. “His last appearance in the final was last year (and on both occasions he lifted the trophy). So his record, which is particularly amazing for an outfield player, is 18 years.” Lest we forget, Rich, the same applies to Alessandro Costacurta who, despite not playing in the 2007 final at the age of 41, received a winner’s medal.“Virgil van Dijk started the season at Southampton, who could go down, and ends it with Liverpool who could be European champions. Has anyone played for a team that have gone down and won the European Cup in the same season?” asks Mike Coxon.“Two players were sent off following a scuffle in Swindon’s win over Accrington” notes Paul Fulcher. “They were James Deane of Swindon and James (or Jimmy) Deane of Accrington. Have two namesakes been sent off together before?”“If Tony Pulis gets Middlesbrough through the Championship play-offs, will he be the first manager to be promoted and relegated in the same season?” muses Dominic Piper.“Due to the timing of Premier League kick-offs, the team in 19th place, Stoke, was relegated before the team below it in 20th. Has this ever happened before?” wonders Steven Higgins.• Send your questions and answers to knowledge@the or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94d16399872ed21e11f036ab72bfba568c1f3dcc/128_176_1584_950/master/1584.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25a6788619da7f0ce088bb931f521474","title":"the joy of six football moves named after players","story":"From the Cruyff turn to early 20th century acrobatics, half a dozen stylistic flourishes named after their exponentsThe bulky 6ft 3in former Honduras striker (and one-time Birmingham City loanee) Carlo Costly is not an obvious skill merchant, but he carries in his locker one of the most delightful tricks in the modern game. It’s typically implemented when Costly is on the left side of the pitch with a defender alongside him on his inside. He will drop his pace to a jog and then languidly swing his left foot up and backwards in a fake backheel. At this point the defender invariably takes a step forwards, seeking to cut out the backheel, only for Costly to hit the gas and surge away. The trick is known as the costlyña in his homeland and, as video footage demonstrates, its capacity for rendering opposing defenders flatfooted is uncanny. Costly used his trick to memorable effect in a 2013 friendly against Ecuador in Houston. After cantering on to a pass down the inside-right channel, he dropped a costlyña to ease the defender Jorge Guagua out of his way before curling a magnificent shot into the top-left corner.On a tour of Central Europe in April 1901, Southampton’s Jack Robinson caused jaws to drop by keeping goal with an athleticism that none of the locals had ever witnessed. As an England international, Robinson’s fame preceded him and when Southampton arrived to play Slavia Prague, he was persuaded to give a display of his agility before kick-off. Robinson’s team-mates peppered his goal with shots and in the words of the club secretary, Ernest Arnfield, “scarcely a ball passed him”. Local supporters were used to seeing goalkeepers stretching and reaching, but Robinson threw his whole body into spectacular low saves that drew gasps from the crowd. When he had finished showing off his reflexes, spectators streamed on the pitch and chaired him off. Southampton played further games in Vienna and Budapest and finished their tour with a record of seven straight wins. By the time the squad left for home, Robinson had become a regional celebrity. Eye-catching saves were known as robinzonádas in Czechoslovakia, Austria and Hungary until well into the 20th century, and robinsonada remains in use today in Poland.Several countries equate ing headers with fish, the common denominator being horizontal, head-first movement, but in Brazil the gol de peixinho (“little fish goal”) owes its name to Peixinho, a former São Paulo winger who scored the first ever goal at Éstadio do Morumbi. Born Arnaldo Poffo Garcia, he was dubbed Peixinho (“Little Fish”) in honour of his father, Peixe (“Fish”), who had played for Santos in the 1940s. Peixinho was in the starting line-up when São Paulo played Sporting Lisbon in a friendly to inaugurate the Morumbi on 2 October 1960. In the 12th minute he made history by flinging himself at a right-wing cross from Jonas to head home the only goal. His name has become synonymous with flying headers in Brazil.During Mexico’s game against South Korea at the 1998 World Cup, Cuauhtémoc Blanco unveiled an innovation that instantly earned global acclaim. Twice during the second half in Lyon, Blanco collected possession wide on the left, allowed two defenders to close in on him and gripped the ball between his feet and leapt through the gap between his opponents. Mexicans came to know it as the cuauhtemiña (effectively, “little Cuauhtémoc move”). It was ungainly but effective and it brought a smile to the face – much like Blanco himself, who delighted in using his body in strange and unusual ways on the pitch. His other tricks included the jorobiña (“little hunchback flick”) and the nalguiña (“little arse flick”).Arguably the most influential figure in modern football history, Johan Cruyff gifted the game a move so simple and yet so devastating that it’s difficult to imagine the sport without it. Cruyff presented his turn to the world during a 0-0 draw against Sweden at the 1974 World Cup. Finding his route blocked by the Swedish right-back Jan Olsson, Cruyff made as if to play the ball infield, only to drag the ball behind his standing leg with his right foot and race off towards the byline. “That moment against Cruyff was the proudest moment of my career,” Olsson told David Winner in Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football. “I was not humiliated. I had no chance. Cruyff was a genius.”If it seemed inconceivable, however, that a trick so straightforward could never have been performed before, that’s because it was. Pelé was baffling defenders by flicking the ball behind his standing leg when Cruyff was still in short trousers and a British Movietone film from 1960 shows the Barcelona striker Eulogio Martínez pulling off a succession of textbook Cruyff turns during a European Cup match at Wolves. His widely accepted position as the inventor of the move owes much to the fact the 1974 World Cup was beamed into more homes than any tournament before. One ingenious piece of trickery turned the Irish winger Aiden McGeady into something of a global reference point. A well-watched YouTube clip shows him pulling off his trademark move during a game between Celtic and Aberdeen in October 2004. Having run on to a pass from John Hartson, McGeady finds himself facing the left-hand touchline with his back to the play. As Aberdeen’s Steve Tosh approaches from behind, McGeady performs a Cruyff turn directly into Tosh’s path, but then flicks the ball down the touchline with the outside of his left foot, leaving his opponent comically flatfooted as he scampers away. McGeady performed the trick so readily that it was soon included as a skill move in the Fifa game series, where it’s known as the McGeady spin.• This is an edited extract from Do You Speak Football?

By June, one of four reasonable heavyweights – Aston Villa, Derby, Fulham or Middlesbrough – will be back in the Premier League.Four legs and a final, at Wembley, will decide who that is but until then, let the brave, often defeatist, meaningless rogue predictions, mind games and number crunching commence. Now is the time to be choked by cliche how form is temporary, class is permanent and how head-to-head records and the state of the league table counts for nothing any more. Or does it?Fulham finished third after blowing the chance to gain passage to the Premier League at Cardiff City’s expense but have the chance to redeem themselves when they travel to Derby County on Friday evening before the second leg at Craven Cottage on Monday. They are yet to win a play-off game in six attempts, two of which came last season against Reading. In the past 15 years, the race to win automatic promotion has gone down to the final day on five occasions, with the loser reaching the top flight via the play-offs just once West Ham United, in 2012. Slavisa Jokanovic’s customary cool smacks of confidence, unsurprising given they were previously 23 games unbeaten, but in Derby, who finished sixth, they face a team that has reignited their own self-belief, trumpeting their own chances. “You can see they feel there is a little bit of extra zip, you can feel that bit of extra belief,” said Gary Rowett of his side. “We have almost been given a second chance and a side like that is going to be very dangerous.”Fulham looked stuck in the mud last time out, uncharacteristically sloppy compared with their usual vigour Ryan Sessegnon was shackled, Tom Cairney abnormally passive and Marcus Bettinelli, the goalkeeper, far too busy for Jokanovic’s liking. They are a wonderful team, but seem to struggle in one-off games, especially against more stubborn sides. Derby possess plenty of attacking threats, namely the Championship’s top scorer, Matej Vydra, but also that invaluable savvy streak and shed loads of experience.In the other semi-final, fourth-place Aston Villa and fifth-place Middlesbrough will do battle. There are a few neat subplots Albert Adomah and Adama Traoré facing their former clubs and Tony Pulis, the former West Bromwich Albion manager, renewing his rivalry with the claret and blue half of the West Midlands. Whether Traoré can shine against the club that brought him, from Barcelona B, to the country in 2015 will be particularly enticing. The speeding 22-year-old has lit up games that Middlesbrough have huffed and puffed their way through and, after the final game of the regular season, he had a clear message for fans. At full time at Portman Road, Traoré carried a black plastic blag towards a throng of young away supporters leant against the advertising hoardings, before handing out several shirts with his name and No 37 on the back, as well as the word “believe” underneath. Inspiring, yes, but Middlesbrough will need him and Patrick Bamford, another player rejuvenated under Pulis, firing if they are to overcome Villa.Steve Bruce’s side have been planning in earnest, with his assistant, Colin Calderwood, admitting their staff have prepared a “vault” of information centred on Middlesbrough. They rested a host of players in readiness for the play-off matches –Jack Grealish, John Terry, and Lewis Grabban were among those given a breather in the defeat at Millwall – with the manager conscious of his players “running out of gas” at the end of a long season. “We will have done our homework and we have experienced players, without a doubt,” said Villa’s Conor Hourihane. “The names speak for themselves. We’ll be ready and we are all looking forward to it. Ultimately, it is a game of football.”• The Football League play-offs get under way at the Valley on Thursday evening, when Charlton Athletic host Shrewsbury Town. Charlton won their last three matches to sneak into sixth while Paul Hurst’s side, who topped League One in November, have won just one of their past seven matches. “It’s a lot of effort these lads have put in to get ourselves in a position we could only have dreamed of at the beginning,” Hurst said.• A 22-man squad arrived in Myanmar on Tuesday afternoon for Leeds United’s heavily criticised post-season tour, given the UN have accused the country of ethnic cleansing against its Rohingya Muslim minority.

Kevin Tomlinson said he would get Monk’s face inked on his bum if Birmingham beat Fulham on Sunday. “Just paid for it, pal!

The four Ethiopian boys pause for breath and refreshment beside the road, grasping their plastic water bottles tightly as they sip, careful not to waste a drop. The Djiboutian sun is still low in the sky but the road is already hot. They have more than 200km left to walk and their plastic sandals are disintegrating.Badru and friends are from Jimma, a poor farming district in Ethiopia’s Oromia region. Over the past fortnight they have travelled more than 1,000km from their homes, first on buses and then later on foot, jumping the border into neighbouring Djibouti under the cover of darkness. When the group gathered in Dire Dawa, a town in the arid drylands of eastern Ethiopia a couple of hundred kilometres from the border, there were 20 of them. “Most are left in the desert,” says Badru wearily. “They are very tired. I don’t think they can follow us.”Many do not make it. The numbers that die in the Djiboutian desert are unknown but there are enough unburied dead to contaminate the water supply. Ethiopians walking along the road north to Obock told the  that friends had perished en route. Another group of three, also from Jimma, say they had no food for the duration of the six-day walk from Dire Dawa. Seven of their companions were left in the desert some got lost, they say, but one they watched die. “We’ve had no help from anyone,” says the youngest, a 10-year-old orphan.The journey across the Bab el-Mandeb strait to Yemen is also perilous. One recent estimate put the numbers who have died making the crossing over the past decade at close to 3,000. The boats organised by smugglers are old, rickety and often overcrowded. Few Ethiopians can swim but the vessels, which depart at night in order to avoid detection, usually hover 20m or so away from the shore, which can be fatal for those clambering aboard.The anarchy in Yemen brings a welter of dangers. In January at least 30 people drowned when their migrant boat capsized, with reports of gunfire being used against those on board. In March 2017, a helicopter opened fire on a vessel carrying more than 140 migrants, killing 42 Somalis. Those who make it to shore then face multiple threats. UNHCR has catalogued reports of physical and sexual abuse, abduction, extortion, torture and forced labour by smugglers and criminal networks. “Only a very small minority make it to Saudi Arabia without facing at least one incident of abuse,” says Danielle Botti of the regional mixed migration secretariat (RMMS), which monitors movements between the Horn of Africa and Yemen.Those who survive remain vulnerable. Some are deported straight back to Yemen rather than home, in violation of international law. Some have their passports taken away by their employers, which is against international labour conventions. Francesco Martialis, head of Caritas, which works with street children in Djibouti, recounts the story of a 15-year-old who had fled life as a slave in Saudi Arabia. He had been beaten, his skull cracked, leaving him with amnesia. Unable to remember his family or his home, he had walked hundreds of kilometres alone along the road from Obock to Djibouti City, in the country’s south, before being picked up by police.Young Ethiopians in Obock are either unaware or unfazed by the dangers awaiting across the sea. Around 250 have set up makeshift homes under acacia trees and in caves beneath the cliffs near the rubbish-strewn village of Fantahero. “So what?” asks Hassen, a 20-year-old teacher from Wollo region. “That’s the life of the Ethiopian people.” His companion, Murad, 18, agrees: “We fear Ethiopia more than the war in Yemen.”Many cite persecution and violence as reasons for fleeing. Oromos, the country’s largest ethnic group, complain of marginalisation for more than three years anti-government protests and deadly confrontations with security forces have plagued the region. “I quit my schooling and came here,” says Mohammed, a 17-year-old from Arsi in southern Oromia. “I was a ninth-grade student. But when I saw youths like myself being arrested and thrown in jail I decided to leave. I was afraid of being arrested too.”But for most, poverty is the biggest grievance. “I’m going to Yemen because I need work,” says Hassen. “There’s nothing in Ethiopia. I have a job but it is too expensive there – 2,000 birr (£53) a month? That is not enough! In Saudi Arabia I will get 10,000 birr a month.”Three days earlier, police had arrived in Fantahero and loaded many of the boys into trucks to deposit at the Ethiopian border. But on the whole the migrants are tolerated. Obock locals have done well out of smuggling and a journey that costs somewhere between $300 and $500 (£221-£368) per person. “Nobody will control it,” says Momina Ahmed, a French-Djiboutian who grew up in the town. “All the locals, including the authorities, are profiting.”An IOM transit centre in Obock, across the road from a UNHCR camp for Yemeni refugees fleeing in other direction, is one of the few institutions available for people who want to return to Ethiopia. It assists with voluntary returns, but it can take in only around 250 at any one time. Mohammed, the schoolboy from Arsi, says he is one of the few in Fantahero to get cold feet, but that the centre was full when he visited earlier in the day.Elsewhere in Djibouti, facilities are even more scarce. Mobile health patrols started work only late last year. There are plans to build a humanitarian shelter at Lake Assal, near where the desert hits the coast. There is only one shelter in Djibouti City for migrant children, Caritas, and it is prohibited from providing beds at night.Few will return home without something to show for their efforts. “If it is the will of Allah to improve my life, then maybe one day I will return to Ethiopia,” Badru says fatalistically. Just as he speaks a police truck pulls round the corner. Within moments, the four boys have been ushered into the back by armed police officers, their long, hard journey cut suddenly short."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf46f4f4310ad2771fd5e41f58d5b4fac40da6d4/0_477_2385_1431/master/2385.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a76b1eccc18a98e43d38582886031e05","title":"six of the best party snacks","story":"Elevate the nibbles for your next do by whipping up salt cod fritters, pork hand pies or shrimp and caper bunsFor the pastry175g butter, diced200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting2 tsp grated parmesan1 egg yolk15ml ice-cold water1 tsp saltFor the fillingJuice of 1 lemon100ml olive oilSalt and black pepper1 fennel bulb, finely diced 20g dill (or fennel top), chopped300g white crab meat150g brown crab meat10g parsley, chopped 1 pinch cayenne pepperHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6.

Turn on the mixer and add the warm milk to the flour until well mixed. Knead in the machine until you have a shiny dough. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and put in a warm place to prove until doubled in size – one to two hours. Dust a work surface with flour and split the dough into 12 equal pieces, roll into balls and place on a greaseproof tray, cover with clingfilm and leave to double again in size. When ready, bake for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown.To make the filling, boil the eggs for seven minutes and rinse under cold water. Peel the eggs and chop finely, then add the shrimp, capers, mayonnaise and tarragon, mix well, and season to taste. To serve, split and butter the buns and fill with the egg and shrimp.For the flatbreads2½ tsp dried yeast700ml warm water120g yoghurt250g wholemeal bread flour600g bread flour1 tbsp saltOlive oil, for brushingFor the topping5 ripe tomatoes1 tsp capers100ml olive oil Juice and zest of ½ lemon½ bunch parsley, choppedSalt and black pepper1 tin anchovy fillets in oilCelery leaves (optional)In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water, then add the yoghurt. Add the flours, and salt, then mix with your fingertips until a dough forms. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave to rise at room temperature.After an hour, knead the dough until it comes away from the sides of the bowl. If it looks a little wet, add a bit of flour. Cover and chill, ideally overnight otherwise, leave to stand at room temperature until it has doubled in size.An hour before serving, grate the tomatoes into a bowl using the large side of a box grater. Add the capers, oil and lemon juice to make a fresh tomato dressing.Heat a griddle pan on high, then ide the dough into six portions. On a floured surface, roll out each portion into ½cm-thick rounds.Brush the grill rack with oil, dust the flatbreads with a little more flour, then cook the breads until lightly charred on one side.

Put the flour and salt in a bowl. Put the water, milk and butter in a saucepan and bring to a boil. As soon as it boils, turn off the heat. Tip in the flour and quickly start beating with a wooden spoon or electric whisk. Keep mixing until the dough is lump-free and has formed a ball that pulls away from the sides of the pan.Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and add to the dough a little at a time, beating well until fully incorporated. When it is ready, the mixture will be shiny and smooth.Put all the other ingredients in a bowl and slowly combine with the choux batter.Heat the oil in a large, deep saucepan to 180C350F. Using a tablespoon, add small dollops of the fritter mixture to the hot oil in small batches.Fry until deep brown, turning occasionally so they cook evenly. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper-covered baking tray in the oven to keep warm.1 onion, peeled and finely diced1 knob butter3g black pepper3g fennel seeds½ tsp ground mace1 garlic clove, peeled and minced150ml good dry cider380g minced pork shoulder 100g minced bacon10g sage, chopped10g parsley, chopped500g all-butter puff pastry1 egg yolk, beaten10ml double creamHeat the oven to 190C375Fgas 5.To make the filling, fry the onion in the butter until soft and sweet. Add the spices, garlic and cider, and reduce until the liquid evaporates, then set aside to cool.Put the pork, bacon, herbs and onion mixture in a bowl, season and mix well.Roll out the pastry to about 3mm thick. Using an 11-12cm cutter, cut out 12 rounds for the pie bases. Then, using a 6-7cm cutter, cut out 12 lids. Line a 12-hole muffin tin with the pie bases, shaping the pastry to fit the sides – it should come slightly above the rim of each mould.Put a heaped tablespoon of the filling into each case. Mix together the beaten egg and the double cream to make an egg wash, then brush the rims with the wash and top the pies with the lids. Crimp the edges and brush the tops with more egg. Prick holes in the top of the lids with a fork, then bake for 40-50 minutes, until golden brown.To make the quince mustard, mix the mustard with the quince paste and serve with the pork pies.For the crackers150g rye flour150g plain flour5g dried yeast2 tsp salt1½ tsp linseeds300ml warm waterFor the topping500g swiss chard200g peas1 garlic clove, peeled and thinly sliced5g dried chilli10g mint, chopped10ml olive oil150g goat’s curd50ml milkJuice and zest of ½ lemonHeat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4.

That said, low-key isn’t the phrase that immediately springs to mind when confronted with their performance. The stage is bedecked with so many flowers and so much foliage it looks less like the Royal Festival Hall than the Royal Horticultural Society spring show. The band numbers eight, including two keyboard players, two percussionists and a harpist who occasionally ersifies with glockenspiel, and the venue’s enormous pipe organ – usually concealed behind boards at the rear of the stage – is on display and primed for use during the encore.It’s intended as no slight on the organist to say it that doesn’t make much difference to the overall sound. One of the effects of cramming a band used to playing arenas into somewhere smaller is that they invariably sound immense, as if the venue is struggling to contain their sound. So it is tonight, which fits Florence + the Machine’s music. Their – well, her – stock-in-trade is high drama, heavy on the rumbling drums and roaring vocals. It says something that a song as breezily anthemic as 2015 single Ship to Wreck, complete with its Fleetwood Mac-like chorus, represents one of the more subdued moments. A handful of songs from the band’s forthcoming fourth album, High as Hope, seem to dial down the ostentation slightly – such things are obviously relative, but there is a folky simplicity about current single Sky Full of Song – at least until they get to 100 Years, a track so gung-ho in its theatrical swoops from gentle piano ballad to tom-tom pounding and violin scraping it makes the other gung-ho theatrical tracks they’ve come up with thus far sound as if they were merely warming up.It can all be a bit much on record, but it gains an appealingly visceral force live. The same is true of Florence Welch’s voice: what sounds histrionic coming out of a pair of headphones makes more sense amid the tumult of the band’s live sound. The stagecraft designed to reach the nosebleed seats at Frankfurt’s Jahrhunderthalle looks a little nuts close up. There is a great deal of creeping around on tiptoes and a preponderance of expressive hand gestures. At one juncture, Welch crouches at the front of the stage, blank-eyed, apparently lost in the moment – one slightly spoiled by the fact that the stage is low, and the spotlight picking her out illuminates a security guard, blinking and looking as mortified as it is possible for a person to look.Welch – who can’t swig a bottle of water at the rear of the stage without twirling around and waving her arms about en route – cuts a wildly OTT figure. But you’d be hard-pushed to suggest she isn’t entertainingly OTT, compounded by the feeling – again not always obvious on record – that she doesn’t take herself quite as seriously as you might expect. At one point, she earnestly implores the audience to put their phones away and their hands in their air. “This moment is going to disappear, and we’re going to allow it to disappear,” she says, then reconsiders. “Unless you come to another show, and then obviously, we’ll do it again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/910ab0f620e2e35b3ef7aa765bf4546fcfabac42/0_0_5568_3712/master/5568.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=198b85a24b0ab6338a2711925534b947 1320w","title":"labour peers force may to give mps vote over single market plans","story":"More than 80 Labour peers defy whip on amendment calling for vote on EEA membershipMPs will have a vote on remaining in the European Economic Area – effectively a vote on the single market – after a shock defeat for the government in the Lords.It means the Brexit strategy of both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn has been blown apart in the last 24 hours.The rebel Labour amendment in the Lords opened the prospect of a Commons vote on the EEA – a less stringent version of the single market – after 83 Labour peers voted against the party whip. Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP who co-chairs a pro-European Commons committee with Conservative Anna Soubry, said the leadership would now have to come off the fence and make it clear where it stood. “The time for constructive ambiguity is over: our members and our voters will be delighted with this clear signal that we will not go along with this Tory Brexit,” he said.The vote came hours after Boris Johnson called the prime minister’s proposal for a customs partnership “crazy” in an interview with the Daily Mail that dealt a major blow to the government’s strategy of a cautious balance between leave and remain. Johnson was the subject of fierce criticism from within Tory ranks all day. In the Lords debate the former Tory MP Patrick Cormack asked: “What sort of example are we being given by a cabinet that is rent asunder by the foreign secretary, the second most important cabinet minister, rubbishing the prime minister in the columns of the Daily Mail?”On the key EEA amendment, Labour peers were whipped to abstain. But 83 defied the whip to back the amendment, including a former party leader, many former ministers and a former chief whip. Seventeen Conservatives also backed the amendment.It was the third defeat of the afternoon for the government and an unexpected triumph for a cross-party group that included Waheed Alli for Labour, the Conservative peer Sandip Verma and the crossbench peer Karan Bilimoria.All the amendments to the bill that have been passed in the Lords will have to be considered and voted on by MPs when the bill returns to the Commons, perhaps as soon as next week. Lord Alli told the House that continued membership of the EEA was vital to ensure the future profitability of the UK’s export business and the jobs and livelihoods of many thousands of people. “It is the EEA that deals with services, services like retail, tourism, transport, communications, financial services and aerospace where we have a £14bn trade surplus,” he said.“The customs union only will benefit our European neighbours in their imports and without an EEA equivalent it will damage our profitable export business.” In a rowdy and sometimes ill-tempered debate peers, many of whom had been debating the EU for the past 30 years, argued passionately for and against EEA membership.Officially Labour opposed the Alli amendment because other amendments gave MPs a role in the negotiations. But the leadership will now have to face the tension between its strongly pro-remain rank and file membership, its largely pro-remain MPs and the policy consequences of remaining in any arrangement with Europe such as the EEA, which limits its plans for greater state involvement in the economy.The Tories are now likely to try to brand Labour as the party of free movement, which is one of the obligations of EEA membership. The threat of higher EU migration is likely to alarm Labour voters in some parts of the country. A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesperson said: “The referendum was a vote to take control of our borders, laws and money. Ongoing participation in the EEA would mean having to implement new EU legislation automatically and in its entirety without having a say on how it is formulated – and it would also mean continued free movement. We will now consider the implications of this decision.”Peter Mandelson, the former trade secretary and one-time EU trade commissioner, said ministers were perpetrating a “Brexit fraud’ by pretending that migration from the EU, which would continue under membership of the EEA, would end after the UK left.“The time has come for economic reality and commonsense to prevail over wishful thinking and political dogma,” he said. “This gives us the opportunity to do the right thing for the country and in my view that is what we have a duty to do.”The EEA offers most of the benefits of the single market, without being subject to the European court of justice. It does not cover the common agriculture or fisheries policies. Earlier, peers voted to remove the EU exit date of 29 March 2019 from the withdrawal bill, warning that it would be a straitjacket for negotiators. The Duke of Wellington, Charles Wellesley, who moved the amendment, insisted he was not trying to undermine the result of the referendum by delaying or averting Brexit.“We should give ministers a bit more flexibility to secure and obtain ratification of the best possible deal, which will do the least damage to the economy and the national interest,” he said.The government also lost another vote on an amendment seeking to protect UK membership of EU agencies such as Euratom. The Labour leader in the Lords, Angela Smith, said it was an opportunity for the Commons to think again.“The House of Lords amendment is not about stopping Brexit but the fine print of when and how the agreements are concluded,” she said.The defeats came on the final day of debate on the report stage of the bill in the Lords. Peers are due to send it back to the Commons at the end of the week, and the government hopes it will be on the statute book before the end of May. The government has been forced to make concessions, as well as losing a dozen votes during the debates, in a series of amendments that have often had cross-party support.The amendments have been ided between trying to preserve benefits of EU membership, such as workers rights, and other fundamental rights through the incorporation of the EU’s charter of fundamental rights, which has a broader reach than the UK Human Rights Act.Others were intended to promote the place of parliament at the heart of the process of leaving the EU, including clarifying the significance and consequences of the “meaningful vote” on any Brexit deal. And some were more narrowly technical, intended to restrict ministerial powers to change laws without proper parliamentary process and debate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ed4f61c099f2a78dd464d988e019864ea5a48ba/0_73_840_504/master/840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3edbabe02840d405089394db2bbeda6","title":"how bereaved parents became accidental world leaders in 3d printing","story":"Naveed and Samiya Parvez watched their son, who had cerebral palsy, suffer distressing measuring methods to get the splints and braces he needed. Now, they’ve revolutionised the processNaveed and Samiya Parvez built a business so that other families wouldn’t have to suffer what they did. The couple set up healthcare service Andiamo following the death of their nine-year-old son, Diamo. Diamo had cerebral palsy and relied on braces and splints, known as orthoses, to support and protect his body. The process of getting fitted for orthoses caused Diamo and his family so much distress that Naveed and Samiya became determined to find an alternative.The procedure for being measured for orthoses was a harrowing experience for Diamo. Naveed had to restrain him to keep him still while cold plaster was wrapped around him – a process that takes an hour. “He went blue in the face screaming when they did this to him. You’re pinning a child down who is non-communicative,” he says. “You’d be horrified doing that to an adult – doing that to a kid who has no idea what is happening to them is even worse.” It would then take three to six months for the orthoses to be created on the NHS, by which point Diamo would have grown, so the fit was rarely a good one. The family also tried private healthcare services, which could create the orthoses within six weeks, but used the same plaster cast process and so were just as unreliable in terms of fit. Private treatment was also prohibitively expensive, with one brace, which would be outgrown within nine months, costing around £5,000. He and Samiya consulted experts and researched 3D printing, scanning and materials science, and 12 months later created the first prototypes for orthoses. Their London-based business uses 3D scanning and printing to measure and produce orthoses for children and young adults who are unable to use their limbs, or can’t control their posture. “3D printing experts started coming to us and saying ‘We’ve never seen what you’ve done before,’” says Naveed. “We had Google ringing us up for advice. That’s when we realised that this tiny little team with this crazy idea had suddenly become a world leader by accident.”The measurement process involves moving a handheld 3D scanner over the body for about a minute. The scan is much more accurate than a plaster cast – and the whole process is even fun, according to Naveed: “Kids love it. Either they want to watch what’s going on, because it’s cool and interesting, or they’re watching a cartoon on their tablet while we quickly scan them, and they’re just completely oblivious.” The 3D-printed orthosis is lighter and less cumbersome than a traditional brace, is ready within a week, and costs approximately £1,500.Since Andiamo launched, other companies offering 3D-printed orthoses have emerged, such as Plus Medica, but Naveed says Andiamo is the only service of its type focused on paediatrics. “We designed the whole process around the family’s experience,” says Naveed.Naveed and Samiya, who currently have 30 patients and have delivered 160 orthoses to date, now plan to expand. “Our goal is to see at least another 100 new patients in the next 18 months,” says Naveed. Orthoses have broad applications across the medical world, such as in healing complex fractures, so Andiamo’s potential is huge. Naveed and Samiya hope to treat 15 million children over the next 10 years.“We couldn’t really think of a better way of remembering Diamo than being able to create a legacy that means that no other child or family has to go through what we did,” says Naveed. “That bloody-mindedness just pushed us through.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6555b5ec10d71895ce8ab3bf5110caf27e4820e/0_40_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fab0391de9270c1b50f93f463ee4f3c","title":"how oregon grew too much marijuana to sell","story":"Oregon farmers have grown three times what their customers can smoke in a year, causing bud prices to plummet and panic to set inA recent Sunday afternoon at the Bridge City Collective cannabis shop in north Portland saw a steady flow of customers.Little wonder: a gram of weed was selling for less than the price of a glass of wine.The $4 and $5 grams enticed Scotty Saunders, a 24-year-old sporting a gray hoodie, to spend $88 picking out new products to try with a friend. “We’ve definitely seen a huge drop in prices,” he says.Across the wood and glass counter, Bridge City owner David Alport was less delighted. He says he’s never sold marijuana this cheap before.“We have standard grams on the shelf at $4,” Alport says. “Before, we didn’t see a gram below $8.”The scene at Bridge City Collective is playing out across the city and state. Three years into Oregon’s era of recreational cannabis, the state is inundated with legal weed.It turns out Oregonians are good at growing cannabis – too good.In February, state officials announced that 1.1m pounds of cannabis flower were logged in the state’s database.If a million pounds sounds like a lot of pot, that’s because it is: last year, Oregonians smoked, vaped or otherwise consumed just under 340,000lb of legal bud.That means Oregon farmers have grown three times what their clientele can smoke in a year.Yet state documents show the number of Oregon weed farmers is poised to double this summer – without much regard to whether there’s demand to fill.The result? Prices are dropping to unprecedented lows in auction houses and on dispensary counters across the state.Wholesale sun-grown weed fell from $1,500 a pound last summer to as low as $700 by mid-October. On store shelves, that means the price of sun-grown flower has been sliced in half to those four-buck grams.For Oregon customers, this is a bonanza. A gram of the beloved Girl Scout Cookies strain now sells for little more than two boxes of actual Girl Scout cookies.But it has left growers and sellers with a high-cost product that’s a financial loser. And a new feeling has descended on the once-confident Oregon cannabis industry: panic.“The business has been up and down and up and down,” says Don Morse, who closed his Human Collective II dispensary in south-west Portland four months ago. “But in a lot of ways it has just been down and down for dispensaries.”This month, WW spoke to two dozen people across Oregon’s cannabis industry. They describe a bleak scene: small businesses laying off employees and shrinking operations. Farms shuttering. People losing their life’s savings are unable to declare bankruptcy because marijuana is still a federally scheduled narcotic.To be sure, every new market creates winners and losers. But the glut of legal weed places Oregon’s young industry in a precarious position, and could swiftly reshape it.Oregon’s wineries, breweries and distilleries have experienced some of the same kind of shakeout over time. But the timetable is faster with pot: for many businesses, it’s boom to bust within months.Mom-and-pop farms are accepting lowball offers to sell to out-of-state investors, and what was once a erse – and local – market is increasingly owned by a few big players. And frantic growers face an even greater temptation to illegally leak excess grass across state lines – and into the crosshairs of US attorney general Jeff Sessions’ justice department.“If somebody has got thousands of pounds that they can’t sell, they are desperate,” says Myron Chadowitz, who owns the Eugene farm Cannassentials. “Desperate people do desperate things.”In March, Robin Cordell posted a distress signal on Instagram.“The prices are so low,” she wrote, “and without hustling all day, hoping to find the odd shop with an empty jar, it doesn’t seem to move at any price.”Cordell has a rare level of visibility for a cannabis grower. Her Oregon City farm, Oregon Girl Gardens, received glowing profiles from Dope Magazine and Oregon Leaf. She has 12 years of experience in the medical marijuana system, a plot of family land in Clackamas county, and branding as one of the state’s leaders in organic and women-led cannabis horticulture.She fears she’ll be out of business by the end of the year.“The prices just never went back up,” she says.Cordell ran headlong into Oregon’s catastrophically bountiful cannabis crop.The Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) handed out dozens of licenses to new farmers who planted their first crop last spring. Mild weather blessed the summer of 2017 and stretched generously into the fall. And growers going into their second summer season planted extra seeds to make up for flower lost to a 2016 storm, the last vestige of a brutal typhoon blown across the Pacific from Asia.“That storm naturally constrained the supply even though there were a lot of cultivators,” says Beau Whitney, senior economist for New Frontier Data, which studies the cannabis industry.It kept supply low and prices high in 2017 – even though the state was handing out licenses at an alarming rate.“It was a hot new market,” Whitney says. “There weren’t a whole lot of barriers to entry. The OLCC basically issued a license to anyone who qualified.”Chadowitz blames out-of-state money for flooding the Oregon system. In 2016, state lawmakers decided to lift a restriction that barred out-of-state investors from owning controlling shares of local farms and dispensaries.It was a controversial choice – one that many longtime growers still resent.“The root of the entire thing was allowance of outside money into Oregon,” Chadowitz says. “Anyone could get the money they needed. Unlimited money and unlimited licenses, you’re going to get unlimited flower and crash the market.”As of 1 April, Oregon had licensed 963 recreational cannabis grows, while another 910 awaited OLCC approval.That means oversupply is only going to increase as more farms start harvesting bud.The OLCC has said repeatedly that it has no authority to limit the number of licenses it grants to growers, wholesalers and dispensaries (although by contrast, the number of liquor stores in Oregon is strictly limited).Since voters legalized recreational marijuana in 2014, many industry veterans from the medical marijuana years have chafed at the entrance of new money, warning it would destroy a carefully crafted farm ecosystem.The OLCC remains committed to facilitating a free market for recreational marijuana in which anyone can try their hand at growing or selling.The demand for weed in Oregon is robust – the state reeled in $68m in cannabis sales taxes last year – but it can’t keep pace with supply.Whitney says it’s not unusual for a new industry to attract speculators and people without much business savvy.“Whenever you have these emerging markets, there’s going to be a lot of people entering the market looking for profit,” he says. “Once it becomes saturated, it becomes more competitive. This is not a phenomenon that is unique to cannabis. There used to be a lot of computer companies, but there’s not so many anymore.”Across rolling hills of Oregon farmland and in Portland dispensaries as sleek as designer eyewear shops, the story plays out the same: Business owners can’t make the low prices pencil out.Nick Duyck is a second-generation farmer and owner of 3D Blueberry Farms in Washington county. “I was born and raised on blueberries,” he says.But last June, Duyck launched Private Reserve Cannabis, a weed grow designed to create permanent jobs for seasonal workers.“By starting up the cannabis business,” says Duyck, “it keeps my guys busy on a year-round basis.”He invested $250,000 in the structural build-outs, lighting, environmental controls and other initial costs to achieve a 5,000 sq ft, Tier I, OLCC-approved indoor canopy.Ongoing labor and operational costs added another $20,000 a month.Weed prices were high: Duyck forecast a $1,500 return per pound. If Duyck could produce 20lb of flower a week, he’d make back his money and start banking profits in just three months.October’s bumper crop tore those plans apart.“We got in at the wrong time,” Duyck says. “The outdoor harvest flooded the market.”By the start of the new year, Duyck was sitting on 100lb of ready-to-sell flower – an inventory trickling out to dispensaries in single-pound increments.So he turned to a wholesaler, Cannabis Auctions LLC, which holds monthly fire sales in various undisclosed locations throughout Oregon.Weed auctions operate under a traditional model: sellers submit their wares, and buyers – dispensary owners, intake managers and extract manufacturers – are given an opportunity to inspect products before bidding on parcels awarded to the highest dollar.Duyck sent 60lb of pot to the auction block in December. He had adjusted his expectations downward: he hoped to see something in the ballpark of $400 a pound.It sold for $100 a pound.“The price per pound that it costs us to raise this product is significantly higher than the hundred dollars a pound,” says Duyck. (A little light math points to a $250-per-unit production cost.) “Currently, we’re operating at a $15,000-per-month loss,” Duyck says.If prices don’t improve soon, Duyck says he won’t be able to justify renewing his OLCC license for another year.“The dispensaries that are out there, a lot of them have their own farms, so they don’t buy a lot of product from small farms like us’” Duyck says. “If you really want to grow the product, you almost have to own the store also.”Middlemen – store owners without farms – are also suffering. Take Don Morse, who gave up selling weed on New Year’s Eve.Morse ran Human Collective II, one of the earliest recreational shops in the city, which first opened as a medical marijuana supplier in 2010. At times, Morse stocked 100 strains in his Multnomah Village location.Morse lobbied for legal recreational weed and founded the Oregon Cannabis Business Council.The shift to recreational was costly. With his business partner Sarah Bennett, Morse says he invested more than $100,000 in equipment to meet state regulations.By last summer, new stores were popping up at a rapid pace. Morse’s company wasn’t vertically integrated, which means it did not grow any of its own pot or run a wholesaler that might have subsidized low sales.“Competition around us was fierce, and the company started losing money, and it wasn’t worth it anymore,” Morse says. “At our peak, we had 20 employees. When we closed, we had six.”Morse couldn’t see a way to make the numbers work. Human Collective priced grams as low as $6 to compete with large chains like Nectar and Chalice, but it struggled to turn a profit.“When you’re the little guy buying the product from wholesalers, you can’t afford to compete,” he says. “There’s only so far you can lower the price. There’s too much of everything and too many people in the industry.”So Morse closed his shop: “We paid our creditors and that was that. That was the end of it.”Despite losing his business, Morse stands behind Oregon’s light touch when it comes to regulating the industry.“It’s just commercialism at its finest,” he says. “Let the best survive. That’s just the way it goes in capitalism. That’s just the way it goes.”Just as mom-and-pop grocery stores gave way to big chains, people like Morse are losing out to bigger operations.Chalice Farms has five stores in the Portland area and is opening a sixth in Happy Valley. La Mota has 15 dispensaries. Nectar has 11 storefronts in Oregon, with four more slated to open soon.Despite the record-low prices in the cannabis industry, these chains are hiring and opening new locations, sometimes after buying failed mom-and-pop shops.The home page on Nectar’s website prominently declares: “Now buying dispensaries! Please contact us if you are a dispensary owner interested in selling your business.”Nectar representatives did not respond to a request for comment.Because the federal government does not recognize legal marijuana, the industry cannot access traditional banking systems or even federal courts. That means business owners can’t declare bankruptcy to dissolve a failed dispensary or farm, leaving them with few options. They can try to liquidate their assets, destroy the product they have on hand and eat the losses.Or they can sell the business to a company like Nectar, often for a fraction of what they’ve invested.Deep-pocketed companies can survive the crash and wait for the market to contract again.Oregon faces another consequence of pot businesses closing up shop: leftover weed could end up on the black market.Already, Oregon has a thriving illegal market shipping to other states.US attorney for Oregon, Billy Williams, has said he has little interest in cracking down on legal marijuana businesses, but will prosecute those shipping marijuana to other states.“That kind of thing is what’s going to shut down our industry,” Chadowitz says. “Anything we can do to prevent Jeff Sessions from being right, we have to do.”Ask someone in the cannabis industry what to do about Oregon’s weed surplus, and you’re likely to get one of three answers.The first is to cap the number of licenses awarded by the OLCC. The second is to reduce the canopy size allotted to each license – Massachusetts is trying that. And the last, equally common answer is to simply do nothing. Let the market sort itself out.Farmers, such as Walker of East Fork Cultivars, argue that limiting the number of licensed farms in Oregon would stunt the state’s ability to compete on the national stage in the years ahead.“We’re in this sort of painful moment right now,” says Walker, “but I think if we let it be a painful moment, and not try to cover it up, we’re going to be better off for it.”Walker and other growers hope selling across state lines will someday become legal.Every farmer, wholesaler, dispensary owner and economist WW talked to for this story said that if interstate weed sales became legal, Oregon’s oversupply problem would go away.Under the current presidential administration, that might seem a long shot. But legalization is sweeping the country, Donald Trump is signaling a looser approach, and experts say Oregon will benefit when the feds stop fighting.“The thing about Oregon is that it is known for its cannabis, in a similar way to Oregon pinot noir,” Whitney says. “For those who are able to survive, they are positioned extremely well not only to survive in the Oregon market but also to take advantage of a larger market – assuming things open up on a federal level.”Looking for more great work from the Portland, Oregon, alt-weekly paper and website Willamette Week?

The Boring Company now wants to build a longer “proof of process” tunnel 2.7 miles beneath LA. This could form the backbone of a larger transportation network across the city, called Loop, with electric “skates” whisking people, bikes and cars from station to station at speeds of up to 150mph.The only problem is, Musk’s own Tesla probably won’t be able to fit in it. A 1,600-page document filed with LA city officials specifies the dimensions of the tunnels and the vehicles they could accommodate – and that doesn’t include the Tesla Model S or Model X. A table detailing the operational assumptions of Loop says “D segment car is largest size”. D-segment cars, the European equivalent to an American mid-size, are typically 73in wide. The Model S measures more than 77in and the Model X is wider still. Even the original Tesla Roadster is too broad. Only the Model 3 will likely be able to squeeze underground.The Boring Company told the  that the initial focus of Loop will be transporting people and bicycles, but admitted that there would be a limit on which passenger cars could travel on future versions. A key part of Musk’s plan for his subterranean network is that its tunnels will be much smaller than normal road tunnels, and thus cheaper, easier and quicker to build. “The current standard for a one-lane tunnel is approximately 28ft,” reads the Boring Company’s FAQ. “By placing vehicles on a stabilized electric skate, the diameter can be reduced to less than 14ft. Reducing the diameter in half reduces tunneling costs by 3-4 times.”While the Boring Company awaits permission to start digging its “proof of process” tunnel, it continues to work on the tunnel at the SpaceX campus in Hawthorne. Pictures and videos on its website show a partly constructed tunnel with a large ventilation duct. This tunnel has been inspected at least twice for occupational health and safety, during which it received eight violations and a total of $1,810 in penalties for minor infractions involving walkways, cranes and railings. The company says that none of the violations occurred inside the tunnel itself.Despite its modest achievements to date, the Boring Company is pushing on with more ambitious plans. It is working to get permissions to start digging two tunnels beneath the Baltimore-Washington Parkway to connect the cities, and it has been shortlisted to design, build, finance, operate and maintain a new express link between O’Hare airport and downtown Chicago. That might be later than the famously impatient Musk wants, but could be much sooner than is needed. In April, the mayor of Culver City, where the proof of process tunnel would end up, wrote a letter to his counterpart in Los Angeles. It complained that the project was not clearly defined, used the wrong checklists, and contravened the California Environment Quality Act on several points. It seems like the Boring Company may be doing something even more boring than boring in the months and years ahead – digging its way through a mountain of laws and regulations.

The e has remained, stubbornly, much the way it has since it opened in 1969. There’s neither a cover charge nor fancy cocktails and patrons can help themselves to barbecued chicken and other comfort food for free. In the corner, Samuel Hargress Jr, the 81-year-old owner who lives on the premises, was holding court in a fedora and tweed jacket.“I’m old-old-school. Things are real different now to when I came along,” he said. Since purchasing the bar for $35,000, Hargress has been a central figure in one of New York’s most historic – and rapidly changing – neighbourhoods. Though his establishment maintains a local following, these days it’s famous enough to attract international visitors. “You’ve got people from all over. Everybody here’s partying and dancing. They don’t know each other but it don’t matter.”Harlem’s history has long been marked by waves of new arrivals and change. Over the years, it has been home to everyone from George and Ira Gershwin to Duke Ellington. Before it became a haven for African-American intellectuals, poets and musicians during the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and 30s it was a stronghold of Jewish luminaries, many of whom were displaced by rapid development on the Lower East Side. After a period of decline in the 1970s and 80s, the neighbourhood is once again a hotbed of cultural activity.“It’s an evolving community. I’ve been here since 1980 and it didn’t just change overnight,” says John Reddick. A Harlem historian and preservationist, Reddick leads neighbourhood walking tours.“A lot of tourists have all this baggage and it takes a certain willingness to get beyond that. They think I’m just showing them the nicer side of Harlem, even though these buildings have been here for more than 100 years. I get this all the time: ‘Where in Harlem should you not go?’ There’s nowhere in Harlem I would not go.”Reddick urges visitors and newcomers to make a more meaningful connection with the existing community, whether by visiting a local church or enjoying the free art and live performances at Marcus Garvey park, St Nicholas park and Jackie Robinson recreation centre. Above all, he hopes that everyone who comes gains an appreciation for the neighbourhood’s near-mythic quality and what that has meant for different generations.“Look out of your window and it’s like this Fred Astaire-and-Ginger-Rogers view,” he says. “There’s this exhilaration of being in Harlem this sense that you’re part of this great metropolis. I feel it now, so you can imagine what it must have been like in the 1920s or 30s for somebody such as the poet Langston Hughes.”While there is much that Hughes would still recognise, it is impossible to ignore some of the changes. As with almost any neighbourhood in Manhattan, particularly one marked by handsome, turn-of-the-century brownstones and broad boulevards, Harlem’s property values have skyrocketed, causing residents to question what the future holds. A recent attempt by developers to rebrand the desirable area between 110th Street and 125th Street as SoHa resulted in a backlash by activists. Yet despite the Whole Foods on 125th Street and the queasy spectacle of a townhouse going for more than $4m, Harlem and its cultural institutions have managed to hold on to a distinct identity.“Harlem, throughout all the waves of gentrification and forced migration, has maintained a sense of itself,” says Nico Wheadon, director of public programmes and community engagement at the Studio Museum on 125th Street, which showcases work by African-American artists. “That’s because in its essence, it is an artistic, creative place. There is a history of struggle and protest to maintain that.” As with the National Black Theatre, another important Harlem institution, the Studio Museum turns 50 this year.Some of the efforts to maintain a sense of community have been quieter endeavours such as The Laundromat Project, which provides support for local artists and hosts programmes in laundromats and other public spaces. Another small startup is Hot Bread Kitchen, a non-profit project based in La Marqueta in East Harlem that provides female immigrants facing economic insecurity with a living wage, job training, and support.Meanwhile, the Studio Museum is in the process of redefining itself, moving beyond the walls and connecting with the broader public through art installations in parks and libraries, creative workshops talks, and even dance parties, such as its popular summer series, Uptown Fridays! Though the museum has shut its doors (there are plans to demolish the existing property and rebuild on the same site) it remains an active part of the community, including as its links with El Museo del Barrio, a Spanish Harlem art showcase.As with many Harlem residents, Wheadon finds the neighbourhood fulfils most of her social and entertainment needs. For an evening out, she heads to Vinatería, a stylish Mediterranean spot or 67 Orange Street for cocktails. She’s equally in love with the classics, from the amateur nights at the Apollo Theater to live music at Showman’s Jazz Club (375 West 125th Street), which she says feels “like the Harlem that I imagined before I moved here. It’s a time warp.”Change has, in part, been driven by Harlem’s thriving culinary scene. At its forefront is Marcus Samuelsson, the celebrity chef behind the Red Rooster restaurant, its subterranean sister venue, Ginny’s Supper Club and the Streetbird Rotisserie. Born in Ethiopia and raised in Sweden, Samuelsson spent eight years learning about the neighbourhood prior to opening Red Rooster, attending church events, eating at places such as Silvia’s – a soul-food staple opened in 1962 – and listening to residents.“When you think about the Studio Museum or the National Black Theatre, you’re thinking about this incredible depth of art, of music. We want this to be a destination for food as well,” Samuelsson says. “For me it was about working where you live and creating jobs to restore your community.”Samuelsson’s talk of community is more than lip-service. He works closely with the Careers through Culinary Arts Program, a programme that helps disadvantaged teens enter the restaurant industry and is an integral part of Harlem EatUp!, an annual food festival that highlights both established chefs and small-time food entrepreneurs. Samuelsson respects the older establishments, though he does not view the broader range of options as inherently negative.“You have ramen restaurants now, you have mixologist bars, you have craft coffee and I think that’s great. A community should be able to have both. You want it to be a place where people who live there don’t have to leave to go to a great place,” he says.Likewise, Wheadon feels optimistic that the neighbourhood will continue to hold onto that in the future.“Someone asked me the other day: ‘What is blackness to you?’ I said: ‘It’s celebration.’ I can’t walk to or from work without being swept up in somebody’s something,” she says. “There’s something beautiful about that and I think that Harlem will always have an element of that.”At Paris Blues the scene was certainly one of celebration. As the night wore on, musicians from nearby bars stopped by to jam with the band. Although Hargress is constantly approached with offers from developers, he has no intention of retiring or selling the joint.“I have fun with them. One guy offered me $6m,” he said, adding with unrestrained glee, “So I told him, you come up with $10m, then maybe you can call me back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4785b02799235f69531249977ba6b8a00954f90/0_147_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76988f3b78ac7450d56858c5f7a5027d","title":"michael cohen russia stormy daniels lawyer claim","story":"Michael Avenatti makes extraordinary allegation that Cohen received cash from company affiliated with billionaire linked to Vladimir PutinDonald Trump’s attorney and legal fixer, Michael Cohen, was paid half a million dollars by a company affiliated with a Russian oligarch closely linked to Vladimir Putin, according to extraordinary allegations published on Tuesday.Cohen was said by Avenatti to have received $500,000 through a US affiliate of the Renova investment group owned by Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire closely associated with Putin who was placed under sanction by the US government last month. The payments were allegedly made between January and August 2017.An attorney for the Renova affiliate, Columbus Nova, said it hired Cohen as a business consultant and that Vekselberg had no involvement in the payments. Cohen, his attorney, and the Republican National Committee – for which Cohen is a deputy finance chairman – did not respond to requests for comment.Avenatti’s document said the money was paid to Essential Consultants, the same company Cohen used to pay a $130,000 settlement to buy Clifford’s silence in October 2016. The document said Essential also received funds from other major companies, some of which had business before the federal government. AT\u0026ampT, the telecoms corporation, confirmed it had made payments to Cohen’s firm during 2017 for “insights into understanding the new administration”. Novartis, a Swiss-based pharmaceuticals firm, did not dispute that it paid Cohen. Vekselberg has reportedly been interviewed by investigators working for Robert Mueller, the special counsel looking into alleged collusion between Russia and Trump’s team during the 2016 election campaign. Vekselberg has not been accused of any wrongdoing. CNN subsequently reported on Tuesday that he was specifically asked by Mueller’s investigators about the alleged payments to Cohen.The 61-year-old oligarch amassed a fortune through his Renova conglomerate, which s energy, heavy industry and finance, probably making him Russia’s ninth-richest person. He has remained in the Kremlin’s favour and was last year given a state honour by Putin.Vekselberg was also a guest at a now notorious December 2015 dinner in Moscow celebrating the RT television channel, which was attended by Putin and Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser.Columbus Nova is described on its website as “the US investment vehicle for the Renova Group”. The company’s chief executive, Andrew Intrater, contributed $250,000 to Trump’s presidential inauguration fund in January last year and a further $35,000 to Trump’s re-election fund in June last year.It was not clear from Avenatti’s document whether these contributions were connected to the new allegations. Intrater did not respond to an email asking whether the allegations were accurate.An attorney for Columbus Nova, Richard Owens, said in an email that the company was owned by Americans and that Vekselberg had no involvement in the payments to Cohen. “After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures,” said Owens. Avenatti asserted that Cohen also collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees from corporate clients. AT\u0026ampT was said to have paid Cohen’s firm $200,000 in four monthly installments from October 2017. Trump’s administration was at the time considering whether to allow an $85bn merger of AT\u0026ampT and Time Warner, which it has since rejected. In an emailed statement, AT\u0026ampT said: “Essential Consultants was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration. They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017.”Avenatti said that a subsidiary of Novartis paid Cohen’s company almost $400,000 “in late 2017 and early 2018”. Novartis’s incoming chief executive, Vas Narasimhan, was one of several businesspeople invited to dinner with Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on 25 January.A spokesman for Novartis said in an email: “Any agreements with Essential Consultants were entered before our current CEO taking office in February of this year and have expired.”Avenatti has become one of the most publicly visible foes of Trump and Cohen since being recruited to represent Clifford in the fallout of the payoff and secrecy agreement arranged by Cohen being publicly revealed. Clifford has filed civil lawsuits against Trump and Cohen.Avenatti told the  last weekend, without offering any new evidence, that he believed Trump would have to resign from the presidency: “I firmly believe there is going to be too much evidence of wrongdoing by him and those around him for him to be able to survive the balance of his term.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d923a1b967a417403fea3166a84a4b4adfdbeac/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3baa62f4a694f58c753f9f72a9dfd80","title":"hawaiis kilauea volcano erupts in pictures","story":"The eruption of Kilauea volcano has sent lava flowing into residential areas on Hawaii’s Big Island, with residents ordered to abandon their homes.

According to the semi-official Fars news agency, the commander, Mohammad Ali Jafari said: “I congratulate and take into a good deed the vicious withdrawal of the US from JCPOA, which was not credible even before the withdrawal … It was proved once more that US isn’t trustworthy in regards its commitments.”At the opening session of the Iranian parliament on Wednesday, a group of hardline MPs held up a paper US flag and the text of the 2015 landmark nuclear deal, also known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), before setting fire to both while chanting “death to America”.The MPs’ protest, which came a day after the US president broke with European allies over what he said was a “horrible, one-sided” agreement, was a nod to the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who had said in June 2016, prior to Trump’s election, that if the Americans “tear it up, we will set it on fire”.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.Ali Larijani, the speaker of the parliament, said Tehran would wait to gauge how the Europeans partners in the nuclear talks would handle the US exit from the deal. His comments echoed those of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who has said the agreement could survive if Europe defies Trump.“Europe must prove that it is capable of throwing its weight behind settling our issues,” Larijani told MPs on Wednesday, according to the Mehr news agency. “The American nation has been saddled with an egotistical and amateurish politician.”Larijani said Trump was overjoyed that he was “plundering some short-sighted regional countries” – a reference to Israel and Saudi Arabia – “for the price of ignoring their wicked actions in the region”.The US exit from the agreement dominated Wednesday’s newspaper front pages in Tehran. “Barjam minus America,” read the main headline on the front page of the reformist Ebtekar daily, referring to the Persian acronyms for the JCPOA. “US exit from Barjam puts an end to the the world’s trust in the empire of lies,” Etelaaat’s front page said. “Trump tore up the agreement, now it’s time for us to set it on fire,” read the front page headline of Kayhan, an ultra-conservative daily whose editor is appointed directly by the supreme leader. Rouhani delivered a speech on Tuesday night shortly after Trump’s announcement, indicating that Tehran was waiting to see Europe’s response before making a decision on how to handle the US exit.Despite Rouhani’s assurances that Iran was prepared to withstand the impact of a US exit, Trump’s decision has revived worries of conflict inside Iran, where people are concerned about the state of its already fragile economy, and consequences for the fate of reformists who had championed the nuclear deal.Ordinary Iranians were on tenterhooks on Tuesday night ahead of Trump’s announcement, monitoring the developments closely, particularly any immediate impact on the country’s national currency, prompting panic-buying of hard-to-find dollars amid political uncertainty. Trump’s decision to reimpose economic sanctions is likely to exacerbate Iran’s economic problems at a time when public discontent is rife. In January, protests over economic grievances spread to as many as 80 cities, taking on a political dimension. Sadeq Zibakalam, a prominent political commentator and professor of politics at Tehran University, struck a pessimistic tone about the consequences of Trump’s decision in Iran.“Many people are worried about war,” he told the  by phone from Tehran. “Whenever the country faces a crisis in its foreign policy or economy, the situation gets better for hardliners, they’d be able to exert their force more easily.” Foad Izadi, a Tehran-based conservative political analyst, said Trump’s aim was to confront Iran with greater force but that it could withstand the pressure. “For 40 years, we have been living under sanctions. The collapse of the nuclear deal will mean that we have to find ways to circumvent sanctions, something we have done in the past. The institutions that have been doing that now need to be re-equipped,” he said.For ordinary Iranians, however, the prospects are gloomy. Arash Tavanafar said the psychological pressure of Trump’s decision on the Iranian population was much bigger than its economic effect. “The psychological pressure and worry is destroying us, especially the youth, because we neither have any trust on this political system, nor any hope for its reform. We’ve only become spectators of its downfall.” A 17-year-old Iranian active on the Telegram social app, which has recently been blocked, said the outcome would harm Rouhani, who was re-elected in a landslide by 24m votes last year mainly because of his efforts to secure the deal. “The psychological impact is bigger, people are worried, they’re afraid about war and they’re tired of instability and being in limbo.”It’s hard to overstate the power of Telegram in Iran. Of its 80m population, an estimated 40m use the free app created by Russian national Pavel Durov. Its clients share videos and photos, subscribing to groups where everyone from politicians to poets broadcast to fellow users.While authorities ban social media websites like Facebook and Twitter and censor others, Telegram users can say nearly anything. In the last presidential election, the app played a big role in motivating turnout and spreading political screeds.Telegram touts itself as being highly encrypted and allows users to set their messages to “self-destruct” after a certain period, making it a favourite among activists and others concerned about their privacy. That too has made it a worry of Iranian authorities.A channel run by an exiled journalist, Roohallah Zam, helped organise some of those who took to the street, including times and locations for protests, and was suspended by Durov after Iranian authorities complained that it was inciting violence.Zam, who denies the allegations, responded by launching new channels to spread messages about upcoming protests before the government ordered the app shut down.\u0026nbspMohammad, a postdoctoral student, said Trump’s decision would undermine moderates in Iran as the country might have to name a new supreme leader in the coming years. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is 78, and there has been speculation over his health. “Moderates can play a significant role in the appointment of the new leader if they’re not weakened, something that can hugely affect the future generations in the country,” Mohammad said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b54ec342f1b435142013b08d1e6527ecbddae62/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3589e7eca852c34810d877e001579ff9","title":"israel orders human rights watch representative to leave","story":"Omar Shakir, a US citizen, denies the accusation that he supports a boycott against IsraelIsrael’s interior ministry has ordered the representative of Human Rights Watch in the country to leave within 14 days, accusing him of supporting a boycott against Israel.Human Rights Watch, a New York-based rights organisation, said the decision showed Israel was seeking to suppress criticism of its human rights record, and that it would challenge the decision in court. Omar Shakir, the group’s Israel and Palestine Director, holds US citizenship. He has denied the accusation against him. Israel last year initially denied Shakir a work permit, in a move criticised by the US. It later granted him a one-year work visa. Israeli interior minister Aryeh Deri said he had acted on the recommendation of Gilad Erdan, the minister for strategic affairs, whose department said it gathered data that Shakir had for years supported a boycott of Israel. “It is inconceivable that a boycott activist can receive a permit to remain in Israel so that he can act in every possible way against the state. I will use all means to expel such people from the country,” Deri’s statement said. But Shakir said: “I have not called for any form of boycott of Israel during my time at Human Rights Watch and the interior ministry acknowledged this in its letter to me ... in which they informed me of their decision to deny an extension to my work visa.” HRW said it supported Shakir. “This is not about Shakir, but rather about muzzling Human Rights Watch and shutting down criticism of Israel’s rights record,” its program director, Iain Levine, said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a29d6e8f7421dab51ef9ad6aba7fa6e602e37257/0_29_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=177c4ae3c17018980111b20218dc899a","title":"russia shows off new missiles and jets in victory day parade red square","story":"Israeli PM among guests at Red Square parade marking second world war anniversaryRussia has showcased some of its most advanced weaponry, including nuclear missiles, during a military parade on Red Square in honour of the 1945 victory over Nazi Germany.“Peace is very fragile,” Vladimir Putin said at the start of the annual parade, which also featured a flypast by Russia’s new SU-57 stealth fighter, recently deployed to Syria.Around 27 million Soviet soldiers and citizens died in the second world war, and the annual Victory Day event is one of the country’s biggest public holidays. In recent years, critics have accused the Kremlin of using the holiday to push an aggressive form of nationalism.Other military hardware on show included Russia’s new hypersonic missile, known as the Kinzhal, which Putin recently described as “invincible”, and the YARS ballistic missile, which can carry 10 nuclear warheads over a range of up to 7,500 miles. Russia also showed off its Uran-9 remote-controlled light tank and advanced S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems.Among the few foreign guests at the parade was the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is due to hold talks with Putin on military coordination after airstrikes in Syria overnight that were blamed on Israel.Nine people were killed when missiles hit depots and rocket launchers that probably belonged to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in Kisweh, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. Netanyahu said before his trip to Moscow: “In light of what is currently happening in Syria, it is necessary to ensure continued coordination” between the Russian and Syria militaries. He made no mention of the overnight strikes.Tensions between Israel and Iran are high as Tehran attempts to expand its military operations in Syria, where it supports President Bashar al-Assad. Donald Trump’s announcement on Tuesday that the US would break the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran has triggered uncertainty and threatened to spark more unrest in the Middle East.Russia has promised to supply Syria with air defence systems, most likely S-300 surface-to-air missiles.Israel has carried out dozens of bombing raids against Syrian targets since the civil war began in 2011, and has pledged to target Russian-supplied anti-aircraft systems if they are deployed against Israeli jets. “If someone fires on our planes, we will destroy them,” Israel’s defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said last month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf0494d0272fef2a74cf52e91f5cbf24471deb74/0_89_4480_2687/master/4480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d55b29567124eea63bb00e06fcb782e0","title":"settlement in abdul hakim belhaj rendition case to be announced","story":"Dissident who was kidnapped and sent to Libyan prison had insisted upon an apologyA legal settlement in the long-running rendition case involving the Libyan dissident Abdul-Hakim Belhaj is expected to be announced in parliament on Thursday.Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, were kidnapped in Bangkok in 2004 after cooperation between the CIA and MI6.

Labour peers were whipped to abstain on the amendment concerning the European economic area. But 83 defied the whip, including a former party leader, many former ministers and a former chief whip. They were joined by 17 Conservatives.The amendment on remaining in the European economic area (EEA) will now have to be considered and voted on by MPs when the bill returns to the Commons, perhaps as soon as next week. The Tories are likely to try to brand Labour as the party of free movement, which is one of the obligations of EEA membership. But the Labour MP Chuka Umunna said: “The time for constructive ambiguity is over – our members and our voters will be delighted with this clear signal that we will not go along with this Tory Brexit.”There was some good news for Theresa May. Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, two key remainers, have signalled they might support the PM’s idea of a “customs partnership” with the EU. Soubry said: “If it delivers the huge benefit of our membership of the customs union and indeed the single market … then I don’t care what you call it.”‘Psychological war’ – World leaders have reacted with dismay after Donald Trump went through with his threat to break with the Iran nuclear agreement, also known as the JCPOA. The US will now reimpose sanctions on companies that do business with Tehran. Here’s how the deal works and why Trump has decided to sabotage it – in what Barack Obama, one of its authors, called a “misguided” act and a “serious mistake”. Iran said the accord is well rid of the “pesky being”, ie Trump, but Iran’s president has warned that the country’s atomic agency is preparing to restart uranium enrichment if the deal collapses completely. European leaders appear determined to salvage the agreement. “We urge the US to ensure that the structures of the JCPOA can remain intact, and to avoid taking action which obstructs its full implementation by all other parties to the deal,” said a statement from France, Germany and the UK. Trump’s action also imperils the prospects of freedom for American nationals held by Iran.Quick catch-up – Here’s where things stand in the middle part of the week.\u0026gt North Korea might be about to release three US nationals it imprisoned for alleged anti-government activities. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, is back in the country to lay groundwork for a summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump.\u0026gt The lawyer for Stormy Daniels says Donald Trump’s lawyer, who channelled “hush money” to the adult film actor, got half a million dollars from a Russian oligarch and Putin ally.\u0026gt The Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski is suing the Academy over his expulsion and says the MeToo movement is founded on “hypocrisy” and “mass hysteria”.\u0026gt Fewer people would drink so much if alcohol came with a warning that it increases the risk of cancer, a survey has found.\u0026gt Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter have signed on to turn the adventures of Bill and Ted into a trilogy.

The “digital wellbeing” suite for Android includes time limits on app usage, a “wind down” mode to silence alerts at the end of the day, and a “shush” feature putting the phone on do-not-disturb when it is placed face down. “People struggle to be truly present because notifications on the device can be too distracting,” said the Google chief executive, Sundar Pichai. You tuned out a bit and started fiddling with your phone when he said “truly present” didn’t you?While the “yes” and “no” placards for the abortion referendum may be up, the people of Roscommon, the only Irish constituency that voted against same-sex marriage, are keeping their views close, writes Harriet Sherwood. Whether to amend the constitution and allow legal abortion remains isive in rural Ireland, as an issue cutting to the core of Catholic belief. But demographic change and the declining influence of the church also have a bearing.In Roscommon, canvassers for the “yes” campaign say they have found people fairly evenly ided between yes, no and undecided. Nationally, yes is expected to win – though, says one doorknocker, “there is a wide expectation that Roscommon will vote no”. On the other side, campaigners feel the prospect of abortion on demand up to 12 weeks will shock people into voting no: “Many ordinary people feel that an equal voice has not been given to those who want to retain the eighth amendment.” Voting takes place on 25 May.

Ninety-five per cent of schools are not over subscribed.“The Minister announced he is building 16 new schools.

Photograph: The The Government is planning to remove the “Baptism barrier” for entry to Catholic primary schools from September of next year.Under changes to be announced on Wednesday, all Catholic primary schools will be prohibited from giving enrolment priority to baptised children in cases where they are over-subscribed.The vast majority of primary schools – just over 90 per cent – are of a Catholic ethos.However, minority faiths, such as the Church of Ireland, will be allowed to prioritise members of their religion in order to protect their ethos in cases where they are over-subscribed.This exclusion has been introduced to help ensure children of minority faiths can still access a school of their own religion.The new rules will apply to over-subscribed schools (about 20 per cent) only. Schools that are not oversubscribed will be obliged to accept all applicants, regardless of religion.Minister for Education Richard Bruton said the “historic” move aimed to balance the rights of non-denominational, Catholic and minority faith families.“It is unfair that a local child of no religion is passed over in favour of a child of religion, living some distance away, for access to their local school,” Mr Bruton said. “Parents should not feel pressured to baptise their child to get access to their local school.”Mr Bruton said he planned to enacted the School Admissions Bill as quickly as possible, so it would apply to children entering school in the 20192020 school year.While Mr Bruton announced the plans last year, the planned amendment has been subject to extensive legal advice from the Attorney General’s office.The  reported earlier this year that Catholic bishops and trustee bodies for thousands of Catholic schools, along with management bodies and missionary groups, were preparing to fight the changes through legal challenges. They have argued that the planned changes are unfair and mean that some Catholic children may now be denied places in their local Catholic school.Government sources, however, say they are satisfied the planned changes are “legally robust”.Mr Bruton has argued that Catholic children will still be able to access Catholic primary schools given that the majority – 90 per cent – provide for religious instruction or education through the faith.Other significant changes to the legislation, which seeks to provide a fairer admissions policy, include:* A provision to allow all-Irish primary and secondary schools to give enrolment priority to Irish-speaking children. Under this approach, parents will be required to provide evidence that their child has an “age appropriate” level of fluency. Parents will have a choice to demonstrate this through an interview at the school or via a video.* New powers for the Minister for Education to require schools to open special classes for children with special needs where it is deemed necessary. At present, there are no powers to compel schools to establish special classes. However, research suggests some schools erect “soft barriers” to discourage children with additional needs from applying.Mr Bruton said the changes were aimed at introducing a more “parent-friendly, equitable and consistent” approach to how school admissions policies operate for the 4,000 State-recognised schools across the country."},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg   May 9, 2018TV presenter moves to clarify controversial remarks made on his Sunday programme "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3488930.1525845159!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"iranian politicians torch us flag in parliament","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Iranian president Hassan Rouhani addresses the nation in a televised speech in Tehran, Iran.

Photograph: Jonathan ErnstReuters US president Donald Trump defied international allies and announced America’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement on Tuesday, unravelling years of international diplomacy and plunging the wider Middle East region into uncertainty.Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump announced that America would withdraw from the agreement, denouncing the nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama and six other countries as “defective at its core”.While allies had hoped that Mr Trump might embrace some form of incremental withdrawal, he instead announced that America would begin reinstating sanctions that were waived under the 2015 deal and impose new economic sanctions on Iran.The US treasury department was on Tuesday night due to announce a “wind-down” period for companies affected by the current sanctions, ranging from 90 days to six months. But the impact of the US withdrawal was expected to be immediately felt on the global trading system as companies and oil markets absorb the news.“The fact is this was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never ever been made. It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will,” Mr Trump said as he announced the US withdrawal from the agreement, which aimed to restrict Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for the easing of sanctions on the Iranian economy.In a televised address following the announcement, Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani said he had directed his officials to continue to negotiate with Russia, China and the European signatories of the deal about remaining in the agreement.But he warned that Iran would “start enriching uranium more than before” and within a few weeks if the negotiations do not yield concrete results.The leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom issued a joint statement expressing their “regret and concern” over the decision.Noting that the JCPOA was unanimously endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, they said the resolution “remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear programme”.Speaking in Brussels, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the EU was “determined to preserve” the agreement. “The nuclear deal is not a bilateral agreement,” she said. “And it’s not in the hands of any single country to terminate it unilaterally.”In a show of solidarity, European officials met with Iran’s deputy foreign minister for political affairs in Brussels in the hours before the announcement from Washington.In a rare public comment on a policy of his successor, former president Barack Obama issued a statement describing the decision as a “serious mistake”.“The JPCOA is working – that is a view shared by European allies, independent experts and the current US secretary of defence. The JCPOA is in America’s interests – it has significantly rolled back Iran’s nuclear programme.”Noting that it was a model for “what diplomacy can accomplish”, Mr Obama said that the agreement’s inspections and verification regime were “precisely what the United States should be working to put in place in North Korea”.As Mr Trump announced the US withdrawal from the agreement, he revealed that secretary of state Mike Pompeo was on his way to North Korea ahead of a planned summit between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un.It is expected that Mr Pompeo may return with three American detainees who are being held in North Korea.

The bands on all three rings are diamond-encrusted.A vivid yellow cushion-shaped diamond ring encased in smaller oval and round-shaped diamondsAn emerald-cut diamond ring with purple and pink stones, and four pear-shaped diamondsLast year Scotland Yard issued pictures of two men they said they wanted to question in connection with the raid, but they have now said they believe one of the men is Osmakcic, and they have reissued his picture in a fresh attempt to solve the case.Detective Sergeant Chris Taylor, of Kensington and Chelsea CID, said: This was a well-planned and audacious theft committed in the middle of a busy art fair.We are re-releasing the image of Mr Osmakcic in an attempt to trace him. It is highly likely that Mr Osmakcic may be out of the UK, possibly in Europe.He may also be known by the following name Vinko Tomic or Juro Markelic.DS Taylor added: I am asking anyone who knows his whereabouts to contact police or Crimestoppers so we can bring him to justice.Vinko Osmakcic AKA Juro Markelic was arrested in Las Vegas The Pink Panther gang has been linked to a string of audacious raids around the globe dating back to the early 1990s, when they were thought to operate out of Japan.In 1992 they were suspected of stealing a diamond worth half a million pounds from an international jewellery show in Hong Kong.But they were also linked to similar raids in Thailand, Japan, Switzerland, Germany, Monaco and Hawaii.The Graff jewellery store in Mayfair was targeted by the Pink Panther gangIn 2003 the gang was thought to have pulled off a £23 million raid at the Graff jewellery store in London.In 2010 Osmakcic, who is described as speaking in heavily accented English, was suspected of being part of a gang of four who stole a necklace worth £1 million from a jewellery store in Las Vegas.Seven months later Osmakcic was arrested after being spotted by an undercover officer at a jewellery trade fair in Las Vegas.He was charged with theft, but maintained his innocence claiming he was a self employed chef with an income of a £1,000 a month.In March 2004 he pleaded guilty to theft and after cutting a deal with prosecutors was sentenced to one year in prison.But wanted for a string of other offences, the authorities in California applied for his extradition, where he was charged with the theft of a £35,000 worth of gems.He again pleaded guilty but while he was serving his sentence became the subject of an extradition application from the authorities in Hawaii.Vinko Osmakcic AKA Juro Markelic was arrested in Monaco in 2009As part of his defence, Osmakcic claimed he had been a soldier in the Bosnian war, but had turned to crime in order to support his displaced family.In a letter to the judge, he wrote: In 1992 my village was attacked and fully destroyed. Everybody from my family was in the street overnight.The only hope I had was to leave my country and do whatever it took to help my family survive … I am not looking for any excuses for what I did. I just wanted to explain my wrongful doings … I hope you honor may understand my situation.In 2006 he was sentenced to 21 months in Hawaii, but was released eight months late, with his lawyer insisting it was highly unlikely he will need to commit other crimes.Three years later he was detained in Monaco on suspicion of casing out a jewellery store.  At the time he was wearing a watch worth an estimated £160,000.He was jailed in Monaco, but was released several months later and subsequently disappeared.Law and orderChina builds system that can predict earthquakes \u0026#39three weeks in advance\u0026#39Crufts judge accused of failing to control dogs after her deerhound \u0026#39grabs Chihuahua in its mouth\u0026#39Mike Pompeo calls North Korean leader \u0026#39Chairman Un\u0026#39 in diplomatic faux pas ahead of Pyongyang visitNew outbreak of Ebola kills 17 in Democratic Republic of Congo Kim Jong-un leads the diplomatic dance on the Korean Peninsula, but the failure of the Iran deal could imperil negotiations Father punched after spying on daughter\u0026#39s kiss at party using app linked to CCTVVE Day 2018: How the  covered Victory in Europe Day in 1945 \u0026#39Race against time\u0026#39 to curb cholera outbreak in YemenDebbie Abrahams sacked from Labour\u0026#39s shadow cabinet after \u0026#39bullying\u0026#39 probeComment: Iran\u0026#39s aggression, not Donald Trump\u0026#39s, has sundered the nuclear dealBaldness cure could come from side-effect of cancer drugSeries of blasts hit Kabul as suicide bombers and gunmen attack Afghanistan\u0026#39s capital The untold story behind the priceless Rockefeller art collection, set to be the largest art auction in history How It Is (Part One), Print Room, review - ingenious adaptation brings out the pathos in BeckettWho are the Americans imprisoned by Pyongyang who could be released to smooth US-North Korea relations?Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Ex-SAS boss who led British hunt for Osama bin Laden is appointed as new Army chief World\u0026#39s first wax figure of Meghan Markle unveiled at Madame TussaudsDonald Trump announces \u0026#39withdrawal\u0026#39 from Iran nuclear dealFury as supermarket petrol stations introduce £99 fuel \u0026#39deposit\u0026#39 to pay at the pump We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/09/TELEMMGLPICT000162714592_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdIenvPtNEuAY91hNfGZ-Ij4rKO4wB9NPod8uWCSpk3A.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"mike pompeo calls north korean leader chairman un diplomatic","story":"Mike Pompeo, Kim Jong-un and Donald TrumpUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to have made a diplomatic faux pas and referred to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as \u0027Chairman Un\u0027 ahead of a visit to Pyongyang on Wednesday.Washington\u0027s top diplomat said the US was beginning to put some outlines around the substance of the agenda for the summit between the President (Trump) and Chairman Un.Mr Pompeo faced a backlash on Twitter due to the mistake, which was revealed in the official transcript of his comments to reporters on board his plane to Asia.Somebody really needs to have a word with Secretary of State Pompeo before he meets anybody in North Korea, wrote Twitter user Alistair Coleman.He just referred to Kim Jong-un as “Chairman Un”. That’s like, I dunno, calling Winston Churchill “Prime Minister Spencer”.It is not the first time that embarrassing errors have appeared in official White House material.Last year Xi Jinping, the president of China, was referred to as the president of the Republic of China - the official name for Taiwan.The White House press office also incorrectly referred to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as “President Abe of Japan” during the G20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany.However, Donald Trump, the US President, did correctly refer to the leader of Japan as prime minster during his remarks at the summit.Mr Pompeo\u0027s trip is his second to Pyongyang, and comes ahead of a summit between Mr Trump and Kim in coming weeks.North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (R) shakes hands with the former CIA Director, now US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo in Pyongyang in April. Although some may have seen Mr Pompeo’s slip as a sign of lack of preparedness for his trip to North Korea, others believe it may be due to an error from the White House official responsible for transcribing the remarks.The family name appears at the start of the full name in many Asian countries, while the given name appears at the end.Please review our commenting policyMary Berry salad dressings recalled due to undeclared egg China builds system that can predict earthquakes \u0026#39three weeks in advance\u0026#39Crufts judge accused of failing to control dogs after her deerhound \u0026#39grabs Chihuahua in its mouth\u0026#39New outbreak of Ebola kills 17 in Democratic Republic of Congo Kim Jong-un leads the diplomatic dance on the Korean Peninsula, but the failure of the Iran deal could imperil negotiations Father punched after spying on daughter\u0026#39s kiss at party using app linked to CCTVVE Day 2018: How the  covered Victory in Europe Day in 1945 \u0026#39Race against time\u0026#39 to curb cholera outbreak in YemenDebbie Abrahams sacked from Labour\u0026#39s shadow cabinet after \u0026#39bullying\u0026#39 probeComment: Iran\u0026#39s aggression, not Donald Trump\u0026#39s, has sundered the nuclear dealBaldness cure could come from side-effect of cancer drugSeries of blasts hit Kabul as suicide bombers and gunmen attack Afghanistan\u0026#39s capital The untold story behind the priceless Rockefeller art collection, set to be the largest art auction in history How It Is (Part One), Print Room, review - ingenious adaptation brings out the pathos in BeckettWho are the Americans imprisoned by Pyongyang who could be released to smooth US-North Korea relations?Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Ex-SAS boss who led British hunt for Osama bin Laden is appointed as new Army chief World\u0026#39s first wax figure of Meghan Markle unveiled at Madame TussaudsDonald Trump announces \u0026#39withdrawal\u0026#39 from Iran nuclear dealFury as supermarket petrol stations introduce £99 fuel \u0026#39deposit\u0026#39 to pay at the pump We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"mohammed kozbar libel settlement","story":"Mr Mohammed Kozbar issued a libel claim in relation to an article published on 13 March 2016 headed “Corbyn and the mosque leader who blames the UK for Isil”.

and analysts warned the proposed Sainsbury’s-Asda merger could make things worse for the group. The company reported a 1.3 per cent increase in like-for-like sales in the 18 weeks to 5 May 2018. However, the group added that it experienced a challenging trading environment in March and April, and blamed a drop in footfall and weeks of poor weather during that period, which led to the closure of some stores. As a result, although transaction values continued to grow, the number of transactions taking place fell. Greggs driver hands out free food to stranded drivers on motorwayGreggs profits rise on back of new store openings Greggs offers sit-down candle-lit dinners for Valentine\u0027s DayMike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, noted that Greggs said sales had struggled due to lower footfall and poor weather, but did not link the two reasons. “This suggests underlying weakness in demand for its offering, something management echoes by way of a still cautious full year outlook,” he said.“In fact, today’s share price reaction suggests shareholders interpreting guidance for ‘underlying profit at a similar level to last year’ as implying a real possibility that it comes in below.”Mr van Dulken added: “Greggs’ message only adds to a grim flow of news from the UK high street. Consumer confidence was already waning ahead of Brexit and what was a potential rate hike (no longer), hurting retail zone footfall, before inclement weather blew in to make matters worse and dent full year expectations.”He also warned that price competition for on-to-go food could also step up a gear if the Sainsbury’s-Asda deal gets the green light and the new, combined supermarket group slashes prices by 10 per cent as promised. Meanwhile, the group said sales of its healthier options continue to grow, but also announced that it planned to extend its value meal deals offer. “Greggs is clearly doing well with hot drinks and hot savoury items, as it has done for a long time, but the jury is still out on whether introducing the likes of ‘feta and beetroot dip with grains and lemon salad’ is a step too far,” said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. “The idea of reinventing itself to a ‘food-to-go’ chain has been in motion for some time and the business has seen success with more mainstream items like lower calorie wraps and porridge.“However, there is a danger that Greggs’ transformation is happening at the wrong time with consumers increasingly cautious about how they spend money. That may explain why Greggs has now flagged that it will be extending its value meal deals offer.”Greggs said sales in May have started more strongly than in the previous two months, but added: “Given the uncertainties over market footfall we are cautious in respect of the outlook for sales in the balance of the year.”The group said: “We are well positioned to compete for sales in the months ahead with the launch of our new summer menu featuring new sandwiches and salads and we will be extending our offer of value meal deals.  Costs are being controlled tightly with food input cost inflation easing in line with our expectations, and we expect this trend to continue. “Taking into account trading conditions in the year to date, and our more cautious outlook, we currently believe that underlying profits for the year are likely to be at a similar level to last year.”beast from the eastor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It takes the huge amount of information being published to the web and organises it into stories that readers might be interested in, using machine learning to understand what stories are about and the vast amount of information it stores about people to guess what they might be interested in.The reimagined Google News uses a new set of AI techniques to take a constant flow of information as it hits the web, analyze it in real time and organize it into storylines, wrote Google News boss Trystan Upstill in a blog post. This approach means Google News understands the people, places and things involved in a story as it evolves, and connects how they relate to one another.Google founder warns of AI’s ‘sci-fi style sentience’ potentialAt its core, this technology lets us synthesize information and put it together in a way that helps you make sense of what’s happening, and what the impact or reaction has been.As well as using AI to understand stories, the new Google News will try to ensure that people get the information they want to read about, too. Just like with services such as YouTube, the site will have a special For You section that shows people what it thinks they want to read.We start with a briefing of five stories that Google News has organized for you—a mix of the most important headlines, local news and the latest developments on the topics you’re interested in, wrote Mr Upstill. And the more you use the app, the better the app gets. We’ve also built easy-to-use and easy-to-access controls so you can decide if you want to see more or less of a topic or publisher.As well as the features for reading, Google claims the new app and service will allow people to find and support the websites and news publishers they want to read. As well as being able to follow specific publications, it will also be easy to subscribe to specific publishers.The new version of Google News replaces Google Play Newstand on mobile and desktop and the Google News \u0026amp Weather mobile app, too.

Had we relied on these mouse research concepts, we would have been barking up the wrong tree.”Additional reporting by PAor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The lowest regional support is in the ConnaughtUlster statistical region, at 89 per cent – still an overwhelming figure.  Maybe the Irish should leave the EU87 per cent of those polled believed Ireland had on balance benefited from EU membership, with just 10 per cent disagreeing. Unemployed people were less likely to agree, however, at 70 per cent.Smaller majorities of people supported Ireland contributing more to the EU budget and joining in a future EU defence and security union.Noelle O’Connell, executive director of European Movement Ireland, which commissioned the poll, said: “People are very clear that leaving the EU would not be in Ireland’s interests. However, there is understandable uncertainty about what changes Brexit will bring to Ireland, the border and the Ireland-UK trade relationship in the long term.“Contrary to recent claims, at 92 per cent support for Ireland’s membership of the EU remains strong in fact it is at an all-time high since we first undertook this poll in 2013.”In August 2017 Nigel Farage urged Ireland to leave the EU. “Maybe the best thing for Ireland given that she’s stuck in the wrong currency, given that nearly all of her overseas business is denominated in dollars or sterling, maybe the Irish should leave the EU and then we could then work out our own terms between us,” he said. Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Sales dropped by 3.1 per cent compared with April last year, the sharpest decline recorded by the BRC and KPMG since they began monitoring retail performance in 1995. While the figure for last month was affected by the early timing of Easter this year - with shoppers doing more buying in March, ahead of the spring holiday - economists still deemed the data a “weak report”. Sharp drop in retail job vacancies as high street crisis deepensFive things that show how online retailing will transform our lives“It is extremely rare for total sales to fall outright December 2008 was the last time our calendar-adjusted measure of total sales fell for two consecutive months,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Continued weakness in sales in April can’t be pinned on the weather - average temperatures actually were 1.1 degrees celsius above their 1970-2017 April average - or any other one-offs.”Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said consumers\u0027 discretionary spending power remains under pressure and added: “The reality is, that with only a gradual return to solid growth in real incomes expected, the market environment is likely to remain extremely challenging for most retailers.However, Mr Tombs warned: “The widely anticipated revival in growth in consumers’ spending is not emerging this year. While wages are no longer falling in real terms, households’ incomes were hit in April by another round of austerity measures and a rise in minimum pension contributions. “In addition, the rise in (interest rates) in November has prompted households to take a more cautious approach to borrowing and has hit the housing market hard, depressing consumers’ confidence.” Pantheon Macroeconomics is predicting that households’ real spending growth will slow to 0.8 per cent in 2018, down from 1.7 per cent last year.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The arrests were often violent, and sometimes with the support of unofficial vigilante forces. Police released Mr Navalny later that evening, but many of his supporters remained in custody throughout the inauguration. Today’s ceremony mainly followed the protocol of previous years, but there were departures. The major innovation was the debut of Mr Putin’s new 12.5bn ruble limousine, the “Kortezh”. But the car would not sweep through central Moscow as six years ago. The image of a depopulated city centre on lockdown that day left an awkward aftertaste, and today there would be no repeat.Instead, Mr Putin’s new limousine made the short trip from his Kremlin offices to the ceremonial halls. Key Putin opponent among hundreds arrested in violent Moscow clashesTrump targets Russian oligarchs and Putin allies in fresh US sanctionsDonald Trump suggested meeting Vladimir Putin at the White HouseTrump ‘tells Vladimir Putin: “If there is an arms race, ‘I’ll win’”Inside, dignitaries included some of Mr Putin’s closest friends, like the former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and American actor Steven Seagal. There were the stars of Russia’s beau monde – from film director Nikita Mikhalkov to rapper Timati. And there was a mix of the stranger symbols of Mr Putin’s rule: biker Alexander Zaldostanov, aka “the surgeon” the uber-loyal head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill and the tsar-worshipping, ultra-conservative Natalia Poklonskaya. Pro-Kremlin youth and the heads of the regional electoral commission were also on the guest list. These groups were the sergeants of March’s presidential elections, considered a great success. That vote returned Mr Putin with a 77 per cent share, and proved to be a disaster for the liberal opposition. Looking relaxed, contented, and not without swagger, Mr Putin delivered a short address. The message was simple enough. The president repeated the promises of a decisive technological breakthrough he first made during his state-of-the-nation speech in March. But he was notably less belligerent this time. Nuclear weapons had given way to motherhood, youth and raising living standards. “Russia has been through troubles before,” he said. “And we always rise above them, like a Phoenix.” Later in the day, the president confirmed that, as expected, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would retain his role as head of the government. According to some sources, Mr Putin was also likely to appoint the liberal reformer Alexei Kudrin to a top economic post. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesNewly elected Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinian addresses the crowd in Republic Square in Yerevan.

These will mostly be paid for by increased taxes, given the limited appetite for serious reform.“No one is debating whether to reject crony capitalism, state control of business and the economy, or the confrontation with the West,” said Valery Solovey, professor of the Moscow State Institute for International Relations. “Of course, this is why there will be no real breakthrough”.According to a poll published on Monday by the independent Levada Centre, Russians say welfare and inequality remain the government’s biggest failure to date. The Kremlin fares better when it comes to foreign policy, with half mentioning the return of great power status as Mr Putin’s major achievement. The combination of both factors means political liberalisation is unlikely to be around the corner, Mr Solovey said.“It is too early to make strategic conclusions,” said Mr Solovey. “But if confrontation with the West and social tensions continue on their current trajectory, domestic policy is only going to get tougher.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It was their second time in Israel, and the visiting couple were served a top-notch meal by celebrity Israeli chef Segev Moshe.Japan\u0027s Abe makes controversial offering at \u0027shrine to militarism\u0027Netanyahu\u0027s performance shows why Iran nuclear deal needs to remainBut then came dessert.

There is nothing lowlier than a shoe in Japanese culture. Not only do they not wear shoes at home, you also won\u0027t find shoes in their offices.

What was the distinguished chef thinking? If it was humour, we don\u0027t think it is funny we were offended on behalf of our prime minister.Israel\u0027s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was not involved in approving the dishes for the meal.We respect and appreciate the chef. He is very creative, the ministry said.Trump and Shinzo Abe fail to agree on US tariff exemption for JapanMr Segev\u0027s creative side was displayed last May when President Trump visited Israel.

This is a high-quality piece of art made of cast metal in the shape of a shoe it is not a real shoe, Segev\u0027s publicist said in a statement, according to Yediot Aharonot.On Instagram, however, some of his 72,000 followers offered a different opinion:When you cook at a diplomatic meal, the minimum you can do is enquire about the guest. In Japan, shoes are considered contemptible, they always take off their shoes at the entrance to every home, both for themselves and for others, wrote one person.Another person wrote: you don\u0027t need to know any culture to know that serving shoes at a dinner is WRONG!World news in picturesWorld news in picturesNewly elected Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinian addresses the crowd in Republic Square in Yerevan.

The great charm is that the photos taken by the crowds over many decades capture all too rare moments when members of the Royal Family look genuinely relaxed and unguarded.The historian Dominic Sandbrook added: In many ways, this book could hardly be better timed. At a time when the monarchy is about to take a fresh step forward, with Prince Harry marrying a glamorous American actress, it represents a remarkably democratic glimpse of what, on the face of it, might seem a very old-fashioned institution. To some extent this is the story of a family who have proved extraordinarily successful in navigating between past and present, tradition and modernity, and to see that through the eyes of the Great British public for the first time, is quite special.Photobox spokesman Rory Scott said: \u0026ldquoAs soon as Karen Anvil\u0026rsquos world-famous picture of the \u0026ldquoFab Four splashed across every Boxing Day paper the idea of the book started was born. The ensuing journey has been nothing short of a photographic archaeological quest for long lost royal treasures lying forgotten in the nation\u0026rsquos attic archives. The public response has been overwhelming and I hope through the book and the myriad of candid, relaxed and informal photographs we so rarely see, we\u0026rsquore able to show another side to our Royal Family.The Crown from the Crowd was produced and published by Photobox to commemorate the royal wedding.

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling? Good?’”This heatwave Bank Holiday is the perfect chance to try this experiment, chaps.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They’re following the only possible logic of the Referendum result, the Prime Minister’s own speeches and the Tory manifesto – a document that those remoaning rebels seemed perfectly happy with when they were re-elected off the back of it last year.If a deal between the UK and Brussels stops Britain making independent trade agreements with the rest of the world, or leaves us subject to rules over which we have no say, then it would be a betrayal of the 17.4million people who wanted out of the EU.The Europhile backbenchers know that. If they win this battle, they’ll have succeeded in keeping us in Europe by the back door. They’ll mark it up as a victory, but this isn’t a political game.It would be an insult to democracy and hold our economy back.We must start work on building a truly Global Britain — now.THAT brickies and nurses are now having to scrimp and save for six-figure deposits is nothing short of a national scandal.No recent Government has been willing to grasp this particular nettle.Our housing crisis has been brewing for decades and sorting it will require real radicalism from the new Communities supremo James Brokenshire.He must fight the Nimbys head-on and demand Treasury cash to unleash a building programme.He must also tear up planning laws and look again at the Green Belt. The Tory leadership will be worried about their voters in the shires. But that’s nothing compared to the hit they’ll take for generations if they don’t face up to the challenge.MOTORISTS have been treated like cash cows for far too long.Plans for new “toxic taxes” rub salt in the wound, especially for diesel drivers.It wasn’t that long ago punters were told it was greener to buy diesels, so fining them years later in the name of environmentalism is especially unfair.It must be possible to “go green” without piling misery on hard-working Brits who rely on their motor to get to work, take the kids to school and visit the GP.Time for a u-turn on yet another fuel tax.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They used to pre-authorise your card for £1 but now it is £99.“So that is money taken from your account that you can’t use until they release it back once the other payment has cleared.“My complaint to them was that they should have notices on the petrol pumps making customers aware of this as they have changed their policy, 5th of may we got fuel and were still waiting for our refund. Absolute joke.”An Asda spokesman said the fee was issued by Visa and Mastercard and is part of a trial at several stores.A Mastercard spokesman: Last year a change in industry rules meant that petrol stations with automated fuel pumps were required to pre-authorise a value equivalent to a full tank of fuel, so that customers didn’t fill up with more fuel than they could afford.This is designed to protect them, and the petrol station.If customers don’t have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed.While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app - these funds are not taken from their account. Only the value of the petrol dispensed is withdrawn.A Visa spokesman said: “The way that pay-at-pump fuel payments are treated has been standardised across the industry to ensure security for individual cardholders, retailers and card issuers.“When an individual chooses to pay at a pay-at-pump fuel dispenser, an initial amount is held against their account while they dispense their fuel to ensure that they have sufficient funds to pay for the cost of their fuel. This initial amount should be adjusted immediately after fuel is dispensed to reflect the actual cost of the fuel.“Visa has been working closely with card issuing banks to ensure that consumers do not experience delays in the adjustment of the initially-held amount, however if consumers notice that initial amounts held against their accounts are not adjusted immediately, they should raise this with their card issuing bank in the first instance.”Other users expressed their anger at the charge.Charlotte Witcomb wrote: “What a joke.”Hope Sykes added: “It’s not like we have £99 for them to take in the first place.”Find the cheapest fuel prices.Use PetrolPrices. All you need to do is enter in your postcode and tell it how far you want to travel (up to 20 miles)Drive more efficiently. Some ways to do this, include:Prices at the pumps soared by almost 3p per litre last month, hitting millions of motorists.In February, we revealed how drivers face a postcode lottery with fuel costing £17 more if you live in the wrong town.The Sun Online recently revealed how soaring petrol and diesel prices mean Brits are paying an average of £60 more per year.Regardless of your vehicle, cutting down your fuel bill may be as simple as making a few adjustments to your vehicle and changing the way you drive. Here are a few tips from the AA.Its also worth keeping an eye out for offers, last weekend Topcashback was offering £15 off fuel for new customers - the discount was available at Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Co-op, Esso, BP, Texaco, Gulf, Jet, Murco and Shell petrol stations."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_3427-3-1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pensioner nurse who has lived in britain for 40 years out of pocket 4000 in windrush style immigration bungle","story":"Australian-born Heleena Yates, who turns 70 this week, said she felt suicidal at the height of her nightmare row with the Home Office over the right to remain in Britain.She told The Sun Online she had been dehumanised, persecuted, scapegoated and devalued by officials just like the Windrush generation, who have faced lengthy battles and threatened with deportation.After coming to the UK with her British husband in 1975 with all the proper documentation, she worked for decades as a nurse and midwife - and the pair had two children together.But in 2011 when she came to renew her passport, officials refused to replace her certificate of the right to abode, which let previously her stay in the UK for an unlimited time. Heleena wanted to keep her Australian passport so she didnt need a visa every time she went back to visit her elderly mother.The Home Office demanded she re-apply for her right to stay with reams of documents proving her years in Britain, and pay hundreds to do so.Rules were changed in 2006 which required additional information to apply for the right of abode.She had to track down her now ex-husband to get his birth certificate, passport, and proof of her National Insurance payments and every single address shed lived in since she arrived in the UK.After struggling with the situation and being made to feel like an illegal immigrant, she was then forced to hire lawyers which cost her thousands of pounds to work through all the documents.She claimed that officials said she was vulnerable to deportation at the border if she travelled to visit her family in Australia without the right paperwork.I felt suicidal, she revealed today, lashing out at the hostility of the Home Office.I thought, I dont want to live like this. I appreciate living in this country, but I dont feel valued.No one would listen to me.I was told if I didnt pay a certain amount to the Home Office that I could be deported.She claimed staff who she called to try and resolve the dilemma were rude to her and had picked on her case in order to meet the numbers required because she was an easy target.I was white, Im old, and they picked on me, she added.I was being deliberately targeted in order to reach their own targets set by the then-Home Secretary Theresa May without any intelligent thinking as to the consequences on entirely upstanding honest people like myself.Its an abuse of me as a human.After years of battling, Heleena finally secured her British citizenship in February 2017, and now has a British passport too.But she wants an apology from Theresa May and Sajid Javid - and compensation for the years of anxiety and uncertainty.Its all well to say for Theresa May to say that these people gave so much to this country... but you know what? So have I, Heleena said.Ive worked here for years, I had my children here.Why was I treated like this? Its absolutely disgusting.It seems they are only interested in ticking a box.Im not saying I should be treated specially, but I feel like Ive been completely victimised by a system that fails to understand the people.I have every sympathy for the Windrush generation.Last week Amber Rudd was forced to resign after getting swept up in the saga.She had claimed there was no such thing as deportation targets - but leaked letters proved they did and she knew about them.The desperate plight of Windrush generation immigrants has been highlighted in recent weeks after it emerged that thousands had been at risk of deportation for not having the correct documents.Despite coming to Britain in the 1950s and 1960s from Commonwealth countries and had been living here ever since, they had told to produce proof of their right to stay.One was denied NHS treatment for his cancer, and another missed his own mothers funeral because of the bungle.A Home Office spokesperson said today: UKVI staff are committed to providing people with appropriate and timely advice on how to progress their immigration case.Where we receive a complaint about the service provided, we will investigate thoroughly.

In lab tests, the drug started promoting growth in hair follicles in just two days – that’s pretty quick.“We are looking at using it as a topical treatment, a gel or shampoo that could reach the follicle.”Dr Hawkshaw said there are no known side-effects of the bone drug.The study, published in the journal Public Library of Science Biology, involved hair follicles donated by more than 40 men struggling with baldness.The tissue all started sprouting hair within days of being treated with the drug.Male-pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss, affecting around half of all men by 50 years of age.Currently only two drugs, minoxidil and finasteride, are available to treat the condition.But both have side-effects and do not always work.The only other option to balding blokes is hair transplantation.Scientists have also discovered a new drug that could cure baldness, especially in patients with alopecia.Researchers at Columbia University Medical Center found 75 per cent of patients with moderate to severe alopecia showed significant hair regrowth after taking the drug ruxolitinib.By the end of the treatment the average hair regrowth among patients was 92 per cent.Previous research has found that football players are more likely to go bald as repeated trauma to the hairline can cause chronic inflammation, which in turn can cause alopecia.Male pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss in men.It is a genetic condition that follows a pattern of a receding hairline and hair thinning on the crown of the head.It is caused by a hormonal and genetic predisposition.Each strand of hair you have sits in a tiny hole in the skin called a follicle.Generally, baldness occurs when the hair follicle shrinks over time, resulting in shorter and finer hair until, eventually, the follicle does not grow new hair.There are several options available to men who suffer from hair loss.Hair transplants: Removing tiny plugs of hair from areas where the hair is continuing to grow and placing them in areas that are balding. The procedure usually requires multiple sessions and may be expensive.Minoxidil: A solution that is applied directly to the scalp to stimulate the hair follicles. It slows hair loss for many men, and some men grow new hair but hair loss will return when you stop using it.Propecia: A drug that interferes with the production of a highly active form of testosterone that is linked to baldness. It slows hair loss. It works slightly better than minoxidil but hair loss will still return when you stop using this medicineOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

knife-edge votes later today, the PM said the Government was confident of defeating calls for a new Leveson-style inquiry and punishing sanctions regime.She told Cabinet Ministers that amendments tabled by Labour MPs to the Data Protection Act could undermine a free Press.Several Tory MPs have indicated they plan to back calls for a new statutory inquiry into the media.A second vote on proposals to impose court costs on publishers that refuse to join a state-recognised Press regulator — even if they win — is “too close to call”, sources said.Culture Secretary Matt Hancock is trying to win over MPs by promising to review journalists’ exemption from the Data Protection Bill in four years.Mrs May’s official spokesman insisted she believed the idea of imposing court costs on victorious publishers went against “natural justice”.And he said it would not be “proportionate” to restart the Leveson inquiry.Former Cabinet Minister Priti Patel last night urged MPs of all parties to put personal grudges aside and defend the free Press.MPs will today vote on a law that will pose a real threat to the freedom of our Press.The bill being debated is important, because it will give people more control over how their personal data is stored and used.However, new amendments put forward by certain MPs are an attempt to hijack the bill and to use it to force newspapers to sign up to a state-sponsored system of Press regulation, as well as to hold another long and costly inquiry into events of up to a decade ago.I chaired the Parliamentary Select Committee that helped to uncover the phone hacking scandal.The behaviour of those involved was shocking and it rightly led to criminal prosecutions of those responsible.It also resulted in the setting up of Lord Leveson’s inquiry, which sat for 15 months and cost more than £5million.Since that time, a lot has changed.A new body, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), has been set up to replace the old Press Complaints Commission.It is fully independent and has powers to investigate complaints and to impose penalties on publications that break the rules, including front page corrections and fines.Most recently, it is introducing a new system of compulsory arbitration which the UK’s 15 best-selling newspapers have agreed to join.This will give people low-cost access to justice without having to employ lawyers or go to court.This new system of Press regulation fulfils almost all of the requirements set down by Lord Leveson in his inquiry.In all important respects it meets the tests for recognition under the Government’s Royal Charter.However, for reasons of principle, not a single national publication, nor the vast majority of the local press, has been willing to join a government-approved regulator.It is hard to see why some now wish to persist with an inquiry into the past when so much has changed.Today, it is not the printed press that exerts influence and makes money but social media and the internet giants.Nor is it clear why they should want to impose massive penalties on newspapers that do not sign up to an alternative regulator that has been approved by the state.Under their proposals, newspapers that choose to remain outside the Government’s system of Press regulation will be liable to pay all the claimants’ costs of legal actions brought against them on data protection grounds as well as their own, whether they win or lose.At a time when many newspapers are struggling, a lot would not survive.Some of those pressing the amendments have their own grudges against the Press.The amendment by Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson to the Data Protection Bill is a jaw-droppingly blatant and probably illegal attempt to shut down newspapers he dislikes.It would compel every paper to submit to controversial State-backed ­regulator Impress, funded by his own millionaire benefactor Max Mosley. Every paper, that is, except the Labour-supporting .Incredibly, it is exempt.The free Press would reject such control — so new rules would force us to fund any legal claims against us even if we WON. Investigative journalism would be axed overnight as too risky. Hundreds of papers could be bankrupted and thousands of journalists dumped on the dole.The winners would be crooked politicians, tycoons and celebrities — placed in effect beyond scrutiny — and the Labour Party, having silenced its critics.Ed Miliband’s “Leveson 2” is just as bad: ANOTHER public inquiry, at vast cost, to rake yet again over the ashes of Press wrongdoing two decades ago.Even  opposes that.Maybe Miliband missed “Leveson 1” and all the (failed) trials of journalists.Maybe he hasn’t noticed that the Press is fighting for life in a totally new media landscape dominated by Facebook and Google, that it has changed its practices entirely and has a new regulator, IPSO, far more potent than any before it.The truth, though, is that neither Miliband nor Watson really care much about improving Press practices or securing justice for victims of intrusion. They seek revenge for The Sun abandoning Labour in 2009 and then exposing Miliband’s unsuitability to run Britain.They want a tame media “free” to churn out left-wing positions.If these amendments go ahead, the rest of the civilised world will regard Britain with horror.Dictators crush free speech . . . liberal democracies don’t.The Government, to its credit, opposes both proposals. Our free Press is not perfect, nor can it be.But Britain is better for its newspapers, and these toxic plans will damage our country immensely.They must be voted out.They have been unhappy about stories written about them in the past.I too bear the scars of having had tabloid press stories written about my private life.Some of these were inaccurate or purely salacious.That is the price of being in the public eye, although I also know the distress that such coverage can cause to others, particularly the families of those involved.However, the alternative of state controls on the Press is far more damaging and dangerous.The media play a vital role in a free society in exposing wrongdoing and holding governments to account.It is no accident that it is the world’s most authoritarian states which impose strict controls on their media.Britain is seen across the world as a bastion of liberty and human rights.It is essential that we reject these amendments and not put that reputation at risk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Others were involved. I didn’t have a clue.“You can’t kidnap your own child. I know the truth and I wasn’t involved in it. I still have nightmares thinking that it’s all going to happen again.Shannon was found at a flat belonging to Michael Donovan - the uncle of Karens then-boyfriend Craig Meehan, who had nothing do with the snatch.Matthews and Donovan devised the elaborate plot in a bid to claim the £50,000 reward money for finding Shannon.Donovan was also jailed as Matthews accomplice - but the mum maintains she had nothing to do with it.She protested: “I’m not Britain’s worst mum. I didn’t kill anybody.“Baby P’s mum and Maxine Carr don’t get the abuse that I do.“None of it’s true. I’m on the edge. It makes me want to kill myself but I’d never do that.I’m scared I’ll die lonely and alone.”The child snatcher was released from prison after serving just half of her eight year sentence and is now living under a new identity in the South of England.The born-again Christian now works in a Christian charity shop, where she says she doesnt feel judgedShe denied claims she was selling sandwiches to the ­homeless that had been handed out free by Pret A Manger shops.She said: “I never sold them I gave them to the homeless.“This woman that’s a church person was handing them out.“It was getting dark earlier and I used to go to help pick them up and take them to the homeless around the station. Sometimes I’d take them to the ­Salvation Army.She added: It makes me sick what was said, that’s not me.

His successor Kate Emms was signed off with PTSD after working for Mr Bercow for less than a year. The Speaker continues to deny any of the bullying allegations against him.And in a damning verdict on the Speaker, Parliament’s ex-‘Black Rod’ David Leakey said that the bullying claims made by former aides “risks bringing Parliament into disrepute”.He told the PoliticsHome website that Mr Bercow was “unworthy of someone in public office” and described the Speaker as “genuinely intimidating”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There were reports one person was transported to a hospital.Passenger Jim McManus told local media smoke began to seep through the cabin vents after the plane grounded in Denver and started taxiing to its arrival gate.He tweeted it was the flight from hell after the plane was reportedly delayed in Detroit for three hours before departing for Denver.Mr McManus added to Denver 7: “We were grateful that is wasn’t while we were in the air.“We were kind of sitting there complaining among ourselves...one guy pointed out that it didn’t happen while we were in the air….so once again, it couldn’t have gone any better.”The Denver Fire Department also said there was a report of smoke in the plane.Delta Airlines released a statement late Tuesday night: After arrival in Denver and during taxi to the gate, Delta flight 1854 from Detroit to Denver stopped on a taxiway where customers deplaned via slides and over-wing exits due to an observance of smoke in the cabin.“Airport response vehicles met the aircraft out of an abundance of caution and customers were transported to the terminal via buses.“The safety of Delta’s customers and crew is our top priority and we apologise for the concern this situation has caused.Denver International Airport tweeted: Earlier tonight, Delta flight 1854 from Detroit landed safely at DEN.As it was taxiing, smoke was reported in the cabin so the aircraft was safely evacuated.There were no flames.

When I do talks on obesity one of my top ten tips is pay at the pump, don’t go into the kiosk, and people really get that.”Industry claims that regulations on advertising are already tight are a “shocking sham”, MPs were told, as junk food adverts regularly appear on YouTube and Facebook.Dan Parker, an advertising executive turned obesity campaigner, said rules that prohibited online advertising for junk food on sites where more than a quarter of the audience were children were useless.“This code does not include Google, or any search engine,” he said.“It does not include YouTube, it doesn’t include Facebook, Twitter or any other social networks.“It is a shocking sham. If I type My Little Pony into Google, do I see junk food ads? Yes.”Stephen Woodford, chief executive of the Advertising Association, said: “My view, which is in line with a consensus of academics, is that advertising has a small impact on food preference.“It has even less impact on overall diet and even less on overweight and obesity.”Obesity levels in the UK have more than trebled in the last 30 years and, on current estimates, more than half the population could be obese by 2050, according to the NHS.About 27 per cent of the UK population is considered obese and a further 34 per cent are considered overweight, according to the latest Government statistics.Carrying excess weight, even if its just a little, has been linked to type 2 diabetes, stroke, heart disease and 11 different types of cancer.World Cancer Research Fund estimates 25,000 cases of cancer could be prevented every year in the UK alone if everyone was a healthy weight.According to the World Health Organisation heart disease was the biggest killer in 2015 followed by stroke, both of which were responsible for 15 million deaths worldwide."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000005064524.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labours emily thornberry suggests little miss books should be renamed because little implies women are worth less","story":"The Shadow Foreign secretary suggested the Little should be dropped from the female versions of the kids books because it implied that women were less.She told ITVs Good Morning Britain today: I dont like this thing about being little.

Lawmakers in Tehran have insulted the US president over his decision to pull out of the pact, saying he isn\u0027t mentally fit for office. Politicians also burned a symbolic copy of the Iran deal at the first session of parliament since Trump announced the US would pull out of the nuclear agreement. Trump called the Obama-era deal decaying and rotten and an embarrassment, leaving the UK, France and Germany and other nations scrambling to save it amid fears the president\u0027s move could lead to a new war in the Middle East.  Ali Larijani, the speaker of Iran\u0027s parliament, insulted the US president and called the move a political show that threatens his country\u0027s peace and security. He said: Trump does not have the mental capacity to deal with issues. He also said the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran should be ready to resume all nuclear activities.  General Mohammad Baqeri, the chief of staff of Iran\u0027s military, has said Iran did not have to sign the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).  He added: But that arrogant country (America) did not even stand by its signature. The head of Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guard, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, hit out at the West, saying Europeans are tied to the US and cannot make an independent decision. Observers have said America\u0027s withdrawal threats to spark political turmoil within Tehran\u0027s power structure.  President Hassan Rouhani, meanwhile, has said Iran would remain committed to the pact, aimed at stopping Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, despite Trump\u0027s announcement. But he warned that Iran was prepared to resume its nuclear activities. He said in a televised speech: If we achieve the deal\u0027s goals in cooperation with other members of the deal, it will remain in place. By exiting the deal, America has officially undermined its commitment to an international treaty.  I have ordered the foreign ministry to negotiate with the European countries, China and Russia in coming weeks. If at the end of this short period we conclude that we can fully benefit from the JCPOA with the cooperation of all countries, the deal would remain. But he warned: If needed, we will resume our nuclear enrichment at the industrial level without any limit. From now on, everything depends on Iran\u0027s national interests. Iran\u0027s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had said Iran would shred the agreement if the US withdrew. The pact was reached between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - Britain, China, France, Russia and the US - and Germany in 2015.

They can uphold 350 years of press freedom or stop newspapers from holding the rich, the powerful and the corrupt to account. In Britain we believe in decency and fairness. We want those who rig the system, whether it is MPs fiddling their expenses or slum landlords ripping off tenants, to be held responsible. And the main champion of the underdog in our open and democratic society is the Press. Yet the freedoms the Press enjoy – and with it the ability to expose wrongdoing – are under threat.  In the latest World Press Freedom Index, the UK was ranked 40th in the world behind countries such as Jamaica and Chile. And if two Labour MPs have their way today, those freedoms could be further eroded. Tom Watson and Ed Miliband have hijacked the Data Protection Bill by tabling amendments which could have serious consequences for investigative journalism, the viability of local papers and the openness of our democracy. What will the Tom Watson amendment do? The Shadow Culture Secretary is trying to resurrect a modified form of Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Court Act. This proposes that unless papers sign up to the state-recognised regulator IMPRESS, they will have to pay the legal costs of both sides in data protection cases, even if they win. The amendment exempts not-for-profit publishers such as the  and the Observer and titles in specific regions with a turnover below \u0026pound100million. But it would still cover 85% of local papers as most are owned by media companies, such as the Mirror’s publisher Reach, with turnovers above that amount. Watson is a friend of former Formula One boss Sir Max Mosley, who has harboured a deep loathing for newspapers since the News of the World revealed he took part in an S\u0026ampM party with prostitutes. He bankrolls IMPRESS through an arms-length charity and also gave Watson a \u0026pound500,000 donation to fund office costs and staff – money Watson has declined to give back despite the revelation Mosley published a campaign leaflet in the 1960s which linked non-white immigrants to diseases such as VD and leprosy.  Why should it be resisted? Local newspaper editors and freedom of speech campaigners say the amendment will cause irreparable damage to journalism. Editors will not be able to risk running stories exposing corruption or wrongdoing if they know it will result in expensive legal action. Jodie Ginsberg of Index on Censorship said it could be used by people to avoid exposure, even in cases such as the Windrush scandal where exposure is in the public interest. The main beneficiaries of Watson’s amendment would be those who want to wipe their grubby reputations clean by removing stories from the internet. This could include paedophiles with historical convictions or shady businessmen who want to start up their next dodgy venture. These are the sort of people who would threaten us with a data protection claim, knowing we would have to pay all the costs of the case unless we removed the articles about them from our websites, preventing you from seeing the truth. Mosley recently threatened the Mirror with a Data Protection Act claim concerning revelations about him that were heard in open court and are still available online. We are defending it vigorously. However, if the Watson amendment goes through, Mosley would get all the costs of his claim even if he lost, unless we were to join IMPRESS, the regulator HE helped found and finances through a trust. Media lawyer Antony White says the Watson amendment could also be illegal.  Who regulates the press? In the wake of the phone hacking scandal, the British press has changed the way it operates. Following the recommendation of Sir Brian Leveson’s inquiry, the majority of the country’s papers set up an independent regulator called IPSO. More than 2,600 print and online titles are now covered by IPSO which has the power to impose fines of up to \u0026pound1million and demand front page apologies for serious breaches. An independent review of IPSO by Sir Joseph Pilling found it to be independent, effective and compliant with most of Leveson’s recommendations. What is wrong with IMPRESS? No title of any significance has signed up to IMPRESS – and there are not just concerns about the motives of Mosley. It is governed by a Royal Charter, which in turn is overseen by politicians on the Privy Council. Any organisation that accepts it as its regulator also agrees, by extension, to state control. While the present regime may not interfere through the Privy Council, a future regime could use it to exert control over the press.

Even if you put aside Corbyn’s own ambivalence about the European project, the party is wrestling with how to placate a membership which is overwhelmingly pro-EU without alienating further leave voting supporters in Labour’s traditional heartlands.  Last week’s local elections were a stark reminder of the challenge facing Labour.   The party failed to make gains in places such as Nuneaton, Basildon, Walsall and Derby - all former or current Labour areas which voted to leave. At the same time it is benefiting from the anti-Brexit backlash among Tory voters in the metropolitan areas. The risk for Labour is its policy of ambiguity on Brexit has diminishing returns. Purist Remainers could turn to the Lib Dems or Greens, while Leave voters will feel betrayed if Labour fails to fulfil the result of the referendum. There are two votes in Parliament today which are too close to call.  One will see Labour try to force the government to reverse its decision to scrap student nurses’ grants .   The second will see MPs look to impose fresh regulations on the press .   Tom Watson has tabled an amendment to the Data Protection Bill which threatens the future of investigative journalism.  There is a good explainer by James Ball in the New Statesman here of the problems with Watson’s proposal .  If his amendment is carried then papers could be cowed from challenging those with the deepest pockets: the multinationals and the millionaires. Unless papers sign up to the state-recognise regulator they will, with a few exceptions, be forced to pay the legal costs of any action even if they subsequently win the case. For a national newspaper this is sufficiently chilling, for a local paper it is a form of censorship. There is no way a regional title already operating on limited resources would dare to challenge wrongdoing by a local bigwig or company if they face financial ruin. Bizarrely, Watson is exempting the  from this measure but not local papers such as the Liverpool Echo. This means the  and the Echo could publish the same story but only the former would be protected. There are many questions about the state of our media.  The lack of voices on the left, the influence of foreign-based press barons, the dominance of Facebook, the spread of fake news, the lack of accountability of the tech giants, the group think.  All of these are worthy subjects for discussion.  Refighting old wars seems a curious sense of priorities.

The group’s European arm is seeking buyers for “non-core” units which supply products to niche markets. The sale covers five business units, including Cogent, which manufactures electrical steels based in Newport, South Wales Firsteel, which coats steel for kitchen bakeware based in Walsall, West Mids and Wolverhampton-based Engineering Steels Service Centre, which processes engineering steels. Other sites are in Canada, Sweden, Germany and Turkey. The units covered by the announcement employ a total of 1,100 workers, who face weeks of uncertainty.  It comes as Tata continues talks about a possible merger with German firm ThyssenKrupp.  Senior Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, whose South Wales constituency includes Britain’s biggest steelworks, Port Talbot, said: “Tata has unequivocally assured the steel unions that it would not engage in the sale of any assets during the process of joint venture negotiations with ThyssenKrupp. “It is therefore surprising and disappointing to see that Tata appears to be reneging on that commitment.” Community steelworkers’ union boss Roy Rickhuss said: “Clearly this will bring yet another period of uncertainty to hundreds of steelworkers across the UK and will be worrying news for many of them and their families.  “We are yet to be persuaded of the business cases for these proposed sales and we are calling on Tata to demonstrate that it is a responsible seller in practical terms by allowing time for the unions and our experts to look at the rationale behind today’s announcement.  “No sale agreements should be signed before full consultation has taken place. “During our discussions with Tata about the merger with ThyssenKrupp, we secured a commitment that there would be no asset closures and this principle must be upheld throughout this process and any sale.” Shadow Steel Minister Gill Furniss urged Tata to “work closely with the unions to seek the most sustainable and responsible way forward”. She added: “During conversations about its merger with ThyssenKrupp, Tata made their commitments clear that there would be no asset stripping. “They must honour these firm commitments throughout any sale process.” Tata Steel’s European operations chief executive Hans Fischer defended the planned sell-off.  He said: “These potential sales follow the successful sale of other non-core businesses in recent years, such as Long Products Europe and Speciality Steels. “Under new ownership these former Tata Steel businesses have found the focus to secure a more sustainable future.  “In turn, these divestments have allowed us to focus resources on making significant improvements to the core strip business, as part of our ambition to develop the most sustainable steel business in Europe focused on our IJmuiden and Port Talbot value chains.

Laura Jackson, 32, says becoming a single parent had a dramatic financial impact leaving her living on \u0026pound2,000 less every month. Instead of spending money on healthy meals for herself, she made sure her children ate good food and she would sit alone in the house and snack on pizza and chips, chocolate and 50p biscuit packs.  Cooking a healthy meal for one is expensive and I wanted to save my money to make sure the children had enough, she told Mirror. I always fed them good quality food but biscuits, chips and pizza are so much cheaper than a chicken breast so that\u0027s what I would eat. And I\u0027ve always loved chocolate!  Laura would also make \u0027bad choices\u0027, eating too many takeaways and meals out in restaurants. I was going out loads and enjoying life too much, Laura said. I was a single mum and I gorged if I had a good day and I gorged if I had a bad day. I ate to console myself when things went wrong and to reward myself as a treat.  However, it wasn\u0027t long before Laura, then 28, piled on more than 6st and went from a size 14 to a size 22. One day while out shopping with friends she realised that she had gained so much weight that shops did not stock clothes big enough to fit her.  Determined to lose weight she started a meal replacement programme and a high protein diet but she still craved cake and found that many supermarkets did not stock any healthy alternatives to her liking. So Laura went home and started experimenting in the kitchen, baking healthy, protein-based snacks for her and her family and in doing so, she stumbled on a major gap in the market. Since starting The Protein Bakery in August last year, Laura has piled on the pounds again by building a multi-million pound business in just eight months creating \u0027healthy\u0027 guilt-free cakes. Her business has a projected turnover of almost \u0026pound3m for the first year and she has secured deals with two national supermarket chains. She counts Strictly Come Dancing and Emmerdale star Gemma Atkinson, a host of sporting professionals and The Real Housewives Of Cheshire among The Protein Bakery\u0027s celebrity fans.  Laura believes her determination was key to making it a success. People said \u0027you can\u0027t do it, you have no experience, you won\u0027t get retailers to listen to you.\u0027 But I was determined. I wanted a better life for my kids and I believed there was a gap in the market, she said. Her children, William, 10, Gabriella, 9, Elodie, 5, and Mila, 2, were her chief product testers and once they loved her cakes and could not tell that they were \u0027healthy\u0027, she knew she was onto a winner. I invested my own money in it. I Googled about business and recipes all night. I went into sales meetings and had to look up what business terminology meant on my phone to learn that language. I sent samples to celebrities like Gemma Atkinson, Christine McGuiness and Duncan from Blue with a handwritten note asking them to mention the product on their social media accounts if they liked them. Usually you have to pay for endorsement but I could not afford that. They were so kind and it really worked. After Gemma Atkinson shared my product on Instagram I got 700 new followers almost instantly. I think my story also inspires a lot of people. I was a single mum, struggling with my weight who became a business entrepreneur creating healthy snacks. I was scared at first to put myself out there but I realised that if you want people to buy your product they need to know who you are. Sharing my personal story really helped me build the business.  Her experience as a cash-strapped single mum also inspired her to keep the cost down. Her protein snacks will sell as three bars for \u0026pound2 as opposed to \u0026pound2.49 for one. I used to feel guilty as a single mum that I could not afford to buy healthier snacks for my kids. I want everyone to be able to afford these. I select my ingredients carefully and really think about how to produce them cost-effectively. I\u0027m also careful not to be greedy. I would rather work on lower profit margins so the products can be accessible to everyone. As a former dieter, she was inspired to create a high-protein product sold on the baked goods aisle instead of being hidden away on the healthy foods shelf - a first Laura claims for that product category. I want my products to be accessible to everyone so that someone like me can walk by and buy a guilt-free treat. A high-protein diet is beneficial to many people, not just body-builders or gym fanatics. They\u0027re made with healthy, everyday ingredients and you can make them at home so they belong on that aisle. Before her baking revolution she had a beautician business in her home town of Congleton, Cheshire, which employed three people but did not have enough to pay for extras like holidays. And in just eight months, what she hoped would be a \u0027pocket-money\u0027 business with an aim of turning over \u0026pound600 a month to save for a a family holiday, quickly became a booming business with a multi-million pound projected turnover.  She just signed a major deal with Asda which will stock her products in 350 stores nationwide from May 17 and in September she will launch with other major retailers. Laura said: I burst into tears when I was told about the deal. I had to really cut back on the kids to pay for packaging and ingredients for the business so to have that financial pressure lifted was incredible. It was like light suddenly dawning at the end of the tunnel. Suddenly I knew I could pay for simple things like my kids\u0027 school trips next month. Laura has an exclusive deal with a bakery to produce her recipes under her guidance and she will employ administrative staff this summer. I need to manage the business but keep time for my kids, I started it for them so if it takes my time away from them the whole thing loses its point, she added. A cookbook is also in the pipeline, followed by baking sets designed to make healthy baking affordable and easy and a cookware and utensils range. While she was on her weight loss journey, which began with meal replacement and a high-protein diet, she met her now husband Dylan in a bar in their local town. The couple welcomed their first child, Mila, into the world in January 2016 and married last year. Laura explained: I was a size 18 at the time and a single mum but he loved me for who I was. He helped me through the dark days when I just wanted to give up. He\u0027s been hugely supportive. Fake it \u0027till you make it: Have confidence in yourself. You can learn something really quickly if you put the effort in and it may surprise you just how much you can achieve. Networking is key: I had no contacts before I started using LinkedIn. Use networking events. By the end of the event you will have helped other people and found solutions for issues of your own. Use social media: LinkedIn was a vital tool for me to make contact with suppliers and retailers. Instagram was a great tool to promote my brand and the business. Goals: Identify what motivates you, focus on what you want to achieve and make small, achievable goals. Keep a clear budget: Costs can quickly spiral and cash-flow issues can arise quickly when you have to pay suppliers before payment comes from sales. Be realistic and very strict with your budget. Use Google and teach yourself: I used to spend all night researching the business online. Initially I did not understand what people said in meetings. Now I walk in and I understand it all. Have a story: Build your personal story and motivation into the identity of your business. A genuine personal story and sharing yourself with your audience helps them relate more to your product."},{"url":null,"title":"couple who weigh 55 stone","story":"NewsCouple who weigh 55 stone \u0027banned\u0027 from taxis after car suspension broke\u0027Marcus Edwards and Taylor Faulkner, from Hodge Hill in Birmingham, used to use Centrex Cars up to four times a day\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter11:38, 9 MAY 2018Updated11:42, 9 MAY 2018NewsMarcus Edwards weighs 36 stone and claims he has been banned from using Centrex Cars\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A couple who weight a combined 55 stone claim they have been banned from taxis because the 36-stone boyfriend broke the suspension of two different cabs.

Retired priest Philip Clements, 79, wed Florin Marin, then 24, at a low key ceremony in Ramsgate, Kent in April last year.  He said he was making a stance against Church of England rules barring clergymen from same-sex marriage .   But the pair split after just five months, which left Mr Clements penniless after he sold his \u0026pound214,000 home to buy his younger lover a flat in his native Romania, reports KentLive .  But despite a rocky start to married life, the pair have decided to embark on a make or break relationship - with Mr Clements declaring he will write his younger lover into his will if things go to plan. The 79-year-old explained: “I have got to be realistic. I am 80 in August and I want to see him secure.  “He is the only one I can leave things to. I don’t see much of my brothers, and they wouldn’t need it. “If it goes well, he will be in my will. After moving to Bucharest to settle down with his new husband, Mr Clements found himself miserable and lonely when his younger partner would go out clubbing with his friends. The 79-year-old then returned to England without a roof over his head after selling his home, and was forced to live in the annex of a friend\u0027s house. Shortly after they split, the heartbroken ex-priest then discovered Mr Marin to be dating a new boyfriend called Jesus after he appeared on a Romanian TV show. Speaking of Mr Marin\u0027s relationship, the ex-priest said: “Romanian TV has a habit of making things into mini soap operas where they make some sort of story around ordinary people.  “Due to the fact I had left him, they (the TV producers) arranged for him to meet this man. “The story was invented. He is not with him now, even if he was with him. “I’m pretty sure he wasn’t with him, and it was a made up thing.” Despite going their separate ways, the pair never divorced and Mr Clements has since admitted they remained in contact almost everyday. After celebrating their first wedding anniversary in Elche, Spain - where Mr Marin now lives - the pair have since made plans to test the relationship again.  Mr Clements said: We have learned. We have both had to adjust. There were rumours he was with somebody else, but he has denied that. We are planning to spend September and Christmas together, and hopefully it can go from there. But we don\u0027t want to jump too far just yet. He is young, and has plans ahead of him. But I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to die just yet, there is a few years left in the old boy.

But the same amount of white wine could increase the risk of developing the disease, researchers have warned.  The study, published in the journal Clinical Epidemiology, said the discrepancy could be down to natural chemicals in the skin of red grapes which are released during the wine-making process. Levels of the natural chemical resveratrol are said to be 10 times higher in red wine than in white wine. Scientists say drinking a ‘moderate amount’ of red could lead to a 12% less chance of developing prostate cancer. The same couldn’t be said for white wine, which led to a ‘slight’ increase in risk. Scientists, from institutions in Romania, Austria, Japan, Italy, Switzerland, Jordan, Canada, and the USA, looked at 611,169 men included in 17 studies over the years in the meta analysis.  They said: “Moderate wine consumption did not impact the risk of prostate cancer. “Interestingly, regarding the type of wine, moderate consumption of white wine increased the risk of prostate cancer whereas moderate consumption of red wine had a protective effect. “Further analyses are needed to assess the differential molecular effect of white and red wine conferring their impact on prostate cancer risk.” Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in UK men, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Each year around 11,000 men in the UK will die from the disease. Studies in the past have indicated how drinking beer could lead to an increased risk.  Scientists continued: “In the present study, we found that wine is not associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer as other alcohol or beer consumption is. “This could be based on several factors that make wine less harmful than other types of alcohols. “One of the factors might be the chemical composition of wine, which is a hydroalcoholic solution with a wide range of bioactive chemical components, including aldehydes, esters, ketones, lipids, minerals, organic acids, phenolics, soluble proteins, sugars and vitamins. “Second, the anti carcinogenic effect of polyphenols mainly contained by red wine may balance any other harmful effects of wine consumption. “Third, in the case of beer, the bioavailability of the phenolic compounds is very low, thus decreasing their potential anti carcinogenic effects.”  Men over the age of 50, those with a family history of the disease, and blank men are more at risk of prostate cancer. Dr Jiri Kubes, a specialist in prostate cancer and medical director at Proton Therapy UK, said: “A number of studies have looked at the relationship between alcohol and cancer, indicating that drinking more alcohol puts you at more risk. “But little has been focused on investigating red wine and its associations with prostate cancer, particularly drinking at a moderate level. “Clearly, the advice isn’t to start drinking more alcohol, but to encourage responsible drinking.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i know am right punters","story":"News\"I know I am right\": Punter\u0027s fury after bookmakers refuse £100 bet that Earth is flat in bid to win millionsFlat Earth truther Gerrard Gallacher insists it\u0027s a bet he would win - and it would cost bookies millions of pounds\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByConnor Lynch09:59, 9 MAY 2018Updated10:28, 9 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A punter has been left furious after bookmakers refused to accept his \u0026pound100 bet that Earth is flat.  Flat Earth truther Gerrard Gallacher has been rejected by a number of the main national bookies because his request is invalid. The Grimsby man firmly believes it\u0027s a bet he would win - and says it would cost bookies millions of pounds.  Gerrard, who doesn\u0027t believe manned rockets have been sent into space, told the Grimsby  that the bookmakers know I am right and they should at least accept his wager.   He first began thinking that the Earth was flat a few years ago after becoming curious about the subject. Since then he has done his own research and is now even more convinced that Earth isn\u0027t round. Gerrard, who has tried to bet up to \u0026pound100, said: I think the reason that they won\u0027t accept my bet is because they know that I am right in saying that the Earth is flat, and if other people joined me in placing the bet they could lose millions. But then even if I am proven wrong and the world is round, then why would they not take my bet? It is just easy money for them.  William Hill are known for taking on crazy bets, I could go in now and bet my son will play for Celtic and score a hat-trick in 20 years, and they have even accepted one saying Elvis will come back from the dead, so why not that the Earth flat? I have tried everyone - Paddy Power, Bet 365, William Hill and Coral - but none of them are interested. I thought I had made some progress with SkyBet as they were open about it when I spoke with them, but yet again they came back to me and said they wouldn\u0027t do it. One of the main reasons he believes Earth is flat is the conspiracy theory that there are no real photos of the planet from space, and the existing images were generated by a Nasa computer.  Gerrard said: I just don\u0027t believe that we have ever sent rockets into space. I cannot comprehend that if space is a vacuum where there is no air, then what do the rockets propel against? I have also viewed footage of amateur weather balloons that clearly show to me that the Earth is flat, as I cannot see a curvature anywhere. Another reason that has convinced me is that apparently water is always meant to fall at a level and does not bend. So then how does the Earth manage to bend water all the way around a globe, it just doesn\u0027t seem to add up.

In her first full interview, for which she was not paid, she told the Mirror that she is not evil and insists she knew nothing of the snatch plot that shocked the nation. Shannon was found sedated at the home of Michael Donovan, uncle of Matthews’ boyfriend Craig Meehan, after a search lasting 24 days. Matthews and Donovan were found guilty at Leeds Crown Court of \u0026shykidnapping, false imprisonment, and perverting justice. Both were given eight-year prison sentences. Last year, the BBC screened a drama, The Moorside about Shannon’s kidnap. Gemma Whelan starred as Karen Matthews, Sheridan Smith played her best pal Julie Bushby and Sian Brooke was neighbour Natalie Brown. Here is what has happened to the people involved in the real life drama on the Moorside estate in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire in 2008.  Shannon was taken into care after the trial, and now lives with a new family. She is 19 years old now and was given a new identity which cannot be revealed. Karen Matthews Shannon\u0027s mum Karen was released from jail in 2012 after serving half of her eight-year sentence. The 43-year-old, who has a new identity, was relocated away from her home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. She has dramatically changed her appearance as the Mirror\u0027s exclusive pictures show.  Julie Bushby Played by Sheridan Smith in the series, Julie led the search for Shannon after her \u0027disappearance\u0027. She still lives in Dewsbury and has admitted she feels sorry for Karen Matthews after the ordeal. She visited her friend in prison monthly for four years in an attempt to discover the truth about what happened - but stopped when she didn\u0027t get answers.  “I just wanted the truth,” said Julie. “She kept saying other people were involved, I wanted the truth, to know who, why, what.” After Karen was released from prison, her contact with Julie stopped as the terms of her release meant she was unable to communicate with her.  Natalie Murray was another of Karen\u0027s friends who helped her in the search for Shannon. She is now a stay-at-home mum and left Dewsbury in 2009. Appearing on TV ahead of the drama\u0027s airing, she revealed she will never be able to forgive Karen. “It started when she did the very first interview outside her house,” recalled Natalie.  “I was there when the family liaison officer told her not to do the interview or speak to the press until they had as much information as they could get, and then they’d deal with that side of the press. It was due to previous cases when a child has gone missing and it could put their life at risk. But Karen did the interview. To me, as a mum, why would you do that when you’ve been told it could put a child’s life at risk?” Natalie said she “went straight down and asked her” why she did it, and claimed Karen’s answer was “everybody told me” to do it. “[I felt] angry that nobody listened to me or saw what I was seeing about her behaviour or things like that,” added Natalie.  Craig Meehan was Karen\u0027s boyfriend at the time - and his uncle Michael Donovan was found to have planned Shannon\u0027s disappearance to generate money from the publicity and search. Although he wasn\u0027t involved in the kidnapping, he was convicted of possession of child pornography after police examined computers at the home.  He was sentenced to 20 weeks imprisonment, but was released on the same day as he had spent longer on remand than the length of the sentence.

The 43-year-old child kidnapper - dubbed Britain’s Worst Mother for arranging the disappearance of her nine-year-old daughter Shannon - claims there\u0027s no sex involved in her relationship with \u0027father figure\u0027 Eric Anderson.  MirrorOnline reported on Saturday how Eric, a self-proclaimed devout Christian, was said to have funded a lavish lifestyle for Matthews - having helped her kit out her state-funded flat with top-of-the-range appliances and super-fast internet.   In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mirror today , Matthews - who has a new identity - denied claims he was her \u0027sugar daddy\u0027.  But she admitted that she is friends with the smitten pensioner - and that as well as giving her money to \u0027help her out\u0027, he takes her for coffee and KFC. She said: “I have standards. I’m very lonely and I found a friend who I thought I could trust. A true friend. “He was just somebody to talk to because I’ve got nobody else. Somebody has blown our relationship out of context. He did give me money because he wanted to help me.  “He got the money from some inheritance and said he wanted to help me out because I’m struggling. “He’s like a father figure to me, like an uncle. There’s no sex involved. I’ve known him for years. Eric takes me for coffee and KFC and tells me not to go with the nasty men I have met and not to be taken advantage of. I’ve sworn off men. I will never get married. I don’t trust them at all. “I’m trying to get my life back on track and everything that is being said is not true.” Matthews, who was relocated away from her home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, claimed she did however have admirers on the outside while she was in prison. She said: “Men used to write to me with semi-naked pictures and ask if I fancied meeting up because everyone makes mistakes.” Matthews was found guilty at Leeds Crown Court of \u0026shykidnapping, false imprisonment, and perverting justice. She was given an eight-year prison sentence. Despite being found guilty of snatching Shannon when the youngster was nine and serving four years of an eight year sentence, Matthews still refuses to accept she took any part in the plot to cash in on \u0026pound50,000 reward money.  Sources close to Matthews – who has dramatically changed her appearance – have previously claimed she has targeted older males since \u0026shyleaving prison in 2012. She is said to have posted profiles on websites for women seeking financial arrangements with men. One source said: “She has an \u0026shyimpressive lifestyle for someone who has been in prison for arranging the kidnap of her own child. “She puts on a good show about having changed but the truth is different. You would think she would be destitute given her past but she has somehow found a way to live a very nice life. “She had friends over for a party and there was apparently champagne and canapes – it certainly wasn’t on a budget. “She has a huge flat screen TV and a Samsung Galaxy 8 smartphone that she flashes about.”  Matthews, who claims to have found God while in prison, now works in a charity shop alongside generous \u0026shypensioner Eric. A source added: “She’s not getting that money from volunteering. “She makes no secret of the fact that she has older benefactors who keep her in the lifestyle she wants. “She knows how to manipulate \u0026shypeople to get what she wants.” Eric last week declined to comment on whether the relationship is sexual or if born-again Christian Matthews is paid for companionship. But he admitted giving her “care and support” and teaching her about “love.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kidnapper mum karen matthews shannon","story":"News\u0027I\u0027m not Britain\u0027s worst mum - I didn\u0027t kill anyone\u0027 - Karen Matthews insists she\u0027s not evil despite snatching daughter ShannonEXCLUSIVE - In first interview since kidnapping scandal, 43-year-old protests her innocence and tells of fear that she will die lonely and alone\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLucy Thornton07:30, 9 MAY 2018Updated08:24, 9 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTen years after being jailed for \u0026shykidnapping daughter Shannon , Karen \u0026shyMatthews still finds it hard to shake off the tag of most despised mum. But the 43-year-old has spoken out in a bid to convince the nation she is not evil and insist she knew nothing of the snatch plot that shocked the nation. Matthews even offered to take a lie detector test about what happened to her daughter when she vanished in February 2008 before being found at an accomplice’s flat tethered to a bed. And without any hint of remorse over the sick kidnap, she pointed to other vile criminals to justify her claim that she should not be branded evil.  Mum-of-seven Matthews said: “I’m not Britain’s worst mum. I didn’t kill anybody. “Baby P’s mum and Maxine Carr don’t get the abuse that I do. “None of it’s true. I’m on the edge. It makes me want to kill myself but I’d never do that. I’m scared I’ll die lonely and alone.” Despite being found guilty of snatching Shannon when the youngster was nine and serving four years of an eight year sentence, Matthews still refuses to accept she took any part in the plot to cash in on \u0026pound50,000 reward money. She said she was made a “scapegoat” and added: “From the start I didn’t know where she was. Others were involved. I didn’t have a clue. “You can’t kidnap your own child. I know the truth and I wasn’t involved in it. I still have nightmares thinking that it’s all going to happen again.  “I want to take a lie detector test to prove my innocence.” But she says she fears she won’t be forgiven.  Shannon was kidnapped from near her home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorks. Her disappearance sparked a massive month-long police search. Matthews and her then boyfriend Craig Meehan joined the hunt and she made several public appeals for help to find her daughter. Shannon was found on March 14 at Michael Donovan’s flat in nearby Batley Carr. She had been drugged. Donovan was also found guilty of kidnap, sentenced to eight years and released after four. But he was recalled to prison in 2012 after a bust-up in Leeds. Born-again \u0026shyChristian Matthews spoke about her time behind bars. She said: “When I was first in jail I thought I was going to die. I panicked.  “They were banging on my cell door saying, ‘Come out here, you dirty nonce.’ Prison made me weaker. I don’t feel like the same person any more. I was beaten up inside because of who I was. “Once they threw a snowball with a rock in it at me and other times I was punched. I didn’t say anything, I was too scared.” But Matthews insisted she did make friends, including a transgender prisoner in Peterborough’s segregation unit. And she claimed she had admirers on the outside. She said: “Men used to write to me with semi-naked pictures and ask if I fancied meeting up because everyone makes mistakes.” Matthews also used our interview to deny claims she has a 72-year-old “sugar daddy”, Eric Anderson.  She said: “I have standards. I’m very lonely and I found a friend who I thought I could trust. A true friend. “He was just somebody to talk to because I’ve got nobody else. Somebody has blown our relationship out of context. He did give me money because he wanted to help me. “He got the money from some inheritance and said he wanted to help me out because I’m struggling. “He’s like a father figure to me, like an uncle. There’s no sex involved. I’ve known him for years. Eric takes me for coffee and KFC and tells me not to go with the nasty men I have met and not to be taken advantage of. I’ve sworn off men. I will never get married. I don’t trust them at all. “I’m trying to get my life back on track and everything that is being said is not true.”  Matthews also denied claims she was selling sandwiches to the \u0026shyhomeless that had been handed out free by Pret a Manger shops. She said: “I never sold them I gave them to the homeless. “This woman that’s a church person was handing them out. “It was getting dark earlier and I used to go to help pick them up and take them to the homeless around the station. Sometimes I’d take them to the \u0026shySalvation Army. It makes me sick what was said, that’s not me. I was doing it out of the goodness of my heart.”  Matthews was relocated to a town in the south of England for her own safety after being released from prison. She said she spends her days walking from charity shop to charity shop, trawling for bargains. But she also works as a volunteer in a \u0026shyChristian charity shop. She added: “I am really proud of getting a job. It makes me feel like I’ve achieved \u0026shysomething for myself. “I feel I’m not being judged when I’m there. I love my job and I love going in every time. They say I’m a good worker, one of their best and I could get a paid job in the future.”  But Matthews revealed she has now stopped going to church. She said: “People found out who I was and I was getting grief there, people saying, ‘Oh, do you know who that is?’ “I felt uncomfortable and there were kids there as well. I still believe in God, I just don’t go to church now.” Matthews lives in a one-bedroom basement flat with her budgie Bob. She said she is still “terribly lonely” and added: “I talk to Bob when I get home. I feed him from my hand. “I don’t want a man. I don’t trust them. It’s just me and the budgie now.” Because of her time behind bars Matthews said she is uncomfortable indoors. She added: “I hate being trapped. I have to get out.”  When she goes out she puts a head band on to cover up her roots as her natural ginger hair starts to appear. She isn’t very well – doctors said she has gallstones – and she is on pills to ease the pain as she awaits surgery. Matthews said: “It scared me. I’ve lost six stone since because it was down to fatty foods. I used to eat lots of sweets but now I try to eat better.” Last year the BBC screened a drama, The Moorside, about \u0026shyShannon’s kidnap. Gemma Whelan starred as Matthews, Sheridan Smith played her best pal Julie Bushby and Sian Brooke was neighbour Natalie Brown. In the past, Matthews has spoken to the Mirror about how the only thing she missed in jail was sex and \u0026shyshopping. In another interview she claimed she knew where Shannon was after she had been snatched – contradicting her own story. Karen Matthews has not been paid for this interview.

Leanne Bale and her teenage daughter Taylor formed a search party when Joe Cannon didn\u0027t return from a ride out on his new 125cc motorbike - bought so he could start another job. But they came across the scene of a tragic accident. Paramedics spent an hour battling to save the young dad after a heroic witness had tried to perform CPR. Leanna and Joe been inseparable since their first meeting in 2013 and became engaged on Christmas Day when the 30-year-old proposed in their living room. The tragedy unfolded in the village of Drybrook in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, just after midnight on Sunday.  Leanne has paid tribute to the “love of her life” who can never be replaced. “I loved him so, so much, my world will never be the same again,” she told Gloucestershire Live . As well as Leanne, Joe leaves behind their son Jai Jai, who will be two in July. His grieving fiancee said: “I’m not the only one, everybody loved Joe. He was an amazing dad and all the kids loved him because he was a big kid himself. “Everybody warmed to him because he was always helping people out and he made friends wherever he went. “He wasn’t one of those men who are too scared to show his feelings. When Joe loved you, you knew it. He was really soppy. “He loved us and he loved his family to bits. I still can’t believe he’s gone.” Joe had bought the motorbike online on Saturday because the general handyman and labourer was due to start a new job making glamping pods after the bank holiday weekend.  He was excited about the bike but was having problems starting it so took it for a late night test run around the village on Saturday night. When he didn’t come home, Leanne and teenage daughter Taylor went for a walk to see if he had broken down and came across the scene of the accident. As paramedics battled to save him for about an hour, a devastated local woman who had given Joe mouth to mouth until the 999 crews arrived spoke to Leanne, but she could not take in what was being said. “Never in your wildest dreams do you think something so awful could happen,” she said. “I could see the blue flashing lights and I was thinking broken bones and working out what to do because I thought I’d be sitting in A\u0026ampE for hours. “People were talking to me but nothing was going in. I just went numb and went back to wait. Then somebody from the police knocked on the door to say he had gone. Even now I can’t believe it.  “I like to think he was smiling. He hadn’t had a bike for years and was so excited to get one he could not stop smiling all day. “I didn’t want him to go out that night but he was so excited, he wanted to ride it.” Joe was born and brought up in a close-knit loving Mormon family to a school secretary mother. He also leaves a stepfather Jeff and siblings Beth, Nathan, Zac and Matt, who is currently working in New Zealand. The keen sportsman played rugby for the school and Gloucester All Blues RFC. “His mum says he was a cheeky little tyke at school and he grew up to be a cheeky, cheeky man, but he was our cheeky man,” she said. The couple met when Leanne saw an image on social media and commented that his son Tyler, who lives with his “lovely” mother in and stays with the couple weekends, and her daughter Taylor had the same blanket. After a week talking non-stop, nonsense to each other for hours at a time Leanne caught a bus to Gloucester to meet him. It was love at first sight for both of them and they have been together ever since.

A tribunal review today called a Restricted Parking Zone (RPZ) in Coventry city centre unenforceable and added that its signs were confusing and the public had been \u0027misled\u0027 The Traffic Penalty Tribunal ruling upheld six cases but the decision could land the authority with a heavy bill if it impacts the tens of thousands of drivers fined since the zone was set up. Between October 2012 and August 2017 58,536 fines were dished out - equal to about 30 tickets a day.  If all of those drivers fined decide to appeal to the Traffic Penalty Tribunal, and have their appeal upheld the council could be looking at forking out millions of pounds to make things right. If all of the drivers had paid the higher rate of \u0026pound70, the council\u0027s bill could be upwards of four million (\u0026pound4,097,520). Coventry City Council strongly opposes the decision and said it is taking legal advice on a possible challenge. Chief Adjudicator Caroline Sheppard OBE said the information about parking could be easily missed as some of the gateway signs had been placed in unusual locations and also close to signs warning about a change of speed limit. She also said there hardly any repeater signs present during her visit to the city and none in some of the streets where fines had been complained about. She said it would be particularly confusing for visitors coming to the university and those attending tourist attractions in the city centre, she added. She concluded: Coventry City Council’s enthusiasm for the concept of a city centre zone bounded by Ringway that they are blind to the fact that motorists unfamiliar with Coventry are confused and effectively misled into thinking that the street where they parked is unrestricted.

Chantelle Parry, 31, fell ill with glandular fever two years ago.  This set in motion a downward spiral that eventually led her to be diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as ME or chronic fatigue syndrome.  The super-fit party animal loved to dance as much as she loved going out at weekends. Now the mum to eight-year-old Alice can only dream about dancing.  I was an adrenaline junkie who had done three skydives - now I can\u0027t work, spend weeks in bed and am unable to do anything,” she told Birmingham Live .   I have to rely on others to look after my daughter, cook for me, clean my house and even washing my hair. I feel like I have lost my independence and have nowhere to turn to. Chantelle later found out she had ME. She says even bright lights can put her back in bed and one of the most upsetting things about ME is being forced to justify her disability. She said: I almost feel like I spend my life trying to explain my illness to people. I always get the response \u0027oh that\u0027s where you are tired, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 But it\u0027s so much more than tiredness - it\u0027s fatigue with the worst pain imaginable - and I\u0027ve had a baby. The most important recognisable symptoms are are: exhaustion not relieved by rest, exercise-induced muscle fatigue, post-exertional malaise/symptom exacerbation, problems with short term memory, concentration, attention span, unrefreshing sleep, problems with pulse and blood pressure control leading to feeling faint and orthostatic intolerance.  On going flu-like symptoms including sore throats and enlarged glands can also occure.  Other common symptoms include: pain - which can involve muscle, joints and nerves, alcohol intolerance, problems with balance and temperature control, sensitivity to light and sound.  It\u0027s not known what causes ME, but there are a number of theories - for example, it may be triggered by an infection, or certain factors could make you more likely to develop the illness. Suggested causes or triggers for ME include viral infections, such as glandular fever bacterial infections, such as pneumonia problems with the immune system a hormone imbalance your genes - ME seems to be more common in some families.  ME is a fluctuating condition - meaning that the symptoms vary throughout the day and from day to day and week to week. ME is diagnosed on the typical clinical history and excluding other causes of an ME/CFS like illness. There are no blood or other diagnostic tests available. The most important aspect of treatment involves activity management - which involves striking the right balance between activity and rest. This is known as pacing. Drugs can be used to help with symptoms such as pain and sleep disturbance. There is no form of curative treatment at present - although several drugs are being assessed in clinical trials."},{"url":null,"title":"she came flying out like","story":"NewsWoman blinded in one eye after \u0027being repeatedly hit with HAMMER\u0027 by \u0027psycho\u0027 beautician while looking for boyfriendThe victim was struck \"right in the eyeball\" after Samantha Goldring came \u0027flying out of her house like a psycho,\u0027 a court was told\u0026nbspShareByAshleigh Mcdonald07:54, 9 MAY 2018Updated08:19, 9 MAY 2018NewsSamantha Goldring who went on trial yesterday afternoon at Belfast Crown Court (Image: Photopress Belfast)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman who has been left blind in one eye after an alleged hammer attack told a court it\u0027s ruined my life.

The jury was told how she became involved in a fight with Samantha Goldring after going round to her house to look for her boyfriend. The woman was giving evidence at Belfast Crown Court, where her alleged attacker is standing trial on three charges arising out of the incident which occurred in the Woodvale area of the city last April. Samantha Goldring, 36, from Newtownabbey, has denied the charges - which include causing the other woman grievous bodily harm with intent and possessing an offensive weapon with intent - and claims she was acting in self defence. The injured woman, who is from Belfast, was questioned about events on the evening of Saturday, April 8 last year which resulted in her losing all her sight in her left eye. The court heard this damaged eye is being replaced with an artificial one, Belfast Live reports. When asked how the incident had left her feeling, the injured woman said: Well, being a girl and it being on your face, especially with your woman (Goldring) supposed to be a beautician... just a girl doing that to another girl then having to go through all this after it this whole year, it\u0027s ruined my life over the head of it.

The injured woman claimed that after she smashed the window, Goldring came running out of the house and struck her several times in the face and head with a hammer.

Kevin Cooper taught at the St James School in Grimsby until he was suspended in July 2016 when the nature of his relationship with the pupil came to light.  At a disciplinary panel by the Teaching Regulation Agency, Cooper was banned from teaching againafter being found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct which could bring the teaching profession into disrepute, reports the Grimsby  .  Cooper\u0027s relationship with the girl was described as sexually motivated and he admitted he hoped they could start a \u0027romantic relationship\u0027 when she left school.  The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) hearing in Coventry was told that he had also contacted the girl via social media and gone with her to London. Imposing the ban on behalf of the Education Secretary, TRA decision maker, Dawn Dandy, said the ban was both proportionate and in the public interest.  She said she had taken into account that the disciplinary panel had found that Mr Cooper lacked insight or remorse in respect of what he had done. In some cases when bans are imposed on teachers a period of years is set after which they can apply to another panel to have the ban lifted. But Ms Dandy said she considered that, in order to satisfy the maintenance of public confidence in the teaching profession, there should be no review period.

The Hollywood starlet, 36, best known for her role in hit series Suits, has wowed the world while accompanying husband-to-be Prince Harry at events across the globe. And since their engagement last November, excitement about the royal wedding has rocketed with fans, royal-watchers and media around the world fascinated by every last detail.  Meghan has already given up her acting career as she prepares to become an official royal, undertaking royal duties and charity work as a full-time job. But while her life has taken a dramatic aristocratic turn, the brunette-haired beauty has far more humble roots than Prince Harry.  The actress was born to Thomas Markle Snr and Doria Ragland in 1981, who divorced in 1987 - around 10 years after first meeting. Meghan has two half siblings, Samantha and Thomas Jnr, who are the children of Thomas Snr from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless. While Meghan\u0027s parents will attend the wedding together and her father will walk her down the aisle, her frosty relationship with her half-siblings mean they will not feature in her big day. Here, we\u0027ve taken a closer look at who Meghan Markle\u0027s family are. Doria Ragland, Meghan\u0027s age-defying yoga teacher mum  Meghan has previously gushed about her \u0027free spirit\u0027 yoga instructor mum, Doria Ragland, who lives in Los Angeles and rocks dreadlocks and a nose ring. We first got a glimpse of Doria at the Invictus Games last October. After 17 months of keeping a low profile while dating, Harry and Meghan stepped out together for their first properly public display of affection - and she brought her mum too. Meghan\u0027s mum is in her early 60s, but her youthful complexion makes her look more like a sister than a mother to Markle. Born in 1956, Doria later became a social worker and yoga instructor in California, and the latter might give us a clue to her age-defying physique.  She met Meghan\u0027s lighting director dad while working as an assistant make-up artist at ABC television. They married in 1979 and Meghan arrived in August 1981. The couple were to split citing irreconcilable differences when their daughter was just six. Meghan has previously revealed that her African-American mum used to be mistaken for her nanny, and that she was once called the N-word because she wasn’t pulling out of a parking space quickly enough for another driver. My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I’m half black and half white, Meghan wrote in an essay for Elle magazine. Being biracial paints a blurred line that is equal parts staggering and illuminating. While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I’m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.” Doria will be playing an important part in the royal wedding, accompanying Meghan in the bridal car on her way to the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle. Thomas Markle Snr, the reclusive dad who\u0027ll walk her down the aisle  Meghan\u0027s father was a workaholic who already had two children from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless when he met Doria. According to his son Thomas Jnr, his life was to change when Meghan came along.  “Before then, dad’s work took priority over everything, but she became his whole world,” he said. I remember when she came home from the hospital, he had decorated the bathroom with little angels and fairies. Like his daughter, Thomas Snr worked in entertainment, winning awards for his lighting direction. He worked on iconic America shows including Married with Children and General Hospital. The family\u0027s situation was to improve when Thomas Snr won \u0026pound560,000 on the lottery. This allowed Meghan to be privately educated, and she regularly visited the TV sets were her father worked, including Married With Children.  “There I was, behind the scenes of a glossy soap opera and a TV sitcom, surrounded by famous actors and their glam teams, multi-million dollar budgets, and crew lunches that always included filet mignon and enough sweets to make you think you were at Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory, Meghan on her blog, The Tig.  Thomas Snr\u0027s split from Doria was bitter and he decided to leave LA for Mexico after declaring himself bankrupt with credit card debts of \u0026pound24,180. He now lives a reclusive existence near Rosarito Beach.  There had been some debate about whether Meghan\u0027s 73-year-old dad would be lured from his retreat to walk her down the aisle. But Kensington Palace has confirmed he will be at her side on her big day. Thomas Snr will meet son-in-law to-be Prince Harry for the first time in the week before the wedding. Meghan\u0027s parents will also spend time with the Queen and Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.   Thomas Markle Jnr shares his moniker with his father, Thomas Snr. He was 14 when Meghan was born after his father met Doria Ragland in the late 1970s. Thomas Jnr then grew up in the same household as his father, sister Samantha, step-mother Doria and half sister Meghan. Now living in Oregon, the window fitter is married to Darlene Blout and has two sons of his own. While the world will watch his father walk Meghan down the aisle on May 19, Thomas Jnr will not attend the Royal wedding. The 51-year-old has reportedly battled alcohol issues in the past and was arrested in 2017 for threatening his wife with a gun. Thomas exclusively spoke to the Daily Mirror about the frosty relationship with Meghan. He said he was left \u0027deeply hurt\u0027 by the royal wedding snub and that fame had changed the American actress. Thomas Jnr said: She’s clearly forgotten her roots. It’s torn my entire family apart. He added: Meg likes to portray herself as a humanitarian, a people’s person and a charitable person but she is none of those things to her family. She is giving the greatest \u0026shyperformance of her life. She is acting phoney. Once she got into Hollywood she turned into a different person. He has gone so far as to write an open letter urging Harry to call of the wedding before it is too late.  Thomas Jnr was a little kinder during an interview he gave just after the news of the couple\u0027s relationship emerged.  It was just obvious from day one that she was destined to be somewhere really big. She\u0027s always been a princess. She\u0027s carried herself on that level from day one.” Thomas Jnr is currently estranged from his full sister Samantha, who he believes is trying to ride Meghan’s coattails. She\u0027s battered this whole Meghan thing since day one and she\u0027s obviously doing this for her little flash in the pan fame and fortune. Telling the whole world about her pushy princess sister, which is just horrible [and] not even true,” he said.  Samantha Grant - born Yvonne - lives in Florida and has three children.  She lived with Doria, Thomas Snr and her brother during Meghan\u0027s early years. But like her brother, she now has a difficult relationship with the bride-to-be and will not be at the wedding. Now a writer and counsellor, she is confined to a wheelchair after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2008  The 53-year-old claims she has not spoken to her half-sister for three years. All hell broke loose when she revealed plans to write a tell-all book entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy\u0027s sister.  She has also accused Meghan of behavior \u0027not befitting of a Royal family member\u0027 and accused her half-sister of distancing herself after the MS diagnosis.   However, Samantha did have some positive things to say during an interview with Good Morning Britain.  She\u0027s very strong she\u0027s very worldly and educated, graceful, Samantha told the show, discussing Meghan\u0027s future royal role as Harry’s wife. I think she will absolutely be a compliment to her role and I think the public will be surprised by how graceful and lovely she is. Despite the animosity, Samantha wanted a royal wedding invitation. She is not believed to have received one.  Tyler Dooley, the cannabis farmer nephew  Meghan Markle\u0027s 25-year-old nephew has revealed he is a proud cannabis farmer who will reportedly make a special potent batch of the drug called Markle\u0027s Sparkle. Tyler lives in Oregon, where recreational marijuana was made legal in 2015. Reports say Tyler is proud of being part of the industry, which remains illegal in the UK. The 25-year-old, who remembered being babysat by Meghan when he was a kid, told the Daily Mail : We are passionate about marijuana and all the good things it brings. Prince Harry enjoys a good party. I’d be happy to show them around if they ever come out here and educate them on the medicinal benefits of marijuana which helps everything from post-traumatic stress syndrome to insomnia to pain in cancer patients. Tyler, the son of Meghan’s half-brother Thomas Markle Jr, reportedly tried his first joint at high school but says he no longer uses the drug. Since it was made legal in his state, Tyler got involved in the business and is paid a commission for sales and marketing jobs. Frederick Markle, the \u0027recluse\u0027 bishop uncle with a \u0027congregation of one\u0027 Frederick Markle, 75, is the brother of Meghan’s dad, but their lives couldn’t be more different. While Thomas ’s career too him to Hollywood, Frederick’s took him to Sanford, Florida, where he runs a ramshackle chapel and goes by the name Bishop Dismas.

Natalie Agostinho has criticised the company after noticing one of their sponsored ads on Instagram. The woman in the ad is wearing a low-cut pink vest top, has a head full of curlers, her finger placed to her chin and is puckering up her shiny lips in a confused way, with the tag line \u0027do I need a financial advisor?\u0027. Natalie, 36, claims it suggests the woman has blown her cash on a hairdo and perpetuates the stereotype that millennial women can’t successfully manage their finances.  The company who created the advert, Local Financial Advice, said it regrets any offence caused by the advert, which was meant to portray a \u0027pondering\u0027 woman. The ad has now been pulled and a full review of the organisation’s sign-off process will take place.  Natalie, a HR manager from Manchester said: I thought it was going to be an advert for a blow dry at a salon but when I realised what it was for I got really cross.   It\u0027s that same old stereotype that women should leave men to do the financing because they aren\u0027t \u0027clever enough\u0027 to do it themselves.     It leaves girls looking like they are clueless and useless.   I think the way that the woman has her hair in rollers suggests that she has spent all her money on her hair and make-up and has no money left so needs a man to save her. It\u0027s insulting. The advert is saying that millennial women are more interested in their make-up than finances and are incapable of sorting it themselves, which is false. It\u0027s like we\u0027re all little airheads. I am personally really fed up with the daily sexism, it\u0027s all the same at the minute how women are treated and perceived. Natalie contacted Local Financial Advice on social media and claims she has yet to receive a response.  Natalie said: I haven’t heard anything from the company and don\u0027t expect to hear anything from them to be honest. We go through our whole life just dealing with daily sexism yet when we stop and think about it properly we realise we shouldn\u0027t have to go along with it. Women have to do a lot to try and prove themselves so we don’t live up to the stereotype that has been built. Companies having adverts like this really doesn\u0027t help us. What makes it worse is that as it’s a sponsored post it will only appear on a certain demographic\u0027s feed, which could be young females.

If you have a regular car licence you are restricted on what you can tow and an extra test is needed before you can get out on the road with a heavy trailer or caravan. The DVLA state that anyone issued with a regular Category B (car) licence after January 1, 1997 can tow a trailer that weighs up to 750kg, as long as their car has a maximum authorised mass of no more than 3,500kg, or a trailer over 750kg, where the combined weight of the trailer and towing vehicle is no more than 3,500kg. Maximum authorised mass means the total weight of a vehicle including its maximum load with the measurement found in the owner\u0027s manual for your car.  If you break these conditions you could face a \u0026pound1,000 fine and three penalty points. The average weight of a normal car is roughly 2,000kg, not including its loaded weight. This means motorists don\u0027t have much room to move up to anything larger than a loaded trailer. And while it doesn\u0027t rule out all caravans, larger ones would push the combined weight with the vehicle above 3,500kg, leaving the driver at risk of a fine. Drivers that wish to tow heavy trailers or caravans need to apply for an additional B+E condition on their licence, which involves taking another test. Those motorists who passed their test before 1997 already had this condition on their licence, which means they can usually drive a trailer and vehicle combination up to 8,250kg.  The RAC has a guide to help motorists work out their towing capacity .

Mr Fogleman, 36, said he spoke to the employee after his girlfriend had complained about their room after arriving at the hotel with his mother and young family because of a strong smell of smoke.

In fact, artists who have put pen to paper and brought the humble mouse to life have often called him Walt Disney\u0027s alter ego. Others say he represents the world of animation, and a poll found he was more \u0026shyrecognisable than Santa Claus. For such a tiny guy he holds a great deal of weight - not only in animation, but also for creating the idea behind the Disney magic. Walt Disney once said: “I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing, that it was all started by a mouse.” Mickey Mouse turns 90 this year and to mark the occasion we\u0027ve gathered together some facts you may - or may not - know about the popular rodent. 1. Mickey\u0027s debut  Mickey Mouse made his debut on November 18, 1928 in Steamboat Willie at the Colony Theatre, New York City. Steamboat Willie was the world\u0027s first cartoon with synchronised sound and featured Walt Disney\u0027s own voice for Mickey\u0027s squeaky noises.  2. He nearly wasn\u0027t called Mickey Walt Disney wanted Mickey to be called Mortimer Mouse but changed his mind after his wife Lillian said it sounded too arrogant and suggested a name that was more humble and fun. 3. Charlie Chaplin was an inspiration  Walt Disney said silent film star Charlie Chaplin was an inspiration for Mickey Mouse. Disney said: We wanted something appealing, and we thought of a tiny bit of a mouse that would have something of the wistfulness of Chaplin... a little fellow trying to do the best he could. Ub lwerks, the artist who helped develop it, said he thought people saw him as a dashing and heroic character. 4. It takes more than you think to draw Mickey  Creating Mickey is not as simple as drawing the famous large circle and two small circles. One cartoon could include 10,000 drawings for just seven and a half minutes and could take anywhere from six months to two years to finish.  Mickey started wearing those popular white gloves in the short video When the Cat\u0027s Away in Opry House on March 28, 1929. Since then he\u0027s carried on wearing them in most of his appearances. Very Michael Jackson.  6. His first live show Mickey Mouse made his first live, in-person (in-mouse?) appearance on March 12, 1931 in Los Angeles in a live stage show called the Mickey Mouse Idea. 7. He\u0027s been everywhere  Mickey isn\u0027t exactly screen shy. More than 100 Mickey cartoons were produced in the 1930s and were shown in theatres as films, newsreels and dramas and comedies. They were so popular that filmgoers would ask if the cartoon would be in the show before they actually bought a ticket according to Robert Tieman (author of The Mickey Mouse Treasures). 8. Mickey has a large family  We all know Donald and Goofy, but Mickey doesn\u0027t just have friends - he has a big family. His nephews Morty and Ferdie are the more well known, but there are also grandparents, a dozen cousins, uncles, including Uncle Maxwell, a professor called Cousin Digger, an Australian rancher and Uncle Louie, a French chef. 9. The Walk of Fame Mickey is the first cartoon character to get his own star on the Walk of Fame. The star was put in on November 18, 1978 to mark his 50th anniversary. If you want to see it, the star is located on 6295 Hollywood Boulevard. 10. When he turned 60 To mark Mickey\u0027s 60th birthday Mickey was given a place in the Smithsonian Institution. In 1988 Walt Disney Studios donated six original animation drawings from Steamboat Willie to the National Museum of American History. 11. The most successful Mickey merchandise is the watch While the iconic Mickey Mouse watch symbol is now a staple accessory - with even Apple using it - it wasn\u0027t always so. The original watch was produced by Ingersoll-Waterbury in 1933 and was sold for just $2.95. The company gave Walt Disney the 25millionth Mickey watch in 1957. That\u0027s a lot of watches. 12. From Black and White to Colour  Mickey appeared in black and white for the last time in Mickey\u0027s Kangaroo - and his first appearance in colour was in The Band Concert on February 23, 1935. 13. The sorcerer While we\u0027re all used to seeing Mickey as a cartoon one of his most famous roles was as the Sorcerer\u0027s Apprentice in Fantasia in 1940. In 1955, Mickey Mouse made his TV debut in The Mickey Mouse Club. 14. Lovers  Mickey and Minnie are actually married, but Walt never established their relationship on screen. In an interview in 1933 he said: In his private life, Mickey is married to Minnie...What it really amounts to is that Minnie is, for screen purposes, his leading lady. 15. Hidden Mickeys  Engineers that helped built the Disney theme park started a game called \u0027Hidden Mickeys\u0027. Anyone who has visited the parks will probably have spotted one or two Mickey ears dotted around the park. The famous silhouette is often in plain sight - a simple large circle and two smaller ones for ears. 16. Winning the awards Walt Disney earned an honorary Academy award in 1932 for creating Mickey Mouse. 17. Ever changing personality  Mickey was originally a cheeky anti-hero, but was re-branded as an everyman, a flawed but adventurous hero. He was re-branded again in 2009 where the emphasis was on the mischievous and adventurous side of his character. 18. Election fever In the US Mickey\u0027s name is often used as a protest vote. Instead of people ticking none of the above, they often opt to write in his name. An election supervisor in Georgia said: If Mickey Mouse doesn\u0027t get votes in our election, it\u0027s a bad election.  19. Mickey Mouse as slang The mouse\u0027s name is used often as slang or as a nickname. It means small-time, amateurish or trivial. In the UK it can mean counterfeit. In Australia it\u0027s used as something being very good - rhyming slang for grouse. In World War II the Motor Minesweepers used by the British Royal Naval Patrol Service were known as Mickey Mouses. In the Godfather Part II Fredo justifies betraying Michael by saying: Let Fredo take care of some Mickey Mouse night club somewhere! 20.

Little Spencer Devlin, whose dad is British, was tragically pronounced dead in hospital after plunging from the second-floor balcony last Saturday. His heartbroken family have described how he climbed through a window after his mother Holly Bishop opened it a little bit as she cleaned. The 18-month-old had reportedly been following Holly, 28, around as he always did in the moments before the tragedy in the Algarve region. After he went quiet and out of view, his mum initially thought he was getting up to mischief and searched for him, his aunt, Jess Marach, said.  But as she struggled to find him, she reportedly began to panic. She then noticed the window was “fully open” and ran over to look outside. Horrifically, she saw Spencer lying on the ground, surrounded by people. “[Holly] saw little Spencer on the ground outside with people surrounding him and she ran straight down the stairs to him,” Jess told news.au . The tot, whose breathing was laboured, was rushed to the local hospital before being transferred to Faro\u0027s Algarve University Hospital Centre. He sadly died as a result of his injuries. His mum Holly, from Perth, Australia, and dad Robert Devlin, from the UK, are said to have been left utterly devastated by his death.  The parents live in the holiday resort town of Lagos, where Robert, 32, runs a business and where the tragedy happened at the weekend. Recalling the moments leading up to Spencer\u0027s fall, Jess said Holly had opened the window a little bit to air the property and let the floors dry. “She said he was then playing in the bathroom banging around on the cupboards and she went to tell him to come out and he followed her back to the living room.  She then continued to clean the apartment and again couldn’t see Spencer or now hear him either, she told news.au. She went on to describe the horrifying moment Holly - her sister - discovered her little boy had fallen 25 feet from the balcony.  The tragedy was a freak accident, Jess told the news site, adding that Spencer, born in Portugal, was a happy and smiling youngster. A GoFundMe page has now been set up to help Holly and Robert pay funeral costs and other bills while grieving for their son. A post on the page, set up last Sunday, a day after Spencer\u0027s fall, reads: Yesterday was the worst day of rob and Holly’s life’s (sic). Yesterday morning their little baby boy Spencer had a tragic accident and was taken to faro hospital in Portugal where they did all they could for him but unfortunately he just couldn’t fight any longer and last night their beautiful baby boy Spencer grew his little wings and left all of his family behind. They are beyond devastated and would like to let everyone know but at the moment would just like some time to come to terms with their loss and be around family.

The woman, only known as Ms Wang, paid what she thought was a Japanese Spitz but grew suspicious when the animal stopped eating dog food at three months old. Chinese media reported that Ms Wang also noticed the \u0027puppy\u0027 never barked and its fur got thicker and tail longer than that of a normal dog. Eventually, her doubts were realised when an employee from a nearby zoo confirmed the pet was a domesticated fox, it was reported.  Ms Wang, from Jinzhong in China\u0027s Shanxi province, told Shanxi Network Television she bought the \u0027puppy\u0027 from a pet shop in July last year.   She said: The fur got thicker when it reached three months old. Its face became pointy and its tail grew longer than that of a normal dog. Before she learned the truth, Ms Wang said people using a park where she walked her pet told her that the animal was a fox. She added: Other pet dogs seemed to be scared by my pet so I walked it with a leash.  Ms Wang told Chinese media she fed the \u0027pooch\u0027 fruit, chicken breasts and dog food, which the pet stopped eating when it reached three months old. Sun Letian, an expert in animal epidemic prevention at Taiyuan Zoo, confirmed Ms Wang\u0027s pet is a fox after she brought her pet in for advice. He said: Based on the size, it is a domesticated fox. It carries a smell in their body and the smell can get stronger as it grows older.

A great player, he has to show that in this type of game.“I was not unsatisfied with his performance (on Tuesday) because he has come back from a long journey from injury.“It was not easy to make him fit physically.“He played 90 minutes and he was a good player for us.”United are set to go in tomorrow with no fresh injury worries from the first game.And defender Mark Durnan could be added to the squad after stepping up his training this week after suffering from a swollen ankle.He’s been out since the win over league champions St Mirren early last month.Tickets for tonight are on general sale from the club shop at Tannadice.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Netflix.jpg ","title":"how to find out if your netflix password has been compromised","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA list of more than 10,000 Netflix usernames and passwords have been posted online – including local users.The Evening Express reports that the massive file containing full email addresses and their linked passwords was posted online last month.It’s not known how up to date the data is, however, it’s worth checking to see if your details have been leaked.Popular site haveibeenpwned, allows users to enter their e-mail and see how many, if at all, their details have been compromised.Their database includes the massive Netflix list, as well as data from other major breaches including more than 65 million accounts from Tumblr which was released in 2013.Last week Twitter users were advised to change their passwords after an internal bug meant user details were visible internally.And earlier this year data of more than 150 million users of popular diet and fitness app MyFitnessPal was hacked.If you’re concerned your data has been leaked make sure to update your details across all acounts, using strong, unique passwords and two-factor authentication where possible.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man accused of putting his head through front door remanded in custody","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man has been remanded in custody pending trial at Dundee Sheriff Court on Thursday.Andrew Cussick, 32, of Lansdowne Square, denies that, on December 27, at Liff Crescent, he behaved in a threatening or abusive manner, repeatedly attended there uninvited, shouted and swore, struck a window with his hand or an unknown implement and attempted to gain entry, pushed his head through a hole in the front door and repeatedly uttered threats of violence.He also denies that he destroyed or damaged property and kicked a door and a fence there, causing damage, assaulted his partner Caroline Murphy and seized her by the clothing and possessed heroin.He further denies he breached bail on April 8 by entering Liff Crescent and Craigard Road and contacting Ms Murphy, and at Craigard Road, that he assaulted her and stole a handbag and its contents.He also denies possessing heroin at Buttars Street on the same date, while on bail.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"plan to turn derelict dundee plot of twenty years into car sales depot","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA plot of land that has lain unused for more than two decades near Dundee city centre could be turned into a car sales depot if plans are approved.An application has been made to Dundee City Council to transform the site behind 7 Guthrie Street into an internet car sales yard.Applicant Abdul Spingher was previously involved with the running of Sizzlers takeaway next door to the site, which is directly across from the junction with Session Street.He said his plan was to begin “modestly” with a view to building up the business over time, and hoped to be “up and running” in a matter of weeks.The 30-year-old said: “The yard has been lying unused like that for more than 20 years, to my understanding.“I saw it and thought, ‘it’s right in the public eye’ and realised I could get a fair bit of passing trade from it. That’s when I looked at the yard and realised it would have the potential for a car sales area.”The land is currently privately owned by a landlord in Leicester, Mr Spingher said, with neighbouring properties including Sizzlers owned by Dundee Central Mosque and leased out.A disused works lies next to the proposed site, and at the back is the car park adjacent to the mosque.Mr Springher added: “It’s needing a lot of work done to it as it’s full of junk at the moment. So there is a lot of clearing out that would need to be done.“There are also things like sewage and drainage and other things that need looked at.“I’m planning to start off fairly small, maybe with around 12 cars or so.

Now, though, we will fancy our chances going back to Tannadice.”And Fraser believes the United playing surface will give them an added advantage in the second leg.“It was a typical play-off. There’s a lot of pressure on teams in these situations and you know winning or losing can come down to small margins, so it was all a bit frantic at times.“We were trying to get our game going on a pitch that wasn’t great, so that was difficult and it suited them to put the ball in behind and run.“Tannadice should suit us better because our surface there is good and we can pass the ball. We’ll water the pitch and that will suit us when we get the ball down and try to pass it out from the back.”He’s also in no doubt knowledge gained from previous play-offs also has to give them an edge.“We do have a few boys who were in the play-offs last year with us or have played in them for other teams in the past and that helps. We know what to expect and how to handle it.“Last year at this stage we went down to Morton and got a good result, then came back to Tannadice and won well and we’ll be looking to do the same again tonight.“We’ve also got a lot of experienced boys like Scott McDonald, Bilel Mohsni and Willo Flood and they’re all a big help.”After his long injury lay-off because of well-documented problems with a broken foot, starting two games in three days will be a challenge, but he reckons he’s back to 100% fitness.“I’ve been working hard on it over the past couple of weeks and I was happy with the way I got through the 90 minutes on Tuesday.“We had the wee break last week in terms of no midweek game for a change and that meant I was able to put in some good work in training.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish football pays tribute to legendary dundee football writer ron scott","story":"\t\t\t\t\tScottish football has paid tribute to a respected and popular Dundee sports writer  who has died after a short illness.Ron Scott, a former chief football writer at the Sunday Post passed away in Ninewells Hospital on Sunday.
