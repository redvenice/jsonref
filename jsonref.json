Kate gazes adoringly at her newborn little...Kate Middleton royal baby LIVE: Latest news on new prince\u0027s...Share this articleAccording to a source, Kate and William are ‘very keen’ to make sure George and Charlotte are as involved as possible with their new brother, ‘hence the dash back to KP’ before bedtime last night.The couple are also determined to keep things as normal as possible for George, as he has just gone back to school for the summer term and they do not want his routine disrupted.For his part, William is good with the children in the nursery — one quality of his father Prince Charles that Diana acknowledged.    Prince George talks to his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth ahead of the Christening of his sister Princess Charlotte  Prince Charles with Prince William and Harry pictured inside Kensington Palace (left) and the family with Princess Diana (right)          The grounds of Kensington Palace where the new prince has been taken this evening following his arrival today           An official pictured released for Prince George\u0027s birthday           Prince George, wearing a white dressing gown, greets Barack and Michelle Obama          Prince George plays with the Cambridge\u0027s family dog Lupo in the grounds of Kensington Palace‘It’s the home of a modern couple, lots of photographs of the children and the bits of artwork they bring home from school,’ says a friend.‘It’s a welcoming home, but William does guard their privacy and he limits the number of outsiders who are let in to the family circle.’ Evenings are often spent in front of the television with a take-away curry from Malabar in Notting Hill — collected by one of the orderlies, not delivered.          George and Charlotte wait in the window of Kensington PalaceWilliam has succeeded in creating something of the warm family atmosphere he found with the Middletons when he first knew Kate. But, as working royals, he long ago accepted that his and Kate’s home could never be quite like theirs. He’s matched them in one area, however — like them, he now has three children.By last night everything had been made ready in the Peter Rabbit-themed nursery to welcome home George and Charlotte’s new baby brother. I gather there are some new additions to the nursery, but no fresh licks of paint.There are, however, lots of new soft toys already — some from George and Charlotte — and many baby presents have also been delivered to the Palace.Officially, the couple say they won’t be hiring a maternity nurse to help with the early days of the new arrival. Insiders say Kate plans to breastfeed her new baby, but no one would think less of her if she did decide to call in specialist help, particularly during the night (a maternity nurse will normally sleep with the newborn and take the baby to its mother to be fed).After the birth of Prince George in 2013, Kate was on her knees with exhaustion because he hardly slept, and wanted his mother’s constant attention.When George was born, William and Kate had the builders in at Kensington Palace and were still living in cosy two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage.They almost immediately headed off to the Berkshire home of the Duchess’s parents.          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pose for photographs in the garden of Kensington Palace with their son George and dogsBy the time Charlotte arrived two years later, the £4.5 million refurbishment of Apartment 1A had been completed. With five reception rooms, three master bedrooms with adjoining dressing rooms and bathrooms, there is certainly plenty of space.The imaginative transformation includes a night nursery where Charlotte and George sleep, and a day nursery for playtime.On the first floor are the master bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, and his-and-hers dressing rooms.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appeared in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where they live in Nottingham Cottage, after they announced their engagement.On the top floor, reached by a lift, are nine further bedrooms for staff, while a basement area where the photographer Earl of Snowdon once had his darkroom is now a well-appointed gym with laundry and luggage rooms nearby.The kitchen, on which the couple spent £170,000 of their own money, is the heart of this royal home, and where they like to entertain close friends and family.For more formal occasions guests, who arrive through a bright and airy entrance hall with intricate cornicing and black and white flagstones, are shown to one of the two drawing rooms — in one there is a grand piano and cream sofas with floral scatter cushions.Soon enough, the latest addition to the House of Windsor will no doubt be crawling all over them with mischief in mind."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/13/4B6C251F00000578-0-image-m-14_1524400230755.jpg","title":"Kate Middleton baby Prince Charles Middletons expected visit new royal baby","story":"Dress like a Duke in William’s blazer by Polo Ralph LaurenShop it here at MATCHESFASHION.COMThe whole Cambridge family were pictured at the Lindo wing at various points of the day that the newest addition arrived.

It detailed what had happened that evening when they had been out together.\u0027He seemed fine, then he brought up Doga and that he had met up with her in December,\u0027 he said.\u0027I had always told him to move on.\u0027Mr Howell and Mr Rauch had a number of drinks on the evening of January 1, before they parted to go to their respective homes at 10pm.Oxfordfshire coroner Darren Salter was told that Mr Rauch received a message from Mr Howell at 10.30pm, saying: \u0027I can\u0027t take Doga getting married.\u0027 When he woke up the next morning Mr Rauch sent a text at 8am which said: \u0027I\u0027m still drunk Mike.\u0027 Danish submarine inventor is jailed for life for murdering...\u0027If this happened in Sudan we\u0027d hang the killers\u0027: Family of...Share this articleThere was no response to this and mobile phone Whatsapp records indicated it was not opened by Mr Howell. Sometime the previous evening Mr Howell sent a text to a group chat for his house which was described by his mother and coroner Mr Salter as \u0027nonsensical.\u0027This was the last communication from Mr Howell, the inquest was told.When his housemates returned after the Christmas holiday and New Year period on January 3, they thought that Mr Howell had travelled abroad, even though his mother said his car was parked outside.One housemate, Stephanos Aradipiotis, a research engineer, became worried for Mr Howell\u0027s welfare and checked on his room but the door was locked.\u0027I came back after the New Year and at one point I began to worry about Mike,\u0027 Mr Ardipiotis said in his statement.\u0027He was the only one in the house over the New Year. I went to check the bathroom and at about 2.45pm on January 4 and found him hanging there.\u0027Mr Ardipiotis cut Mr Howell down and called an ambulance but he was declared dead at 5.10pm at the house.                             He seemed fine, then he brought up Doga and that he had met up with her in December,\u0027 he said. \u0027I had always told him to move on                        A toxicology report into Liverpool-born Mr Howell\u0027s death found that he had 179 milligrams of alcohol in his blood, with the drink-drive limit being 80 milligrams.A post mortem examination found the medical cause of death to be hanging.Mr Salter said: \u0027He died overnight on the first or second, most likely but I cannot say for sure.\u0027When the family raised a question about whether Mr Howell could have been found earlier, the coroner said: \u0027There was the belief that he had gone abroad.\u0027Michael was upset because of events with his ex-girlfriend but he had no previous suicidal idolisation and did not leave a suicide note.\u0027He hanged himself and that is a very final act.

What about other terminally ill children, the greiving families we know nothing about? What about the seriously ill teenagers and young people at Alder Hey?This case is consuming huge medical and legal resources as (increasingly) parents with terminally ill children (like the tragic case of Charlie Gard at Great Ormand Street) challenge experts and demand the right to intervene.I do not have children, so you might think I can’t speak from experience - but that’s not the case.            The family of terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans have released pictures of the little boy clinging to life in his mother\u0027s arms 10 hours after his life support was removedI married a wonderful man whose 7 year old son had suffered brain damage shortly after birth, a condition that was not immediately spotted by the hospital. My step-son had an operation to reverse the fluid on his brain, but was left with disabilities and learning difficulties.Bunny was a wonderful child, and his condition wasn’t life-threatening - he went to a special school and loved music.Aged 11, he was rushed to hospital with suspected appendicitis - following an exploratory operation the doctors told us he had terminal stomach cancer.He died two weeks later, after the longest fortnight of my life.Unlike Alfie’s mum and dad, my husband and his former partner did not attack the doctors and question their diagnosis, they did not demand surgery (having been told the cancer was too advanced).My job was to comfort and support my husband through this nightmare - with its inevitable painful conclusion.Piers Morgan says that in Alfie’s case ‘love must prevail’ and that the doctors should let the parents do whatever they want.That is nonsensical - this is not a war between right and wrong, and that position implies that doctors will never love a child as much as parents.Doctors take an oath to always act in the best interests of a patient - and Alfie’s interests have been represented separately in court.Alfie’s quality of life is paramount - and for his father to say ‘he’s breathing, he’s not suffering’ yesterday after he was taken off a ventilator is plainly wishful thinking.It denies the hard reality that sometimes a doctor will know your child better than you, and understand medical suffering better than you.If you are truly religious and believe in an afterlife, then you will not fear death and nor should you project fear onto a child.Death is inevitable, and the limited time remaining before Alfie’s death should be a quiet time to celebrate his life and treasure these moments forever, not make plans to whisk him away to another country on a wild goose chase.The hardest thing in the world is to let go, to accept that there’s nothing more you can do except give love.My husband managed to do that - at tremendous cost - and I wish that Tom and Kate could put their child first and do the same."},{"url":null,"title":"Fleetwood Mac tour Tickets dates announced Lindsey Buckinghams departure","story":"Golden State Killer: Everything you need to know about the caseFleetwood Mac tour: Tickets and dates announced after Lindsey Buckingham\u0027s departureKate Middleton: Why don\u0027t we call her the Duchess of Cambridge?Kevin Feige reveals Captain Marvel details at Avengers: Infinity War premiereIs Miami Heat\u0027s Dwyane Wade retiring from the NBA?Inside the secrets of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#8217s weddingWho is Meek Mill and why was he in prison?

Par for the course.After mention of both Mrs May and Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Mr Corbyn screamed: ‘Is it not time she took responsibility and resigned?’ It was not clear who that ‘she’ referred to – Theresa or Amber? Miss Rudd, brightening momentarily, pointed between herself and the PM, as if to say ‘which of us do you want to resign, mate?’Questions about the customs union came from the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford (who does not deserve the rude groans which greet him every week), and a couple of Tory Brexiteers, Richard Drax (S Dorset) and Julian Lewis (New Forest E). Mrs May’s replies on this matter were a little less emphatic than they had been in the past.But Mr Lewis did eventually get her to say the following: ‘I am very happy to confirm what I have always said – no deal is better than a bad deal. Being in a customs union means we would not be able to negotiate our own trade deals around the rest of the world and we want to be able to do that.           Diane Abbott responding to a statement by Home Secretary Amber Rudd in the House of CommonsAs I saw at the Commonwealth meeting, there is considerable interest around the rest of the world in being able to have those independent trade deals.’ Pin that on your fridge door and let’s see if she keeps to that position in a few months’ time.Not a single MP asked about the sad case of Alfie Evans, the desperately ill little boy whose family were told by the courts that they must not take him abroad for further medical treatment.Perhaps it was too distressing a subject for parliamentary debate at this time. But does it not raise unresolved arguments about the power of the state versus the freedom of parents? When that state power becomes caught up with doctors, does this affect how we see medics? Do they become family doctors or state doctors?Liz McInnes (Lab, Heywood \u0026amp Middleton) asked about Government policies on making us less fat. She wanted to ‘tackle junk-food marketing’. Mrs May trotted out a reply about officialdom’s efforts to reduce sugar consumption and to get the populace to take more exercise. It did not, regrettably, tilt a wing acknowledging the philosophical boundaries to this sort of state power.To what extent should politicians control what the public eats, or indeed what we may do to secure our children medical help? There may be no easy answer but it would at least be good, just sometimes, to hear a parliamentarian defend personal responsibility and liberty. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/19/4B7BAB0B00000578-0-image-m-16_1524680664691.jpg","title":"Toddler Alfie Evans survives night without life support","story":"Alfie Evans updates: Police hold back angry protesters as they make stand outside Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital - Mirror Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/10/4B7BAB0B00000578-0-image-a-8_1524650164334.jpg","title":"Vets assistant 28 finally gets tongue split like snakes","story":"    Veterinary Assistant James Reeve-Shillito, 28, from Peterborough had part of his tongue removed using a scalpel last year in a 20-minute procedure in LondonThis daring British man voluntarily underwent surgery to give him a permanent snake-like split tongue.Veterinary assistant James Reeve-Shillito, 28, from Peterborough had part of his tongue removed using a scalpel last year in a 20-minute procedure in London.Mr Reeve-Shillito, who lives with his partner David, developed a taste for body mods at an early age, having his first tattoos and piercings at the age of 14.He had wanted to get his tongue split since he was 13 years old, but felt it was too extreme, before finally plucking up the courage to go through with his long-held ambition last year.\u0027I first became interested in tattoos and piercings because I wasn\u0027t allowed them when I was younger,\u0027 he recalled.\u0027I eventually got my ear pierced when I was about 14 and my first tattoo at 14.

I had just got my first car: an enormous 1999 Crown Victoria, an ex-police car I bought off a Russian cab-driver in North Hollywood for $900. Why Philly? I had a mate living there, so with my new wheels I figured this was an ideal time to hit the road and see the country. It turned out to be fairly gruelling. I’d miscalculated the distance – and the quality of my vehicle – so what I thought would be a three-day drive was a solid five-day slog with little time for stopping. It was intense: a foot-down, white-knuckle, bald-tyres, 4,000-mile drive.Minneapolis was one of the few stops I made, four days in. It was a crisp Sunday morning and I decided to go for a wander with my camera. The streets were empty. It was a ghost town: there was nothing catching my eye. Then I turned a corner and was met with this scene in front of the courthouse: barristers marching around and maybe 60 or 70 Muslims milling about, the women separate from the men. I had no idea what was going on but things seemed a little tense.I knew I only had seconds to get this shot. I walked towards them, lifted my camera and managed to get one photo before they got up and moved. You can see in the image that the women in black look like they’re trying to hide – they weren’t happy I was taking a picture. The one in pink didn’t move, though. She just stared right back at me, which I think is what makes the image interesting. To me, she serves as a bridge: at a time when there is so much Islamophobia and judgment in the western world towards Muslims, it was a moment of connection.Later that day, I looked into what had been happening: it turned out a couple of Somali Americans had been accused of funnelling money to some extremist groups in Somalia. The court was in session and this group of women were the wives, family and friends of the men involved.I don’t trawl the streets looking for this kind of thing, but the subject matter is as interesting as the composition itself. I didn’t crop it, although I may have straightened up some of those lines. Taking photos of people when they don’t want you to isn’t my favourite thing. And the truth is, most people don’t want you to take their photo. But if you ask someone, often you lose whatever it was you wanted to capture. And there’s the rub. You can say that it’s in the cause of art, and this noble profession of documenting the world, which is an important thing to do. But I don’t think that gives you licence to do whatever you like. The key here was proximity: I was maybe 70ft away. I wasn’t in these people’s faces. I don’t think I was making them physically uncomfortable. I’m happy to photograph people from a distance.There are, of course, brilliant American photographers capturing life in the US. But personally, I’ve always been triggered by being in a foreign place. I am more likely to be analytical, to notice every little thing.

The Tidelines series is a collection of water-damaged photographs that provide a moving testament to the memories of family life before the floods.Exhibited in the depths of the disused ice factory is the astonishingly personal work by Alberto Garcia-Alix. Renowned for his raw, hedonistic portraiture, the maverick Spanish photographer’s early images focus on some of the people in his life. The photos set the scene for a dreamlike, retrospective film that is woven together with video, still images and his poetic narration, detailing a life led against the grain of convention and the lost aspirations of youth.Regarded as one of the most radical and influential photographers of his generation, the Fukase retrospective is a festival highlight. The extensive exhibition features the acclaimed series Ravens, which explores the artist’s battle with depression, as well as his vivid photographs showing the wild side of his beloved cat, Sasuke. The jewel in the crown is his early colour work, which was previously published but never exhibited. Viewed in its entirety, the Fukase display gives a deeper understanding of the variety and complexity of the photographer’s work.Izumi Miyazaki, one of the rising stars of the festival, is also the star of her work. Reminiscent of Magritte, at first glance her vivid use of colour and character seems whimsical, but her intent is a serious exploration of surrealism that leaves the viewer charmed and unsettled in equal measure. Miyazaki draws inspiration from her daily life, including what she has eaten.The Kyoto central wholesale market is the inspired venue for K-Narf’s tribute to the proud work ethic that is respected in Japanese culture. On the opening day of the festival, the photographer’s almost lifesize portraits of market traders caused a stir of excitement as members of the local community recognised their friends and colleagues. The project is centred on the local people and preserving their respect for the next generation, K-Narf says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d8dd52a1cd9645393b0eb695e6609f2604b9e0/0_0_2000_1578/master/2000.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=197446598f500badda02cd1acae9f2da","title":"george rr martin winds winter not coming 2018 sixth volume game thrones targaryen","story":"But it won’t be The Winds of Winter, the planned sixth volume of the series. Instead author has revealed a history of the Targaryen dynasty, due in NovemberGeorge RR Martin told fans today that the long-awaited sixth volume in his Game of Thrones fantasy series, The Winds of Winter, would not be published this year – but softened the blow by revealing that his “imaginary history” of the Targaryen family in Westeros would be released on 20 November.Fire and Blood is set 300 years before the events of A Song of Ice and Fire and, said its publishers Bantam and Voyager, will chronicle “the Targaryen civil war that nearly ended their dynasty forever”. In a post on his blog, Martin described the book as his “the GRRMarillion (or the first half of it, at least) that is to say, my version of Tolkien’s mammoth history of Middle Earth”, and revealed it ran to almost 1000 manuscript pages. He first mentioned the volume, the first of a planned two histories of Westeros, last summer, saying at the time that he was not sure if it, or The Winds of Winter, would be released first in 2018.Today, he confirmed that fans would have to content themselves with the history, for this year at least. The fifth book in the sequence on which the hit HBO series Game of Thrones is based, A Dance With Dragons, was published in 2011, with the television series now taking Martin’s characters far beyond the places they have reached in the books.“No, winter is not coming … not in 2018, at least. You’re going to have to keep waiting for The Winds of Winter. You will, however, be able to return to Westeros this year,” Martin said today. He stressed to fans that the book was not a new slice of narrative fiction set in the Game of Thrones world. “I do want to stress... indeed, I want to shout... that Fire and Blood is not a novel. This is not a traditional narrative and was never intended to be… let’s call this one ‘imaginary history’ instead. The essential point being the ‘history’ part. I love reading popular histories myself, and that’s what I was aiming for here,” he wrote on his blog. “So: not a novel. Everyone clear on that? (Though there are enough stories here for twenty novels. Battles, bloodshed, betrayals, love, lust, horror, religious wars, politics, incest, historical revisionism, all the fun stuff).”The book, he revealed on his blog, would cover “all the Targaryen kings from Aegon I (the Conquerer) to the regency of Aegon III (the Dragonbane), along with their wives, wars, siblings, children, friends, rivals, laws, travels, and sundry other matters … Oh, and there are dragons too. Lots of dragons.”Voyager and Bantam described the book as the “definitive history of the Targaryens in Westeros”. “Readers may have glimpsed small parts of this narrative before, in The World of Ice and Fire and various anthologies, but the full tapestry of Martin’s history of the Targaryens is revealed here for the first time,” said the publishers, who will release the book on 20 November, with 75 new illustrations from the artist Doug Wheatley.Martin did not reveal if the prequels to Game of Thrones which are currently being developed by HBO would be based on material from Fire and Blood. “It’s a logical question. The only answer I can give is… ah, well, no one is sure yet, and anyway, I am not allowed to say. So let’s move that to the side,” adding: “As for me, I’m returning once again to The Winds of Winter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a30905547f41cd434ba8905d9734729b02d5f088/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a4aa0b710bcb07dd380009c99450bde","title":"tsb online banking mobile app paul pester business live","story":"Some customers find that internet banking is restricted - or still not working, despite CEO saying it’s up and runningIn theory, TSB customers have another hour to call the bank for help before customer services closes for the day, at 11pm.In practice, there’s a long queue, and no certainty of getting through eventually....Radio producer Amanda Redman is just one of many customers to report that TSB is giving her inaccurate information when she logs in:This whole IT migration fiasco is a setback for TSB’s attempts to challenge Britain’s larger banks, says the Financial Times tonight.A person briefed on the TSB board’s plans insisted the platform had not been rushed out, and said questions over who was responsible would have to wait until the system was running smoothly for all its customers: “Given the testing they didn’t think this was where they were going to end up — they never would have pushed the button otherwise,” the person said.“It’s getting a bit better but there’s still some way to go . . . we’ve got to get to a point where things are stable, the backlogs are cleared, and then we can start an inquest.”TSB is facing more criticism from MPs tonight, over its failure to migrate smoothly onto a new IT system.Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake told the Daily :It doesn’t seem sensible that TSB took a big bang approach to this switch.This is simply not acceptable.

Therefore, can this be counted as my own, semi-empowered choice, or am I kidding myself and submitting to the patriarchy? Lia, age 15What a terrific question, Lia! I often think that all those tedious oldsters who wang on about how young people today are narcissistic snowflakes who only care about how many likes they get on Instagram really should spend some time with actual young people instead. Because, if they did, they would see that young people are so much more engaged and curious about the world than any teenagers I knew in the 1990s, primarily including myself there. I mean, I kept myself busy as a teenager: wondering whether I fancied Graham or Damon more (Graham, always) clearing my Friday nights for a big night in watching Whose Line is it Anyway? and Eurotrash or getting various parts of my body pierced at Kensington Market. But worrying about patriarchal groupthink I was not.You know, Lia, you can spend a lot of time getting all Chomsky on yourself, worrying about whether you think and behave the way you do because you have been brainwashed by the culture around you, or, conversely, whether you are the unique soul who has the mental strength to fight against this. Can I suggest an alternative perspective? Be aware of the influencers around us, sure, but trust yourself and your fine mind to maintain your inidual agency. Any 15-year-old who worries about patriarchal brainwashing is not going to fall for a boohoo advertising campaign. Equally, do not operate under the bad-faith assumption that anyone who thinks or dresses differently from you is a sleepwalking, mainstream fool. Accepting your and others’ inidual agency means accepting that everyone should take responsibility for their actions. Putting theirs down to them being brainwashed by the patriarchal overlords lets everyone off the hook. Own your choices, Lia, and do others the respect of letting them own theirs.As to your clothes: yes, of course, you are influenced by the fashion industry. After all, you can only wear what you can buy in the shops, and the shops are the fashion industry so, unless you want to be one of those people who get interviewed on daytime TV because they insist on dressing as badgers, what choice do you have? But this does not mean you are not making a choice. After all, you are not buying everything in the shops are you? You are making choices from the options available. This is not submitting to the patriarchy this is opting against the badger onesie.But let’s talk about the patriarchy, shall we? Sure, some clothes are definitely aimed at the male gaze, but a vast amount are not. As websites such as Man Repeller have celebrated, and as endless men have groaned about, quite a lot of fashion is not about looking sexy – it is about looking weird. Prada, Comme des Garçons and Junya Watanabe are just some of the high-end labels that have built their success on rebelling against conventional ideas of sexiness. But aside from that, even if the fashion industry was entirely concerned with the male gaze, the only question you have to ask yourself is why you choose the clothes you wear. Do you want to make every boy stare at you? Or do you just like that jumper, no matter what the boys think? If the former: yes, that is a bit tragic. If the latter, enjoy your jumper!Finally, one last thought. You ask if your clothes can be your “semi-empowered choice”. I realise we live in an era in which anything, from taking selfies to buying shoes, can be described as “empowering”, but this is, really, just nonsense. Empowerment is about revolution for the group, it is not about shopping for the inidual. So do not worry about self-empowerment when you are shopping just think about buying the things that you genuinely love. And enjoy them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0394e7c40126085879289e828deed1196e0630a6/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2126e6a9e2013db0d760ada484b63e6c","title":"biggest style secret designer meghan markle royal wedding dress","story":"With less than a month to go until the royal wedding, speculation is mounting, with Stella McCartney, Erdem and Christopher Bailey among the runners and ridersThe London-based label designed by thirtysomething Australian couple Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo is the odds-on favourite. Britain’s only haute couture house would be a patriotic choice with a full-service couture atelier handily situated close to Markle’s Kensington home. What’s more, the aesthetic – think superyacht glamour – has the requisite scale for the cathedral proportions of St George’s Chapel. January’s haute couture show closed with a wedding dress in double-faced duchess satin with a draped sweetheart bodice embroidered with Swarovski jewelled leaves, grand flounced skirt with pearlescent micro beads and scalloped lace veil. A semi-sheer black gown by Ralph \u0026amp Russo was the most eyecatching look in the couple’s portfolio of engagement photos. A “well-placed source” has apparently been briefing the press from the atelier that there is “talk of lace”, possibly the least revealing revelation in bridal fashion history. The duo have “declined to comment”.The woke choice. The strongest statement Markle could make would be to emphasise ethics with a sustainable, ethically sourced and made gown by Stella McCartney. When I interviewed her last week, McCartney definitely did not deny being The One. (On the other hand, having your name on lists like this one is good PR, so why deny it, even if the phone never rang?) Markle has worn Stella McCartney several times, including the caped gown she chose for the Queen’s birthday party at the weekend. Plus, the McCartneys are, in a way, British royalty. But while McCartney has made wedding dresses, including a corsetted gown with a long train for Madonna’s Scottish castle wedding in 2000, she is not really known for frills or romance. Her sleek, streamlined aesthetic is a more natural fit for Markle’s everyday wardrobe than for a wedding day. Very possibly a contender for a slinky gown for the evening reception.A persistent outlying rumour links Christopher Bailey, the outgoing Burberry designer, with the wedding dress. Bailey has a longstanding relationship with Markle, having dressed her character on Suits. “I wear a lot of Burberry on the show because Rachel’s whole aesthetic is someone who comes from money and has a real classic design sensibility,” Markle has said. Points in favour: Burberry is a marquee name of British fashion the fashion industry would be utterly charmed by a royal swansong for the universally liked Bailey he is a discreet, mature character who could handle the palace and be trusted to keep a secret. Burberry is known for trenchcoats, not fairytale glamour gowns, but Lily James’s inky red-carpet showstopper at February’s Baftas was by Burberry. So you never know. Backstage after Erdem’s most recent London fashion week show, he explained that his inspiration this season was Adele Astaire, Fred Astaire’s sister, who married into the British aristocracy. Later that day, at a fashion week reception at Buckingham Palace, his long-term client the Duchess of Cambridge made a beeline across the room for a chat. So I did ask, obviously, but he just giggled and raised his eyebrows. Make of that what you will. Erdem has Canadian connections in common with Markle, who lived in Toronto for six years. She has also worn Erdem’s clothes for years, choosing a printed maxi-dress for a wedding she attended with Harry in Jamaica last year. The recent expansion of Erdem’s small London team has added fuel to this fire. Aesthetically, this would be the most fashion-forward choice. Last year, he took the young Queen Elizabeth’s meeting with Duke Ellington at a jazz club as a starting point for a catwalk collection of rewired, quirky royal glamour. A charteuse silk gown with a tulip shaped skirt featured dense black embroidery and three outsize red silk bows at the breastbone, worn with flat mules and a quiff. Two words: Norman Hartnell. The logic against Sarah Burton creating a spectacular Alexander McQueen gown for the royal wedding is that Burton created a spectacular Alexander McQueen gown for the last royal wedding seven years ago. But history shows that this does not rule Burton out. Norman Hartnell designed the Queen’s wedding dress in 1947, and her sister Margaret’s in 1960. A second dress commission would strengthen the ties between the royal family and Alexander McQueen, perhaps the most iconic British fashion label of modern times. The royal family set a lot of store by trust, and Burton did an exemplary job both of designing the dress and of not breathing so much as a word about it. The “Fab Four” of William and Kate plus Harry and Meghan is a compelling new framing of the royals, and this would give it an elegant symmetry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a101f4ff3abc24541e7476bd7dac5296a7915884/0_110_5102_3060/master/5102.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0dec33bce1077a21395e3b0425ab144","title":"nico 1988 film velvet underground tribeca","story":"The director and star of a drama about the latter years of the cult singer talk about her unusual life and how she battled against her beauty• Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the dayAccording to the director of a daring new movie about Nico, the most notable aspects of the late singer’s life had nothing to do with the Velvet Underground, Andy Warhol, or her glamorous roles as model and muse. “Most people think that after her experience with the Velvet Underground and the Factory, Nico simply ‘became a fat junkie’ and disappeared,” said Susanna Nicchiarelli. “But to me, the second part of her life is so much more interesting than the first. That’s when she really became herself.”Not that it’s an entirely pleasant, fair or rational person that she became. That’s made clear in Nico 1988, which makes its US debut this week at the Tribeca film festival before a summer release. Unlike every previous dramatic portrayal of the star, which focused on her Dolce Vita years, when she attracted lovers from Jim Morrison to Jackson Browne to Alain Delon, Nico 1988 chronicles the final two, uncelebrated years of life. By then, she was an addict, shooting heroin into whatever covert part of her body she hadn’t yet poked. Nico was also overweight and, sometimes, malodorous. “I very rarely take showers,” her character boasts in the film.As a personality, Nico is often portrayed in the movie as obstinate, self-involved, paranoid and reckless. But she also displays a punky defiance and she had enough focus to create some of the most unusual, important andmost personal music in her career, on solo albums like The Marble Index, Desertshore and The End. At her concerts in the 80s, several of which I caught in New York, Nico exuded a morbidity so transfixing it later inspired some observers to cite her as the first goth, presaging artistic ghouls from Siouxsie Sioux to Bauhaus. As portrayed in the film, Nico also possessed an inner life as strange and haunted as her music. It’s captured in exquisite detail by the Danish actor Trine Dyrholm, who plays the star and sings all of her songs. Though she neither looks like nor sounds exactly like Nico, she nails her sad and dreamy core. Finding the right approach for the vocals proved tricky. The clumsiness of Nico’s singing meant that recreating it precisely could have seemed like a satire. Somehow Dyrholm found a sweet spot between accuracy and invention – as well as between sincerity and irony. “When she sang, Nico was often out of tune, and sometimes she sounded really awful,” Dyrholm said. “But that doesn’t matter. She told a story in her songs. I viewed her songs as monologues to capture the emotional state of the character.”Her state often reflected a hard past. The movie opens with a scene of a young Nico watching her city, Berlin, burn at the end of the second world war. “She was old enough at the time to understand what the defeat of her country meant,” Nicchiarelli said. “She grew up in terrible conditions. She suffered hunger. That was something that shaped her character.”Nico also struggled with guilt over her father’s role in the war. She often lied about his circumstances, falsely reporting to many that he helped rescue Jews. “It’s interesting that Nico was born in 1938 and died in 1988, a year before the end of the cold war,” Nicchiarelli said. “She never saw her country reunified. It’s as if the war never ended for her.” During much of the time that the film takes place, Nico lived in Manchester, a city she tells a local radio DJ she had chosen because it reminded her of the ruined Berlin. Other parts of the interview demonstrate her frustration with the endless interviewers who only want to know about the Velvet Underground. When the DJ introduces her as “Lou Reed’s femme fatale,” she barks: “Don’t call me that.” When asked if she wants to talk about the Velvet Underground, she growls: “No, I don’t.” And after the DJ rudely muses that 1968 must have been the best year of her life, she drily sneers: “Well, we took a lot of LSD.” “I like the fact that she’s not a pleaser,” Dyrholm said. “She’s a no bullshit type.” At the same time, Dyrholm admits “she’s obviously not likable”. Nicchiarelli calls Nico “infuriating”. Much of the movie follows the singer on the road in Europe, as she tussles with her band, a largely untalented group of misfits. It’s much the same ground covered by the 1993 memoir The End, written by the group’s keyboardist, James Young. While Young’s vivid account couldn’t be more withering, or hilarious, Nicchiarelli takes a more balanced approach. She finds an earnest core for her story by spending key time on Nico’s relationship with her son, Ari, with whom she reunited late in her life. Born out of wedlock, Ari is widely reported to have been fathered by Delon, though the French actor has always denied it. Even so, his parents wound up raising the boy when Nico proved unfit for the task. “I believe the love of her life was Ari,” Nicchiarelli said. Ari has seen the film and, according to the director, came away greatly impressed by Dyrholm’s interpretation of his mother. Nico suffered significant guilt over her inability to care for her son, blaming herself for the mental health problems he faced, which are harrowingly depicted in the film. The movie also deals with Nico’s battle against her beauty. “She wanted to destroy it,” Dyrholm said. “Imagine being so beautiful that it becomes a burden.”Nicchiarelli sees in Nico’s rejection of beauty a kind of strength. “While many women and men don’t accept that we change, she dealt with it,” she said. “At the same time, she was very careful about her new look. She always dyed her hair and she always wore makeup, even if it was weird. She would paint her face white.”Before the end of her life, Nico cleaned up to some degree by switching to methadone. She was staying with Ari in Ibiza when she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, leading to her death. The music she made in her later years, culminating in 1985’s Camera Obscura, got at something dangerous and deep. “In her music, you can hear that she’s carrying around a knowledge of death,” Dyrholm said. “She had this deep darkness in her but also a really strong energy.”“Ultimately, what I like about her is that she’s not the cliche of the fragile woman,” Nicchiarelli said. “She knew what she wanted. She wanted to make her own music, and she did it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cc1329955f64b1f583a81696403febf14b89a2d/316_57_1956_1174/master/1956.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb5b14541fec30bd5eb3088ab4167f5a","title":"arsene wenger leave arsenal not my decision","story":"Arsène Wenger believes it would be “even better” for Arsenal if they appoint a former player to succeed him as manager at the end of the season. He also provided the clearest indication yet that he did not want to step down, by revealing the timing of the decision was not down to him.Wenger was in relaxed mood before Thursday night’s Europa League semi-final first leg at home against Atlético Madrid – a tie he feels he has to win in order to avoid an anti-climatic conclusion to his near 22-year tenure.It promises to be an intriguing contest in which Wenger is set to start with David Ospina in goal a surprising move, given the manager played Petr Cech in both legs of the quarter-final against CSKA Moscow.But, perhaps inevitably, the focus remained on the fallout from the announcement last Friday that Wenger was set to leave his post and the discussion as to the identity of his successor.The favourite to take over is Luis Enrique, the former Barcelona manager whose credentials are being pushed by Raul Sanllehi, Arsenal’s new head of football relations. Sanllehi worked with Enrique at Barcelona and Wenger said he had a “high opinion” of him. But the merits of the former Arsenal captains Patrick Vieira and Mikel Arteta have also been advanced.Vieira, the manager of New York City, said on Wednesday that he was flattered to have been linked. “It’s not something which will stop me doing what I am doing at the moment,” he said. “I don’t want this to be perceived that I want to go because I don’t want to leave. But if the question is as simple as: ‘Are you ready to manage any teams in Europe?’ then I would say: ‘Yes. I am ready.’”Wenger has said he will play no part in the recruitment of the new manager but when asked about Vieira and Arteta – the latter is a coach at Manchester City – it was interesting to hear the 68-year-old endorse the notion of a former player, even if they might be less heralded in managerial terms. Arsenal, famously, made the bold move to appoint him in 1996, when ‘Arsène Who?’ was the question on many people’s lips.“The need is to make the right decision, even if you have to be bold,” Wenger said. “Is it former people that worked here? That is even better. But there are many players who had qualities. Some of them are in the job. I don’t influence that choice but I will stand behind the decision.”When Wenger and the club made the announcement that they would go their separate ways, the understanding was he had jumped before he was pushed.Wenger was asked on Wednesday why he was quitting when he had another year to run on his contract. “The timing was not really my decision,” he replied. Arsenal later argued that Wenger’s comment related to the release of the announcement rather than the decision. “After reaching agreement about my departure, I was happy for the club to decide when to announce,” Wenger later said in a statement. “I wish to make it clear the timing of the announcement was right.”He also made it plain he intended to seek another job in management – “I\u0026nbspwill continue to work, that’s for sure” – but he suggested he might need a period of reflection. “I had no break for 35 years. In our job – you can look around – that doesn’t exist. I don’t know now how addicted I am. I am a bit like a guy who plays Russian roulette every week and suddenly has no gun any more. I will see how much I miss that gun.”There were moments of levity, including one when Wenger predicted the club would have no shortage of managerial applicants. “That shows you the place is a good place. Green outside, nice trees, good grass. Fantastic. No pollution. Until the press conference starts.”The broader point Wenger sought to make was his successor would have a wonderful chance to be successful because he had helped to create such a powerful squad and club. The hurt of the looming separation is clear. Wenger continues to feel the urge to justify himself and his record. “I am convinced in the future, with two or three additions, this team has the quality to fight for the title.”Wenger listed his greatest regret as the 2006 Champions League final defeat against Barcelona, which had come after a couple of highlights – the knock-out wins over Real Madrid and Juventus. “If you look at Arsenal and the number of games they play in Europe in their whole history, it is not Real Madrid. The history of the club has become very demanding but the longer history is not so bright that you can say the club has won 10 European Cups.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9a13fc854086d3a7b4b059044d2c8ac58f566a/0_135_3211_1927/master/3211.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0eab2e16011011a41ddfddb3d5d77665","title":"bayern munich real madrid champions league semi final first leg","story":"“The Champions League releases special powers in Real Madrid,” Toni Kroos had warned and there may be no power greater than the ability to survive, to always emerge, bruised perhaps but never beaten.

As they left, exhausted, Bayern Munich’s players struggled to grasp what had happened, defeated by their great rivals for a sixth successive game.What had happened was this: goals from Marcelo and Marco Asensio overturned Joshua Kimmich’s opener to give Real Madrid a 2-1 away victory. Mistakes defined this game as much as talent did, and Bayern made more of them. They started the night attacking and they ended it attacking too, but Madrid are a club who consider this competition their own, aware that there is always a chance. And there always is.Bayern’s first chance came after only 25 seconds, when the ball sat up for Robert Lewandowski. What came next was hit too hard to be a pass and too horizontal to be a shot. The tone, though, appeared to be set.It didn’t last, and nor did Arjen Robben. Forced off after just eight minutes, his departure did not just mean a change of personnel, but a change of shape. There was more misfortune for Bayern when Jérôme Boateng had to make way, too. And yet Bayern enjoyed much of the ball in those opening minutes and by then they had taken the lead.James Rodríguez’s ball sent Joshua Kimmich racing away up the right, and into the area. Lewandowski ran with him, Madrid’s centre-backs after him and their goalkeeper perhaps preoccupied with him because as Kimmich slowed slightly, Keylor Navas seemed to edge towards the centre. Instead of crossing, Kimmich hit the ball hard from a tight angle sending it flying past Navas in at the near post. Bayern had the lead and very nearly doubled it immediately, a swift robbery sending Lewandowski dashing clean through straight from the kick-off, only for Raphäel Varane to step across him.Franck Ribéry should have doubled it soon after, when Thiago Alcántara gave him the ball, alone inside the area only for his second touch to be astonishingly bad, barely able to believe it as the ball slipped away from him. And yet, despite the lead, there was still a sense that Bayern were not entirely comfortable here. That said, nor were Madrid in what was a game of surprising imprecision for two such talented teams. When Madrid had the ball, they created little, although Cristiano Ronaldo headed one wide.Mats Hummels’s touch was almost as bad as Ribéry’s had been a few minutes before, as he nearly gifted a chance to Luka Modric and then booted a simple pass straight out of play. Then he thumped a free-kick all the way through to Navas, born it seemed of a lack of ideas about what to do with it. Soon after, he was involved again, volleying over from seven yards.Despite the imprecision, chances came and the greater nerves were those of Madrid. Kimmich and Ribéry made a chance for Thomas Müller, running in, to hit on the bounce, only for Sergio Ramos to block a shot that was goalbound. Then, five minutes from a half-time whistle they were willing the referee to blow, Madrid scored. Ramos’s diagonal ball across was headed back by Dani Carvajal and Ronaldo leapt, seeking an overhead kick. He made no contact but he did put off Javi Martínez, who backed away, letting the ball bounce, and Marcelo struck a superb shot into the corner from 20 yards. How things change.When the clock reached 45 minutes the sensations were different, although they could have shifted again. Bayern had three chances in additional time at the end of the first half. Rodríguez’s free-kick, curled long into the area, found Lewandowski leaping seven yards out, but while he kept the header down he could not guide it towards either corner, the ball going straight at Navas. Next, Ribéry ran beyond Carvajal, clipping his cross to the far post. With Müller running in, Marcelo intercepted to head away. From the corner, Lewandowski was there again. His header just evaded Müller on he post. As he fell, the Pole complained that he had been held.The score was good now for Madrid but the performance was still a cause for concern and Zinedine Zidane replaced Isco with Marco Asensio. Ten minutes later, he had given them the lead, scoring a hugely significant goal. It came from a corner – for Bayern. Lewandowski nodded the ball down inside the six-yard box, but no one was there and it was cleared. The ball came out to Rafinha on the halfway line whose dreadful pass was intercepted by Asensio, who slotted it into Lucas Vázquez, two against one now, running into an enourmous space, Sven Ulreich at their mercy. Vázquez gave it back and Asensio finished superbly.Bayern could barely believe it. Ribéry, relentlessly running at Carvajal until the full-back was forced to withdraw injured, led Bayern’s bid to turn this round. In the absence of Robben, it was up to him.Twice he drew saves from Navas, before Müller and Lewandowski got in each other’s way as the ball dropped a metre from the line. Ronaldo had the ball in the net but it was ruled out because he had controlled with an arm.Still Bayern searched, but there was no way through, Madrid waiting, resisting, every ball into the box sent sailing out again. With three minutes to go, Lewandowski was free in the area, the ball slipped through to him, but he clipped his shot wide. The flag was up, anyway. So, too, was time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b044242ca09d89c983d6f0278cbe05c7627cc8/0_0_2265_1359/master/2265.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=069cf8ba9a9105d3538d79ae6be04b72","title":"jorge mendes wolves efl comply","story":"The EFL has announced that it is satisfied with the status of the Portuguese agent Jorge Mendes at Wolverhampton Wanderers, following concerns raised by Leeds United and other Championship clubs.The EFL said Mendes’s involvement – as an agent and as an adviser to the club and to its owner, the Chinese conglomerate Fosun – does not amount to a formal role. Because Mendes is not a director nor formally representing Fosun or controlling Wolves’ dealings the EFL concluded, following “a comprehensive review of the detail” Wolves supplied, that he did not have to be cleared under its owners and directors test, formerly known as the “fit and proper person test”.Now promoted from the Championship, Wolves’ ownership structures and relationship with Mendes will be scrutinised further by the Premier League, whose executive chairman, Richard Scudamore, is understood to have been asked by at least one club to bear in mind the concerns raised in the Championship.The Leeds owner, Andrea Radrizzani, tweeted last month that the Wolves ownership arrangements were “not legal and fair” because Fosun also owns a stake in Mendes’s agency Gestifute. Radrizzani then wrote to the Football Association, EFL and Premier League seeking clarification of the relationship with Mendes.The EFL statement in response deals with only part of the clarification sought. FA rules prohibit a company or person who owns a club to also own a stake in an agency Wolves’ arrangements are thought to pass because the stake in Gestifute is not directly held by Fosun but by a company owned by its chairman, Guo Guangchang.The FA’s rules aimed at preventing conflicts of interest also forbid an agent from being in a position to exercise any material, managerial or “any other influence over the affairs of a club” whether directly or indirectly.Wolves’ managing director, Laurie Dalrymple, confirmed last week that Mendes advises the club’s owner, has given advice on players – the manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, is a longstanding Mendes client - and that players “connected” to Mendes have been signed. Dalrymple maintained that no rules have been broken. The FA has not commented."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e056fc90a8457246b02b108d12467ede1431adb/0_162_4052_2431/master/4052.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdc37beb7dbd7ab076aaf7cd1b8494e2","title":"mohamed salah ronaldo messi ballon dor liverpool","story":"• Liverpool team-mates praise striker as one of the world’s top three• ‘Mo is becoming a superstar … it looks easy what he does’Mohamed Salah has already shot past Kevin De Bruyne to take the first inidual award of the domestic season now bookmakers are starting to wake up to the possibility of Liverpool’s goal machine breaking the Lionel Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo duopoly in the Ballon d’Or at the end of the year.The Egyptian has 43 goals in 47 clubs games this season, which is incredible enough, and thanks in no small part to his contribution against Roma his club are favourites to reach the Champions League final. If Salah can keep up his goalscoring and his knack of influencing the outcome of important matches he will certainly be a contender, and his Anfield team‑mates are backing him all the way.“Mo is becoming a superstar,” Dejan Lovren said after Salah’s performance against Roma. “It looks easy what he does, but it is very difficult. I don’t want to put any extra pressure on him and maybe this is not the right time but if he continues like that he has every right to be regarded as one of the best three in the world at the end of the year.“When people talk about Ronaldo and Messi they should also talk about Salah. He deserves it, he deserves to be mentioned for the Ballon d’Or. At the start of the season I didn’t know he could do this, but you see how he is working, how he wants the ball, he is just a different player to what he was.“I think our style helps him a lot. He didn’t play that way for Basel or Chelsea or Roma, but the way we can find him suits him perfectly. The most important thing now is for him to stay injury free. If he can do that, anything is possible.”Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose improvised pass sent Salah on his way to set up Liverpool’s third goal, agrees it is easy to play with someone who not only finds space but knows how to use it. “You know he is quick, you know he is smart and really intelligent, so I think we all know our game-plan,” the teenage full-back said. “We know if we hit it into the channels there will be a runner on the end of it and more often than not it is Mo on the right.“He’ll get on the end of it and usually manage to make something happen, which is a credit to him. There is still a long way to go to the Ballon d’Or ceremony, so he has another six months or so to carry on, but I think the team would back him to continue doing well.”The only downside as far as Alexander-Arnold is concerned is having to face such a tricky player in training. “It’s a nightmare when you are up against him,” he said. “It’s great to watch him scoring his goals and growing in confidence, he produces cool finishes day in and day out and it’s become second nature to him now, but I can’t say I really like it when he does that stuff to me.“The good thing about the second leg in Rome is that Mo is on our side not theirs. It’s much better to be playing with him rather than against him, and though Roma showed they are a threat in scoring their two goals, they know that we carry a goal threat as well. Maybe in the last 15 minutes of the first leg we lost our concentration, a little bit. I think we will all learn from that, but you don’t expect to be five goals up in a Champions League semi-final. It was hard not to get carried away with the atmosphere and the scoreline at the time, but we know what we need to do now. We have to go to Rome and finish the job.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb8a9370d80af599fb0d73d0640715d47bbc3f53/0_30_2636_1582/master/2636.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53d9d594e6150d8e5f6bb3d6fdb56ca9","title":"james milner liverpool in vogue barney ronay","story":"Sometimes the cock crows at midnight, the cats bark a dawn chorus and the cow does indeed jump over the moon. Just as every now and then a football statistic crops up that goes against every prevailing metric and trend, which seems not so much an anomaly as a case of football simply kicking off its shoes and enjoying itself.Only the stoniest heart could fail to be cheered a little by the news that James Milner is now out there alone as the most incisive creative player over the course of a single season in Champions League history.Not only has Milner contributed more goalscoring assists than Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi. He has done it having played fewer minutes than all of them, and while shouldering close to zero creative expectation, performing in effect as a defensive midfielder and occasional full-back.As Roma wobbled and reeled like a boxer punched out of shape in the second half at Anfield on Tuesday night, Milner’s right-wing corner was headed in by Roberto Firmino to take his own total to a record nine assists this season in world football’s premier club competition. This probably should not be happening. Milner himself was moved to tweet a typically wry response to Uefa’s celebration of this achievement, in the process sub-referencing and also contradicting his own Boring Milner persona (do keep up).And yet there it is all the same, tribute to Milner’s underrated precision at set pieces, his fine, accurate crosses with both feet, and indeed to Liverpool’s own strikingly well-drilled team dynamic. All this with a second leg in Rome and quite possibly a final in Kiev to come. For Milner these are some hard-earned, late-breaking high notes to a career spent close to, but often a little in the shadows of, the main stage.Milner does not start every week for Liverpool. He probably would not have played on Tuesday night if Emre Can were fit. But he is now unavoidably central to Jürgen Klopp’s plan for the remainder of the season following the trauma of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s knee injury in the first half at Anfield.As things stand Liverpool will face Roma, Chelsea and quite possibly Real Madrid or Bayern Munich with only Jordan Henderson, Gigi Wijnaldum and – yes – Europe’s deadliest provider of assists to fill the central midfield.Not that this should be a concern judging by Tuesday night. Milner’s performance against a team who had beaten Barcelona last time out was good enough to earn him a 7.5\u0026nbsprating from the notoriously sniffy Gazzetta dello Sport, below only Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino. And yet there is still an element of double-take to Milner’s presence as a key part of the finest attacking display at this stage of the Champions League since Bayern’s World Cup winners-in-waiting walked through Barcelona’s era-defining club team five years ago.Perhaps the most intriguing part of the current Milner Supremacy is that there are no obvious changes to his game. This is not an act of alchemy, the dramatic discovery of some hidden superpower by Professor Klopp, wheeling himself in through the conservatory doors, cranium throbbing. At Anfield Milner was simply himself once again, a footballer without a turn of pace, with no eye-catching technical skills, or obvious extreme qualities beyond the vital ones of intelligence, stamina and versatility.As Liverpool wrestled with Roma’s power and craft in the opening 20 minutes Milner was diligent and compact. As Liverpool surged into that annihilating Red Zone midway through the half Milner was diligent and compact. As Roma scored two late goals Milner was still diligent and compact, not to mention a little unlucky to concede a late penalty.He remains Milner the mule, an endearingly dogged, biddable figure, approaching each box-to-box shift like a plucky Soviet tractor steadily ploughing its way to the horizon and back again. Alongside the more deep-lying version of Henderson he provides a vital element of stillness at the heart of this attacking whirl of a team. Milner knows where to stand, where to cover, is free of the kind of creative ego that might lead him galloping into the wrong part of the pitch.His success points to the best part of Liverpool’s fine run, to the primacy of team and system that has so many players in this XI performing to their maximum capacity in bespoke, and perhaps untransferable tactical roles. Just as Roberto Firmino is the perfect Klopp centre‑forward, with no need to measure him against others doing other jobs in other teams, so the presence of Milner-Henderson at the peak of European club football points to the importance of balance over starrier qualities.In isolation Henderson+Milner might look a pretty ordinary collection of footballing attributes. But just as Klopp has talked about needing everyone to push the train, the players just component parts, so Milner and Henderson are the perfect piston engine behind the whistles and sparks and steam of that eye-catching attack. This is probably the best explanation for those assist stats too, a sign not of inidual brilliance but of a functioning and indeed highly specialised team. Milner’s job in that midfield three is to close the space, to get the ball and to give it to the people who score the goals, something he has done with great efficiency.Should Liverpool make it to Kiev no doubt some will suggest Milner might be tempted from international retirement, that a midfield two that can perform at such a level might just be England’s best bet in Russia. This would be to misunderstand the best parts of Milner’s success in the Champions League. Were England looking to replicate the Liverpool style, to play fast-pressing shock‑metal football then it might well be an ideal fit. But England play slowly under Gareth Southgate. This is lounge-jazz football, a carefully geared soft-metal style that requires if anything a little acceleration in midfield.Instead the lessons of late Milner are the primacy of the system, the value of versatility and those hard‑won game-management skills. And beyond that of a player who, like a footballing version of late‑career Johnny Cash, is fashionable once again simply by walking at the same speed, doing the same things, waiting for the right team, the right moment to take shape around him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4f209fa2d3981a3fcbb3ba0d6cab769c49aa6db/97_28_3899_2339/master/3899.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2218e8d3dd676159aa487f2efa1121bc","title":"bayern munich v real madrid champions league semi final first leg live","story":"In a game low on quality and inexplicably high on slapstick, Real Madrid emerged victorious ... to nobody’s great surpriseSid Lowe was our man typing his fingers to the bone in the Allianz Arena press box and has sent this on-the-whistle report for your reading pleasure. Tune into the ’s Football Weekly podcast tomorrow for more discussion on both this week’s Champions League semi-final first legs and a look ahead at the weekend’s Premier League action.If you’re not already a subscriber to Football Weekly, where have you been for the past 11 years? Here’s Monday’s episode for a taster, which features a tense row between myself and Barney Ronay ... in which he was wrong about everything. From Øyvind Røed: “Norwegian TV just showed something interesting for the 1-0 goal,” he writes. “Marcelo was nowhere to be seen because he was busy collecting the ball after it ran out for a Bayern goal kick. The Bayern ball boys were faster and by the time Marcelo returned to the pitch the ball was already in midfield.” Tyroleon hats off to the Bayern ball boys for their quick thinking in that case. A quite night from Cristiano Ronaldo: Apart from one early decoy run, Real’s star player contributed little or nothing tonight. He had one wild shot early in the second half which threatened to take out a corner flag, then moaned when he was correctly penalised for handball after controlling a pass from deep with his arm when he looked clear through on goal. At the final whistle, six or seven fans ran onto the pitch, with one of them making a beeline for Franck Ribery. I’m not sure if he was after a souvenir jersey, or wished to verbally or physically assault the Bayern winger. whatever it was, we’ll never know because the invader was tackled by several stewards before he reached his target. To be fair, along with Joshua Kimmich and James Rodriguez, Ribery was one of very few Bayern Munich players to emerge from tonight’s debacle with any credit.Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It’s all over at the Allianz Arena, where Real have won their sixth consecutive game against Bayern Munich. They take two away goals home to the Bernabeu, where Bayern Munich will need to score at least two goals to beat them. Stay tuned for post-match reaction and the great Sid Lowe’s on-the-whistle match report. I’ll be intrigued to see what he made of a match that was astonishingly low on quality, but none the poorer for all that.90+4 min: Ribery attempts to drill a low cross towards Thomas Muller in the Real penalty area, but Navas gets down to intercept. 90+3 min: Arjen Robben?!?!?! Apologies - he left the field after seven or eight minutes. It was Franck Ribery. 90+1 min: We’re into the first of four minutes of added time and Bayern Munich are on the attack. It breaks down when Arjen Robben dawdles on the ball and Real Madrid win possession back and gallop off on the counter.89 min: Kovacic drives forward with the ball at his feet and is brought down by Thiago, who takes a yellow card for the team. 88min: Robert Lewandowski, who may well be a Real Madrid player next season, sends the kind of finish you’d expect him to slot home with his eyes closed wide after being put through on goal by a great Corento Tolisso through ball.85 min: Ribery lofts a cross into the Real Madrid penalty area and instead of heading it clear, Marcelo opts to larrup the ball straight up into the air. This is comically inept stuff - like everyone involved has had a few pints, or collectively got together before the game and agreed to wear their boots on the wrong feet ... just for a laugh.83 min: Real Madrid make their final substitution: Casemiro off, Lucas Kovacic on. We won’t be seeing Gareth Bale in action tonight. 80 min: Just 10 minutes plus add-ons to go and Bayern are in dire need of at least one more goal to take to the Bernabeu. They win a corner when Vazquez chests a Ribery cross out of play. Nothing comes of it. 78 min: Casemiro is booked for a late tackle on James Rodriguez, a minute or two after Benzema had forced a save from Ulreich from close range. Now Benzema is limping - it’s beginning to resemble a battle scene from Game of Thrones out there. 76 min: Bayern Munich make their third substitution of the night. Javi Martinez makes way nursing a head injury and looking very dazed and confused, box-to-box midfielder Corentin Tolisso replaces him. 74 min: I should clarify that since coming on for Dani Carvajal, Karim Benzema has not gone in at right-back with the onerous job of shackling Franck Ribery. Lucas Vasquez has been given that plum gig. 72 min: Cristiano Ronaldo controls a ball from deep with his arm on the edge of the Bayern penalty area and is penalised for hand-ball when clean through on goal. Looking highly indignant and on the verge of tears, he claims the ball hit his shoulder. Replays prove it so didn’t. 70 min: Misplaced passes, slapstick defending, goalmouth scrambles, out-of-form strikers on for injured full-backs, wild shots hitting corner flags ... this is more like a Sunday League match than a Champions League semi-final between two of the best teams in Europe. It’s good fun, mind.69 min: Thomas Muller and Robert Lewandowski as they attempt to scramble home the ball from a few yards out after a James ball from deep is headed across the face of goal. Bayern appeal for a penalty, claiming Sergio Ramos handled it, but the referee is not interested. 66 min: Despite the Real physios making it clear that Dani Carvajal will have to go off injured, no substitution is made and he remains on the field as Bayern attack. Zidane instructs him to hit the deck. He does so and next time the ball goes out of play he makes way for Karim Benzema. 61 min: There’s a break in play as Dani Carvajal goes down with what looks like a hamstring injury. It’s been an intriguing match, with no shortage of talking points, but the standard of football has been appalling considering this is the first leg of a Champions League semi-final featuring European royalty.60 min: Franck Ribery finds himself with the ball at his feet and a clear sight of goal from about 15 yards. He shoots, but Navas saves well with a strong hand at his near post. 58 min: For reasons best known to himself after Real had cleared a Bayern corner, Rafinha attempted to square the ball across to Kimmich just inside his own half. It’s woefully misplaced and Lucas Vazquez pounces. He plays the ball to Asensio, who gallops into acres of space and clips the ball over the advancing Ulreich. It rolls with laser-like precision into the bottom right hand corner.A calamitous error from Rafinha leads to a Real counter-attack that ends with Marco Asensio clipping the ball over Sven Ulreich and into the bottom corner. 55 min: Thomas Muller curls a delivery across the face of goal from deep, attempting to pick out Lewandowski. He does so, but the ball’s a mite too high and Lewandowski is left with no choice but to head downwards. There’s nobody on hand to slot home. 53 min: Franck Ribery is booked for leaving one in on Raphael Varane as the pair contested the ball in midfield. 52 min: A Ribery pull-back from the byline looks likely to tee up Muller in a thicket of Real players six yards from goal, but Raphael Varane gets a vital touch to deflect the ball off his toe. 49 min: Bayern get forward with Franck Ribery and Robert Lewandowski combing through the centre. They run down a blind alley, the ball’s played wide and back into the centre, where Marcelo heads clear as Navas flaps wildly in the background. 47 min: Cristiano Ronaldo attempts his first shot of the night and puts the ball out for a throw-in near the corner flag. 46 min: Real Madrid get the second half started with Marco Asensio on for Isco. One suspects Bayern are going to need another goal or two to give themselves a chance of progressing to the final, while Real seemed happy enough to try to contain them in the first half. That’s unlikely to change now that they’ve got an away goal under their belt. It’s all square at the Allianz Arena, where a scrappy, dull first half sparked into life when Joshua Kimmich took advantage of some sloppy goalkeeping to fire Bayern into the lead near the half-hour mark. With Bayern in complete control, despite losing Arjen Robben and then Jerome Boateng to injury, Real Madrid looked to be in total disarray. But with half-time looming, Marcelo popped up to equalise with a fine volleyed finish that has left Bayern on the back foot. Cristiano Ronaldo, in case you’re wondering, has been anonymous.45+2 min: Marcelo heads the ball out for a Bayern corner, towards the end of what’s been a very strange half. The delivery comes in, Thomas Muller gets a touch and looks to have sent the ball flashing past Navas, but it’s just wide. 45 min: Lucas Vazquez fouls Ribery about 30 yards from the Real goal, left of centre. Thiago and James stand over the ball. James curls the ball across the face of goal, but Lewandowski heads straight at Keylor Navas, who scrambles the ball clear. How did he miss?Marcelo equalises and it’s totally against the run of play. He volleys low and hard into the bottom right-hand corner from 20 yards, converting a header across the box from Dani Carvajal. 43 min: With Real Madrid’s defence in an absolute shambles, Thomas Muller volleys wide after getting a good connection on a cross from Rafinha. His effort takes a big deflection off Raphael Varane and goes out for a corner from which nothing comes. 41 min: From a corner, Mats Hummels volleys high over the bar from six yards after getting on the end of a Robert Lewandowski flick-on. He should have done better. 38 min: Every member of Munich’s canine community Munich pricks their ears as a ridiculously loud chorus of shrill whistling reverberates around the stands after Dani Carvejal bodychecks Joshua Kimmich, is penalised and then spends the best part of a minute protesting his innocence to the referee. He somehow avoids a booking and the whistles become even more shrill. 37 min: While Jerome Boateng was able to gingerly make his way down the stairs to the tunnel unassisted, he does not by any stretch of the imagination look like a man who’ll be fit for the second leg of this match in six days time. 32 min: Moments after Real restarted the game, Bayern went on the attack again and had a penalty appeal turned down. Lewandowski was muscled off the ball by Raphael Varane when through on goal.

If you’re looking for nuance in the kitchen, this is not for you. But\u0026nbspif you are time-poor, appliance-shy or incompetent,\u0026nbspthen it is. It is so straightforward to make, so utterly bake-by-numbers, I half-expected to find it came with a sachet of enzymes to help you digest the thing. Alas not.Dr Oetker launched its baking kits late last year with little fanfare. The German-owned food company’s UK branch is based on an industrial estate in Lancashire opposite Crossleys, a company that repairs caravans – another sort of box. Yet Dr Oetker has become one of the leading manufacturers of frozen foods and baking equipment. It dominates the market. Put simply, the bake in the box cake is evolution.I get my hands on the lemon and poppy seed loaf (other varieties include banana and choc chip, and double chocolate). To make it, you remove the lid and empty the mix into the box. Whisk seven tablespoons of milk in using a fork (since we’re on a convenience tip, I use the same tablespoon) and pop into an oven, preheated to 190Cgas mark 5. Remove after 10 minutes, score a 1cm-deep groove down the middle of the cake and return to the oven for a further 20\u0026nbspminutes.This is convenience food from the same school as boil in the bag and microwave meals: all designed to help “overcome the barriers consumers face when it comes to home baking”, says the company. It’s a valid argument, although there’s something conflicting about the almost tyrannical convenience and the fact that it still takes 30 minutes to bake. But it works, and the cake is fine: lemony, dense, too sweet but adequate.The good news is that Dr Oetker didn’t try to gender it with a pink box, or deploy a fun font to make it look hip. The bad news – and I discovered this after eating the cake\u0026nbsp– is that Dr Oetker has a Nazi past. Richard Kaselowsky, a past owner of the firm, was a “leading supporter” of Hitler. The company’s president at that time – and son of the original doctor – Rudolf-August Oetker joined the Nazi party in the 1930s, news that was later exposed by his son, August Oetker – to his credit – because, according to a spokesman: “The business felt it important to be transparent about any mistakes that were made in the past, set the facts straight once and for all and do everything to prevent anything like the Third Reich happening again.” So\u0026nbspthere you go.But back to the cake. Dr Oetker’s Bake in the Box is ridiculously simple to make – it would take a colossal muppet to mess it up and yet, I did. Halfway through, I\u0026nbspdecided to add lemon juice to zhoosh it up – but in my attempt to rip up the rulebook, as it were, I\u0026nbspended up ripping the box.

Send us your thoughts and responsesOur community of 70 families is facing being made homeless by our landlord, who wants to knock down our estate to build executive-style houses to sell for profit. They are rare houses of a specific construction – built by the National Coal Board in the 1950s – and can be modernised without being knocked down. We have organised a lot around this application. We’ve put signs up with our “Save our homes” logo and have a banner prominently displayed. We have residents’ meetings, a regular newsletter updating residents, a website and a change.org petition, as well as a Facebook account and are hoping to have a local demo in May. We have even organised a bat survey on the building to see whether any bats shelter in the property – which protects a building from being demolished, as a last resort. We feel our landlord is making contradictory statements about whether we will get to keep our tenancies. In some cases they say they won’t be able to decide on the tenure of the new homes until they have planning permission, but at other points they have said it is unlikely we will be forced out or that we would be made to leave at all. This is confusing, as the planning application – to bulldoze over where we live and replace it with new houses – has always stayed the same. Our campaign has had some success so far. There are lots of objections on the planning site, not just from our estate but from friends and family outside, and others who have heard about our campaign. Due to the large number of objections the decision will go before a panel where we will get the chance to have our say, probably in June. But amid all this campaigning, we are fearful it may amount to nothing. While many of us on the estate are low-income families, we are all private tenants, and feel it is harder to get the same national attention and outrage that is received when social housing is being demolished. How can we protect our homes and stop the demolition of these rare, truly affordable homes that are so vital to our sense of community, home, and the right to be housed for low-income groups in Leeds?What an impressive campaign, and what a sad situation. A local demo will be a good way to broaden your appeal. Think about holding it earlier – with local elections coming, you can show politicians you are serious, and that local people care about this campaign.Look through Leeds council’s local plan, and check whether this development disagrees with its aims in any areas, be it around affordable housing, the environment, or conservation – this is important for the panel. Refurbishment is generally a greener option than demolition, and that should play a strong role in the council’s considerations. And think about other possible interest groups you can bring in, like ex-mining communities that care about the legacy of these properties.I spoke to successful housing campaigners for you. Glyn Harries, from the New Era campaign says to start thinking about direct action. Decide for yourselves: what happens if push comes to shove? What are you willing to do? And are there concrete actions you can start developing now? Make it clear that you are willing to take non-violent direct action. One simple thing, is deciding to make a clear statement on whether you plan to leave your homes. Dr Stuart Hodgkinson from Leeds University says: “They might be private renters with fewer rights, but if all 70 say they have no plans to leave, it will be a big financial operation to evict them all.”Consider your options: could you create a non-profit organisation and seek to buy the homes yourself, with fundraising? If you don’t want the homes to be demolished, you should also get expert advice. Find out what all the costs will be – of eviction, redevelopment, or potential homelessness – so you can make people aware of what costs the private developer may be avoiding, and who will end up paying for it – for example, in their tax bill. And look at the cost of alternatives, like bringing these homes up to a decent standard instead of demolition.Look into the developer too: find out what other companies it has links with, look into its accounts at companies house, see what other developments it owns, and talk to residents from those homes to see how they live – all these things will help you to know what you’re up against, and just what kind of company it is.You have a lot of friends out there – activists who have won successful campaigns, like New Era and Sweets Way have offered their contacts, and the Butterfield estate could have good advice. Let me know if you want more details. Generation Rent has agreed to put you in touch with iniduals where you are. Hodgkinson has asked me to pass on his number.Finally, say Harries and Hodgkinson, celebrity doesn’t hurt. You’re a well-oiled machine, but if you had a well-known Yorkshireperson backing your cause, it would bring huge public attention. Think about who that might be.• What do you think?

As Ian Young, who lives with PTSD, has competed in the Invictus Games and is also a run director for parkrun in County Durham, says: “There is a huge sense of belonging and achievement and both Strava and parkrun are a great way to meet up to run, socialise and make new friends – providing me with a great support network.”A 2017 survey showed that GPs, nurses and physiotherapists now even “prescribe” parkrun to their patients. Paul Sinton-Hewitt, who created parkrun in 2004, has said: “Belonging to such social and supportive networks, which show the joy that regular physical activity brings, can be a significant catalyst for it becoming a lifelong habit”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa1522acd40110e31f4b2d145f09e431f05ceabd/0_0_3146_2112/master/3146.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c31fd776d74712be32cefb341d59edcf 1760w","title":"heidi alexander thought to be considering role at london city hall","story":"Labour MP quit as shadow health secretary in 2016 in protest at Jeremy Corbyn’s leadershipHeidi Alexander, the former shadow health secretary, is considering quitting the Commons to accept a senior job at City Hall with London mayor Sadiq Khan, the  understands.Alexander was Khan’s campaign chair during the 2016 London mayoral election.

Khan’s spokesman declined to comment.Alexander has been the co-chair, with Alison McGovern, of the Labour campaign for the single market, aimed at shifting the party leadership’s position on the issue. Alexander, who was elected in 2010, was previously full time deputy mayor for Lewisham, overseeing regeneration schemes. However, since quitting the shadow cabinet in protest at Corbyn’s leadership in July 2016, Alexander has come under pressure from pro-Corbyn campaign group Momentum, including some local activists who are also members of the far left Alliance for Workers’ Liberty.The influx of new members has sometimes represented a direct challenge, with local members vocally objecting to her decision to quit the shadow cabinet. Momentum’s position is stronger in the neighbouring constituency of Lewisham Deptford however, the campaign group last week launched a Lewisham East left caucus, to “help comrades build a strong left in the remaining stronghold of the Labour right in Lewisham”. Should Alexander quit the Commons in order to take up the role, there is likely to be a fierce battle for her south London seat, which was retained at the last election with a majority of more than 21,000.If Alexander is appointed by Khan, he would gain an experienced and popular Labour ally, bolstering his links with the parliamentary party ahead of his re-selection later this summer.

Richards, selected as the party’s candidate for Worcester last week, had claimed on her Twitter account there were “no images … of physical damage” from the bombing last May, and also said there was a “convenient shortage of evidence” in the murder of the MP Jo Cox.A panel from Labour’s national executive committee – including Unite union’s national officer, Jim Kennedy, the GMB union’s national political officer, Cath Speight, and the Islington councillor Claudia Webbe – called Richards to an emergency meeting to explain herself, the  understands. The decision has been taken not to endorse her candidacy.The NEC has the power to remove a candidate if he or she has concealed anything that might be likely to bring the party into disrepute. Richards allegedly did not fill in the form correctly, nor did the selection committee question her about her social media history.Richards has been placed under civil restraint by the high court, preventing her from bringing any legal action without judicial approval.She is reported to have made “false and vexatious claims” against MI5 and MI6 and a long list of others, including her GP and Thames Water. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, was called to give evidence against her at the high court, where she said Richards was an “obsessive” whose claims “cannot be true”.Questions are likely to be asked about how Richards passed the selection process, having previously been shortlisted for another target seat in Telford several weeks earlier.Applicants are explicitly asked in the application form and by the interview panel to disclose anything in their background, personal, political or financial, past or present, which could have any potential to embarrass either themselves or the party. Richards was told by the panel she had broken the rules when she did not disclose any information in response to that question in the application form or interview. The panel decided that was a “lack of judgment that is not compatible with the high standards the party expect of candidates and elected representatives”.Richards has said she is a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, but sources at Momentum, the grassroots leftwing movement, have insisted it does not back her, and said they did not back any candidate in the seat, which has a 2,500 Conservative majority.A source close to the NEC said the committee had decided to take swift action. “The panel is people from right across the political spectrum,” the source said.Kennedy and Webbe are key allies of Corbyn on the committee. “This is not a factional decision but a unanimous one that no one else on the NEC would block,” the source said. “There will be plenty of others now who want to contest that seat.”On Tuesday night, members of the local Worcester party’s committee met to discuss the selection, agreeing to back the NEC’s decision.Speaking after the decision, Richards said she was disappointed but understood the NEC’s decision, which was the result of “adverse publicity” over the past few days.“It has not however dampened my resolve or passion for politics,” she said. “It is unfortunate that the misrepresentation of the circumstances leading up to my selection were allowed to gain traction.”Richards said she had not stated that the Manchester attack and Cox’s death were staged, despite tweets questioning both events. “I would never seek to offend the victims and the bereaved in these incidents, that would be entirely contrary to my motivation,” she said. She hinted that those who had opposed her candidacy were politically motivated, saying that iniduals had “unfairly seized on an opportunity to distort my intention to further their own ambition at the expense of mine … they will need to wrestle with their consciences on that in due course. The conceit, however, will not remain unanswered.”Richards said she wanted to apologise to the people of Worcester. “Your standing ovation at the hustings meeting has left be with the most heartwarming memory of my brief time with you,” she said. “I hope you find another formidable women to take up the mantle for we are aplenty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25548b5b49886f78df87ce8fb40bf31ebced6bf0/0_105_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38515e40319ccdad03c917a0195c5af8","title":"labour mps march with jewish colleague to party hearing ruth smeeth","story":"Corbyn ally Len McCluskey says MPs are damaging the Labour party and its leaderThe general secretary of the Unite trade union, Len McCluskey, has accused Labour MPs who have complained about antisemitism of “smearing” Jeremy Corbyn, and called for them to be “held to account”.In an article in the New Statesman, McCluskey, who is a close ally of Corbyn and his team, says: “I look with disgust at the behaviour of the Corbyn-hater MPs who join forces with the most reactionary elements of the media establishment and I understand why there is a growing demand for mandatory reselection.”Unite was the largest single donor to Labour’s 2017 general election campaign and the party’s new general secretary, Jennie Formby, was previously a senior officer at the union.McCluskey denounces some Labour MPs by name, including “Chris Leslie, Neil Coyle (my own MP), John Woodcock, Wes Streeting, Ian Austin and others”, calling them “a dismal chorus whose every dirge makes winning a Labour government more difficult”, and accusing them of “working overtime trying to present the Labour party as a morass of misogyny, antisemitism and bullying”.He adds: “You would have to go back a long way to find such a sustained smearing by MPs of their own leader and their own party as we are seeing now.”And he warns that “promiscuous critics” who “wish to hold Corbyn to account can expect to be held to account themselves”.The mention of mandatory reselection will alarm some Labour MPs. Corbyn’s political secretary, Katy Clark, is currently carrying out a wide-reaching review of democracy in the party, which some fear could result in proposals that would make it easier for backbenchers critical of the leadership to be removed by their local parties. McCluskey says he is “personally not in favour” of mandatory reselection but “lost that argument overwhelmingly”.McCluskey’s pointed intervention came as Corbyn attempted to show he was getting to grips with the antisemitism row, after Jewish leaders expressed disappointment about the outcome of a meeting on Tuesday night.About 40 MPs marched with their colleague Ruth Smeeth to a party disciplinary hearing.The Labour leader’s spokesman said on Wednesday that Formby would make tackling antisemitism her top priority, and Corbyn would “lead the drive to eliminate antisemitism in the party”.He said there were currently 90 cases under investigation – with 18 waiting to go through the NCC (national constitutional committee) – Labour’s most senior disciplinary body. He added that over the last three years there had been 300 complaints and 20 people had been suspended in the last fortnight alone. understands the McCluskey article was not cleared with Corbyn’s office in advance.On Wednesday about 40 Labour MPs and peers marched in support of their Jewish colleague Ruth Smeeth before she gave evidence at an expulsion hearing against an activist accused of berating her at the launch of Labour’s antisemitism inquiry.MPs including the shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, the former shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith and the Jewish Labour movement chair, Luciana Berger, formed a protective ring around Smeeth as she entered the hearing in London.The Labour activist Marc Wadsworth will have his case heard by the NCC, which has the power to expel members. The hearing comes 22 months after the first complaint was made against Wadsworth, who challenged Smeeth at a the launch of Shami Chakrabati’s inquiry into antisemitism, accusing her of working “hand in hand” with the media.Labour Against the Witch-Hunt, a campaign group set up to protest against expulsions, turned out to support Wadsworth at the hearing in Westminster. Several people shouted: “Free Palestine,” as the MPs walked past.Berger said the MPs who had joined Smeeth were “looking for action” against antisemitism. “Warm words are nice, but in and of themselves they are not enough, and that’s why we’re here with our colleague Ruth Smeeth. She has an incredible amount of support,” she said.MPs said they had decided to support Smeeth because she had initially been told by the party she would be responsible for her own security walking to the hearing. Streeting, who organised the delegation to accompany Smeeth, said: “I was proud to see so many Labour MPs and peers from across the party – including shadow ministers – accompanying Ruth this morning in a show of friendship and solidarity. But no victim of abuse should ever have to walk through a protest against them to give evidence to a hearing. It is an appalling state of affairs.”Other MPs accompanying Smeeth included prominent backbenchers Stella Creasy, Jess Phillips, and Margaret Hodge, alongside Smeeth’s fellow Stoke-on-Trent MP Gareth Snell. Also there were Lord Dubs and the chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, Karen Pollock. Creasy said other MPs were likely to need similar support at future hearings. “No one should go through something like this in the movement they dedicate their lives to fighting for. Sadly, more MPs may be likely to need support in many more hearings like this in the coming months,” she said. Labour MP Chris Williamson, a former shadow cabinet minister, also attended the hearing as a witness supporting Wadsworth.Speaking outside the hearing, Wadsworth said he was not antisemitic and that he had endured “almost two years of trial by media”. He added that much of the reporting around his case had been incorrect. Asked whether he thought he would get a fair hearing, he said: “I reserve my view on that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4f423b6bcc385d89b640d7e5898587c79584308/203_198_6498_3899/master/6498.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7b7fd6ea24ae075dce4af3453a211b9","title":"may loses lords vote on post brexit powers for ministers","story":"Peers rip up ‘blank chequebook ministers that sought to give themselves’, inflicting heavy defeatPeers and MPs claimed a significant victory on Wednesday when an attempt to give sweeping powers to ministers was thrown out of the Brexit bill as complaints about the power of the Lords to reverse the decisions of the Commons grew louder.In the first of a series of votes on how the powers brought back from Brussels would be limited by the balance between ministers and parliament, peers from all parties defeated the government by 349 to 221 – a majority of 128.On Tuesday, the Tory backbencher and vociferous Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg accused peers of “playing with fire” over Brexit. A petition calling for a referendum on the abolition of the Lords has attracted more than 100,000 signatures and is eligible for a debate at Westminster.Amnesty International said the Lords had “ripped up the blank chequebook that ministers sought to give themselves. “The Lords have sent a clear message to the Commons: leaving the EU shouldn’t mean leaving rights behind.”The vote on Wednesday, which was one of the biggest majorities against the government so far, overturned an attempt to give ministers the power to decide to make changes to EU laws on the basis of what they “considered appropriate” rather than what was necessary.Critics, led by the crossbencher Lord Lisvane, argued that it was too low a bar to set for what may be very significant decisions. He dismissed a compromise offered by the government to include the phrase “good reason”.“The test for political decision-making is not simply whether there are good reasons. There may be good reasons for doing something and better reasons for not doing it,” Lisvane said.He said the EU withdrawal bill would be a precedent for other legislation resulting from Brexit. “Whichever side of the Brexit debate they stand, people might reasonably believe that taking back control would be under the sovereignty of parliament rather than ceding swaths of power to the executive.”Among other powers sought by the government but expected to be rejected by the Lords was the power to set up new agencies without an act of parliament, and the power to create new criminal offences. The government faces three more days of challenges to the bill, in particular over the row with Scotland over devolved powers, which the Scottish National party has refused to accept. As a result Holyrood could refuse to grant legislative consent, creating another standoff with Westminster.The Brexit minister Lord Callanan argued that the changes risked making the bill unworkable.

With good reason. Because the person the country might be relying on for that information could be him.Detail and Davis are barely on nodding terms. Partly because leaving the EU is a great deal more complicated than he expected, but mainly because he’s hopelessly out of his depth. Davis has yet to be asked any question, no matter how straightforward, that doesn’t take him completely by surprise.The Brexit secretary has also yet to attend a meeting for which he is fully prepared. At the start of his latest outing to update the Brexit select committee on his lack of progress, Davis spent the best part of 10 minutes explaining why he had to get away early as he had another meeting scheduled that he was already late for. As this was precisely the same excuse he had used at his last appearance, everyone on the committee was underwhelmed.“I’m very busy,” Davis explained. Busy being busy with busy things. And always at least one meeting behind himself.As it turned out, the committee had more than enough time to explore the depths of Davis’s knowledge. Largely because he knows so little. On almost every question the Brexit secretary’s stock answer is one of definite vagueness. A man with the utmost confidence in his own limitations.Hilary Benn, chair of the exiting the European union committee, began by asking how, having spent the past 22 months achieving next to nothing, the government could be sure of reaching an agreement on Ireland in the next couple of months. Because he could, Davis insisted. And if he couldn’t then something would probably be sorted out later.So it went on. There might or might not be a deal. Parliament might or might not be able to ask the government to renegotiate with the EU. He was making tremendous progress but was unable to list any achievements. He didn’t know if there would be time for the Office for Budget Responsibility to calculate the economic impacts of any deal but it didn’t matter anyway because he would be providing his own assessments, which might or might not exist.Normally, the Brexit enthusiasts on the committee can be relied on to come to Davis’s rescue by asking him simple questions and congratulating him profusely for his failure to answer. But even they are now beginning to look worried that his air of stupidity may not be an act. When Davis declared that the real benefit of leaving the customs union was “releasing Liam to sign trade deals”, several members ran out of the room sobbing. When the country’s future depends on Liam Fox, even the Brexiters know we’re screwed.The only upside for Davis was that he was too dim to realise just what a poor impression he had made. At prime minister’s questions, later in the morning, Theresa May had no such relief. Her tragedy is that she is self-aware enough to realise she’s not very good, but not so much that she can do anything about it. A kinder party than the Tories would put her out of her misery.With Jeremy Corbyn, practice may not make perfect but it does make him less mediocre. For the second week running he went in on Windrush and this time he made no mistake. May could only mumble in a dissociated trance. It wasn’t her fault. It was Labour’s. She was going to give people the citizenship rights they already had. It wasn’t her fault ...“Maybot,” shouted Emily Thornberry. May smiled wanly. Her self esteem is now so low she regards “Maybot” as a term of endearment.The prime minister ploughed on. She had only wanted to deport a few illegal immigrants. The Windrush generation had just been unfortunate collateral damage. No biggy. It was being sorted and everyone should stop making such a fuss. Tone deaf, tin ear.It was Yvette Cooper who delivered the coup de grâce. May should stop hiding behind Labour, the cabinet and civil servants. The buck stopped with her. It was her hostile environment policy that had caused the scandal. End of.“The government isn’t bereft of ideas,” May stammered, her eyes wide in desperation. The situation was far worse than that. Ideas were only the tip of the iceberg. Sans eyes, sans teeth, sans everything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4d6565930eccf9a9dda0576e50e0e110a535db5/0_138_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ad32fa38d8040fdc05d66ae4a96894a","title":"swedish archaeologists uncover brutal 5th century massacre","story":"A three-year dig has uncovered the shocking violence with which the inhabitants of the coastal village of Sandby Borg were struck downArchaeologists in Sweden have uncovered startling evidence of a massacre more than 1500 years ago, when the inhabitants of a small village were struck down in their houses or as they fled along the street, and their bodies left to rot where they fell – with their treasures including beautiful jewellery and Roman gold coins.At Sandby Borg on the shore of Öland island, off the south-east coast of Sweden, there was no escape. In one house an old man was smashed on the skull so that he fell into the fire in the open hearth, where his body was charred to the bone. In another a teenage boy, possibly trying to flee, tripped over a body lying on the floor, and died where he fell.Such an aura of horror clung to the site that when archaeologists went in to uncover the gruesome facts, local people warned them they should keep well away from the green mound within the low stone wall.After three seasons of excavation, with less than a tenth of the site excavated, the team which publishes its findings today in the journal Antiquity, believes they have uncovered evidence of a catastrophic end to the life of the village – “a single event that made time stop – like a shipwreck but on land”.In the mid 5th century Sandby Borg had been a prosperous village built within the walls of a ring fort. After the attack nobody ever came back either to bury the dead, to loot their precious possessions or to take their valuable livestock. The dead – nine in just one house – rotted where they fell, lying in their houses until the roofs decayed and collapsed in on them, or sprawled in the village street, and their animals starved to death in their pens.Scattered among treasures including Roman gold coins, silver gilt jewellery, silver hair ornaments, intricate glass beads and cowrie shells from the Mediterranean, the archaeologists even found scraps of the last meals, including half a herring still lying by a hearth, and cooking pots where they were last set down until crushed by the collapsing roof.Ludwig Papmehl-Dufay, an archaeologist from the team at the local museum, which began excavations after warnings that the site was being targeted by treasure hunters, said that while no written or oral history of the massacre survived, there were persistent stories that it was regarded locally as a dangerous place. “I do find it most likely that the event was remembered and that it triggered strong taboos connected to the site, possibly brought on through oral history for centuries.”The archaeologists hope to return to the site this summer, but after three seasons of excavation have uncovered enough mysteries to keep them busy through several winters. Stuffed into the skull of one man they found four sheep’s teeth. Papmehl-Dufay suggests that they may represent a final insult, the opposite to ancient beliefs of placing a coin or other small valuable with the dead to pay for passage to the afterworld, instead a contemptuous curse to prevent it. Nearby they found one bone from a tiny arm, the first evidence that children were not spared.Among all the covetable possessions found among the three houses excavated and the 26 bodies discovered, they found no weapons – they speculate that they may have been taken as trophies, and could still lie dumped as a ritual offering into a nearby bog.Öland is a low island off the Swedish coast in the Baltic Sea, and in the Roman period it was wealthy. The Roman gold coins, and the luxury imports found among the scattered corpses, may represent wages earned fighting as mercenaries. The island has rich archaeology including foundations of more than 1000 stone houses, thousands of cemeteries and graves, and at least 15 ringforts – of which only Sandby Borg seems to have come to such a gruesome end in the turbulent decades when the Western Roman Empire collapsed and local tribes vied for power. The Kalmar county museum has a small exhibition about the site, and hopes to create a larger permanent display on a story which even the archaeologists working on it found uniquely disturbing.

Calculations suggest that by the present day, hundreds more galaxies would have been swallowed up by the cluster, propelling it to a mass equivalent to 1,000 trillion suns, which would make it the largest known object in the universe.The observations reveal at least 14 galaxies packed into an area only four times the diameter of the Milky Way’s galactic disk. An adjoining blob of light that has not yet been resolved into inidual objects suggest that the total number of galaxies heading for a collision could be closer to 30.The light from the merger began travelling to us 1.4bn years after the big bang, when the universe was just a tenth of its current age.“Having caught a massive galaxy cluster in throes of formation is spectacular in and of itself,” said Scott Chapman, an astrophysicist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada and co-author. “But, the fact that this is happening so early in the history of the universe poses a formidable challenge to our present-day understanding of the way structures form in the universe,” he said.During the first few million years of cosmic history, normal matter and dark matter began to clump together, eventually giving rise to galaxy clusters. In the present day, these clusters may contain as many as a thousand galaxies, vast swathes of dark matter, immense black holes, and clouds of gas that reach temperatures of over a million degrees.Current theories suggest that clusters as massive as the one observed, known as SPT2349-56, should have taken about twice as long to evolve, however.“How this assembly of galaxies got so big so fast is a bit of a mystery, it wasn’t built up gradually over billions of years, as astronomers might expect,” said Tim Miller, a PhD student at Yale University and coauthor on the paper.Computer simulations of the galaxies predict that over time the cluster will have assembled into one of the most massive structures – perhaps the most massive known object – in the modern universe.“It would exceed anything we’ve seen in the local universe,” said Carlos De Breuck, an astronomer at the European Space Observatory.The 14 galaxies seen heading towards each other are known as starburst galaxies due to the vigorous star formation. In such galaxies, thousands of stars are born every year, compared to just one in our own Milky Way. The galaxies would have blazed bright and then burnt out quickly because they consume their gas at an extraordinary rate.The galaxy cluster was first spotted as a faint smudge of light, using the South Pole telescope and the Herschel space observatory. Astronomers then used the Atacama large millimetersubmillimeter Array (Alma), a telescope comprising 66 antennas spread over 16km in the Chilean Andes, to make more detailed observations. The findings are published in Nature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b24db08f348821413f09aa5af171e7a8b112fb3a/0_49_3252_1951/master/3252.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82fb725a1fbf88b0729c3a23b98f6e20","title":"iaaf testosterone rules caster semenya","story":"The Olympic 800m champion Caster Semenya could run up to seven seconds slower under new rules requiring her to lower her natural testosterone levels to race internationally, a prominent sports scientist has predicted.Under rules due to be announced on Thursday morning by the IAAF, the world athletics governing body, a separate female classification for an athlete with differences of sexual development (or DSDs) will be introduced. Such athletes, including Semenya, will have to reduce and then maintain their testosterone levels to no greater than 5nmolL by 1\u0026nbspNovember if they want to compete in events ranging from 400\u0026nbspmetres to a mile.The move, which is sure to ide opinion, was unanimously approved by the IAAF council last month. According to the world-renowned sports scientist Ross Tucker, the effect will be significant on athletes such as Semenya. “If this policy passes, then I would predict that Semenya will be five to seven seconds slower over 800\u0026nbspmetres,” he wrote.“The other really interesting thing is that, guided by the new IOC transgender policy that lowers the upper limit for testosterone to 5nmolL, the IAAF are setting their limit at 5nmolL. It used to be 10. That will slow the times of these athletes down even more than it did in the past.”He told the : “History suggests Semenya will lose about four seconds to five seconds. Because in 2013 and 2014, when the IAAF were diligent about ensuring her compliance with the upper limit at that time (10nM), she was running 2:00. I don’t think she even qualified for the Commonwealth Games. Now, at 5nM, that effect will be even larger, I suspect. She will go from a 1:54 to 2:01-2:03, is my estimate.”Semenya burst on to the scene in 2009 when she won the world 800m title but was then required to take testosterone-suppressing medicine by the IAAF in order to compete. However, in July 2015 the court of arbitration for sport reversed that rule when it examined the Dutee Chand case – allowing inter-sex athletes to compete without taking testosterone-suppressing medication.The decisive factor for the Cas panel in 2015 was whether testosterone above the 10nmolL threshold set by the IAAF gave female athletes a competitive advantage over their fellow competitors. However research by the IAAF since then shows that in certain events testosterone does make an enormous difference. An IAAF report notes that “most females have low levels of testosterone circulating naturally in their bodies (0.12 to 1.79 nmolL in blood) while after puberty the normal male range is much higher (7.7 – 29.4 nmolL). Absent a DSD or a tumour, no female would have serum levels of testosterone approaching 5 nmolL, but iniduals with DSDs can have very high levels of natural testosterone, extending into and even beyond the normal male range.”The IAAF also makes it clear that science is on its side. In its report it writes: “There is a broad medical and scientific consensus that if these iniduals are sensitive to androgens (ie, they have properly-functioning androgen receptors), such very high levels of natural testosterone can increase their muscle mass and strength, as well as their levels of circulating haemoglobin, and so significantly enhance their sporting potential.“This evidence shows clearly that (at least in certain events) DSD athletes with levels of circulating testosterone in the normal male range have a very significant competitive advantage over female athletes with testosterone levels in the normal female range.”“To the best of our knowledge, there is no other genetic or biological trait encountered in female athletics that confers such a huge performance advantage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beb197a4ef8aec1fc9c5b036d8ea40e661cefc3f/0_88_3440_2064/master/3440.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94b42b17a895f69f13e505b53bf2ffd9","title":"moeen ali england test side ipl interview","story":"The England all-rounder’s appraisal of his Ashes and New Zealand tour reveals something of an identity crisis but he is relishing the IPLWhen Moeen Ali was taken aside by Joe Root in Christchurch last month and told he would sit out the final instalment of England’s troubled Test winter, the overriding emotion that followed was not one of frustration.Having never before been dropped during a 50-cap run in the side – one that was interrupted only once by injury – Moeen actually thanked Root for his honesty and sticking by him for so long. But by his own admission, this hook from the stage should have come sooner.“When I didn’t play the last Test in New Zealand it was a relief,” says Moeen at the Taj hotel in Mumbai during what is a hectic Indian Premier League schedule with his new team, Royal Challengers Bangalore.“I could have been dropped three Tests earlier – I probably should have been – but Joe said he sees me as a match-winner and, with 50 matches of experience, they wanted to give me a longer run. It was almost like: ‘Right, now I can actually work on my game and mentally have a break from the pressure of playing.’ When it’s my time again, I will be ready.”But how did it come to this? Only last year Moeen was the toast of the England team, with the beaming smile that sits above a luxuriant beard dominating the sports pages during a man-of-the-series performance against South Africa. His 252 runs and 25 wickets – the latter including a hat-trick at The Oval – was an English record for an all-rounder over four Tests.The Ashes, however, was a different story. Injured in the buildup, Moeen went on to average 19 with the bat and 115 with the ball over the course of the 4-0 defeat. His own appraisal reveals something of an identity crisis for a player whose selfless, team-first approach had seen his role forever in flux.“I have been up and down the batting order and it’s difficult. People don’t always realise that. If you look at my last 18 months, I went to from batting four and five in India – scoring two hundreds – then to No 7 as second spinner at home before dropping to No 8. When we got to Australia I was down to bat six, then went to seven when the series started. You don’t really know your role.“You do your best but I think I’m going to try and get back in as a batsman first, spinner second. The problem is, because I have played more than others – say if Jack Leach is in the same team, or Liam Dawson or Adil Rashid before – I’ll still get seen as the senior spinner because I’m more experienced.”Has he been too nice for his own good? “I have been told in the past that’s my downfall but I’d rather be too nice to be honest. I set out in cricket to make friends. I’d rather people say they enjoyed playing with him and he’s a good guy, not he’s a good player but a bit of a so and so.”Moeen has always viewed himself as a batsman first and only Root, 11, and Alastair Cook, seven, can boast more than his five Test centuries since his debut in 2014. However the 30-year-old talks of his game “missing something” – perhaps a ruthlessness – and he cannot yet put his finger on it.Gary Kirsten, the former South African left-hander who heads up the RCB batsmen, is being tapped up for insight but whatever follows, we all hope it does not come at the expense of those buttery drives.The above could paint Moeen as a cricketer licking his wounds but it could not be further from the truth. Just as he did not get carried away last year, he is not down now either. He is loving his time in the IPL even if a lack of game time hampers his Test ambitions in the short-term.“If you asked me to play in the IPL for free, I would have done,” says Moeen, whose auction price of £187,000 was around a seventh of that of Ben Stokes. “I literally would have come for the experience, especially with the players at RCB like Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Brendon McCullum and Quinton de Kock.“And I’m wanting to train all of the time. Even today we’re not down to but I have asked to do some extra time. Sometimes in the same environment, you maybe lose a bit of that. So I think the IPL has come at a great time, getting different ideas from new voices.”Such as? “For example I have never worked on power-hitting. I’ve just always batted and when days have gone my way, it’s been nice. But with Trent Woodhill, one of the coaches, I’m learning different ways to hit the ball.“In Twenty20 it’s not always about straight drives and high elbows. It’s amazing how far you can hit the ball. I’ve always been able to hit the ball far but not consistently like I have in practice over here. I’m enjoying it so much.”With that Moeen heads off to his extra training session. Doubtless Worcestershire, two defeats from two upon their return to Division One this year, could do with his services and when it is put to him that this first-class absence means the Pakistan Test series at the end of May will likely come too soon, he replies: “It will be tough. But I know my time will come again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23b68889b1a43bb51fd27cbb7ac71c4dd1b80eab/0_91_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9e14f2229fa8847f08925e336a3e81a","title":"british adults using facebook less to communicate with friends","story":"British adults are becoming less reliant on Facebook for communicating with friends, according to research conducted by the UK media regulator, which suggests people are starting to turn to other social media apps.Ofcom’s data was primarily based on interviews with 1,875 iniduals aged over 16, with the main survey work conducted in autumn 2017. This was before the Cambridge Analytica story hit headlines around the world, raising widespread concerns about Facebook’s data usage and damaging the company’s brand. Although Britons appear to be slightly less loyal to the main Facebook site, the company may not be completely upset with the survey findings. While there has been a slight dip in the total number of adults who have an account on the social network, it remains utterly dominant with more than half of British adults saying they have an account.In addition, losing attention time to WhatsApp and Instagram is not catastrophic for Mark Zuckerberg’s company: both are already owned by Facebook.The Ofcom survey also found that the average British adult internet user spends 24 hours a week online and people are becoming less reliant on their televisions, with more than half of adults saying they watch on-demand or streaming content. Despite this, the report found a lack of understanding regarding online regulation, with three in 10 internet users incorrectly believing video content on YouTube is regulated and thinking “rules about offensive, harmful, unfair, inaccurate or biased content” apply to videos posted on the site by the general public.The majority of Britons said the benefits of being on the internet outweigh the risks, although the report’s authors said many people raised concerns about the impact of being online for substantial periods of time.“This connectivity can be overwhelming, with a third saying they would like to cut down on the time they spend online. It can also bring downsides, most notably nearly half of internet users say they have seen hateful content online in the past year.”According to Ofcom there is also a wealth ide in how Britons use the internet, with poorer iniduals more likely to rely solely on a smartphone to get online and have “lower levels of online confidence and critical understanding”.Facebook declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71316fe786e10dce40aaa2a492f087f4adc390f1/95_35_809_485/master/809.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a18ef68170fe79cd32ff34b3eae49164","title":"google gmail new ai confidential mode features smart replies greater offline access expiring emails improved safety features headline redesign","story":"Smart replies, greater offline access, expiring emails and improved safety features headline Google’s major redesignGoogle is implementing the biggest overhaul of its popular Gmail webmail service in five years, bringing a new look, advanced AI-powered features and improved privacy.Two years in the making, the redesign is intended to help Google better compete with Microsoft’s Outlook on the business side and modernise consumer email by bringing features from its Inbox email client into the main Gmail experience.“This is an entire rewrite of our flagship, most-used product,” said Jacob Bank, product manager lead for Gmail, which 1.4 billion people use each month.For consumers, headline features include the ability to snooze emails, as you would with an alarm clock, until a specified time or date, and what Google calls “nudge”, which displays messages with quick reminders that you haven’t responded to certain messages so that “nothing slips through the cracks”.The smart reply feature, found within Google’s Gmail app on smartphones that suggests quick reply phrases based on the content of the email, will also be rolled out to the web. Google said its new AI-powered features required Gmail to be underpinned by its self-developed Tensor processing chips, and that it had also restructured email storage databases, unifying three duelling systems for syncing messages across devices as part of the overhaul.Cosmetic changes also bring Gmail in line with Office, placing Google’s calendar, tasks and note-taking services within the same page as emails and alongside existing instant messaging options.Google has also improved Gmail’s phishing protection, with new, more dominant warnings about suspicious emails, and a new “confidential mode” that allows users to send emails with expiration dates, prevent the forwarding, copying, downloading or printing of emails and revoke previously sent emails. Emailers can also dictate that recipients have to input a one-time password to read certain messages, in an attempt to ensure that only the intended recipient receives the information.How this will work between Gmail and other email systems such as Microsoft’s Outlook or similar remains to be seen, but recent high-profile corporate data breaches have increased the company’s desire to lock down email.While many of the new features will be rolled out to the consumer version of Gmail first, it’s clear that Google’s approach for its email service has changed from consumer-centric to business-centric as it pushes its commercial G Suite products to business. Google is accelerating its efforts to poach business from Microsoft’s dominant Office system of email and apps, using Google Docs, Gmail, calendar and Hangouts instant messaging systems. Analysts estimate G Suite generated about $2bn in revenue last year, 10 times behind Office.One of the things holding G Suite back for businesses has been limited offline capabilities. Gmail now offers up to 90 days of emails offline, allowing users to search, write and manage messages without internet access in the browser.The changes to Gmail will roll out over the next few weeks with consumers able to opt into the new look by selecting the “Try the new Gmail” option under settings once it is available. Changes to the G Suite system will require system administrators to turn on options before they are available to workers using the Google tools."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b1e6e2c8eaf0753e19c958f2d753c75cc5fbe88/0_171_5126_3076/master/5126.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d683eaec0976ea23e568faae3917b62","title":"google youtube kids app parent control what children watch","story":"Enhanced controls will allow parents to handpick videos among a host of new features, but campaigners say YouTube must do moreGoogle is updating its YouTube Kids app to improve the control over the videos and channels that can be watched by children.YouTube Kids is a separate app for smartphones and tablets that provides access to a subset of the videos available on the main site. There have been 70bn video views since the app, which is used by 11m families, launched in 2015. In the app’s biggest change yet, Google is giving parents much greater control over what their children can find and watch.In controls rolling out later this year, parents will be able to manually approve inidual videos or channels that their children can access through the app, giving them the ability to pre-vet and handpick a collection of videos to ensure they are appropriate.Google is also creating collections of videos and channels from trusted channels such as Sesame Workshop and the YouTube Kids team, so that parents can select only the collections or topics they would like their children to have access to.James Beser, product director for YouTube Kids, said said: “From collections of channels from trusted partners to enabling parents to select each video and channel themselves, we’re putting parents in the driver’s seat like never before.”In addition the firm will limit the video recommendations the app will make to only those from channels that have been verified by the YouTube Kids team, when parents turn off the search function within the app. Previously recommendations could include content from any video or channel that is accessible through the YouTube Kids app, not just those verified by Google’s team.Google is also rolling out signed-in profiles for YouTube Kids across Europe, the Middle East and Asia this week, which means parents can create inidual profiles for each of their children on shared devices.Beser said that the current version of the app will still be available for those who are content to use it, but that Google was continuing to “fine tune” its filters for the more open selection of content, encouraging parents to block and flag content they do not see as appropriate.Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, saw the move as broadly positive, but said that more parental controls do not absolve Google of its responsibility to keep inappropriate content out of the YouTube Kids app.“It’s been clear for a long time now that algorithmic filtering on YouTube Kids doesn’t work and giving parents the ability to select more human-reviewed content is an improvement,” Golin said. “But let’s not forget that most kids are watching the main YouTube platform, where they not only exposed regularly to inappropriate recommendations and content, but also ensnared by Google’s troubling data collection practices.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb62211994aef7c3a63fc44367ac27e122b87d2d/0_129_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6372adc3d04ad52b639259c360b57920","title":"jeff bezos the boy who wanted to colonise space","story":"From a young age, the Amazon founder had dreamed up unlikely-sounding schemes. And then one took offIn 1994, Jeff Bezos held 60 meetings with family members, friends and potential investors in an attempt to persuade them to invest $50,000 (£35,000) in his revolutionary idea to create an online bookshop. He failed to convince 38 of them, and 24 years later some of them still cannot bring themselves to talk about what life might have been like if they had taken a punt on Bezos and this “Amazon thing” that the then 30-year-old hedge fund manager wouldn’t shut up about.They have given away $68m of it through their Bezos Family Foundation, which focuses on education. The foundation’s mission statement is a Winston Churchill quote: “What is the use of living, if it be not to strive for noble causes and to make this muddled world a better place for those who will live in it after we are gone?”Bezos’s parents have also given $65m to Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Jackie Bezos, who was 17 and still in high school when Jeff was born, said the donation was: “The gift of time for all those people who will benefit from new treatments and cures. It’s the gift of more hugs, more graduations and more moments.” Bezos tweeted: “My parents rock.”Many industry experts reckon Amazon – which has spread its tentacles into webhosting, TV production and high-end grocery chain Whole Foods – is growing so fast that it will overtake Apple, (Alphabet) Google and Microsoft to become the first trillion-dollar company. Amazon has a market value of $750bn (£538bn) – at Monday night’s share price – making it nearly three times the size of Walmart and more than 30 times the size of the UK’s biggest retailer, Tesco.Bezos has been very, very rich for a long time, but he has only recently started to really spend his billions. In 1999, when he was already worth well north of $9bn, Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, were still living in the one-bedroom apartment in Seattle they had rented when they moved to the city to set up Amazon five years earlier. That year the couple bought their first big house, a $10m mansion on Lake Washington, in the city’s most chichi neighbourhood.Today, however, Bezos owns almost a dozen homes across the US, and is the country’s 25th-largest landowner, according to the Land Report, a magazine that tracks US land ownership. He has made his first tentative steps into giving away a fraction of his fortune, but Bezos seriously lags behind his technology billionaire contemporaries in philanthropy. Bezos would still be the world’s second-richest man if Microsoft founder Bill Gates had not given away more than $36bn. Gates, along with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Netflix’s Reed Hastings and dozens of the world’s other billionaires have signed up to the Giving Pledge commitment to give away at least half of their fortunes. So far, however, Bezos has not joined up. After being questioned about his apparent reluctance, he tweeted a request for ideas for a “philanthropy strategy”. Last year, he tweeted to thank his 400,000 followers for their input and promised “more to come”.Bezos made his first big donation earlier this year: a $33m grant to a scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children. TheDream.US donation will fund scholarships for 1,000 participants of Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (Daca) programme, who are often called Dreamers. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal grants or loans, and are prevented from accessing state aid for tuition in 44 states. President Donald Trump has made life harder for Dreamers by announcing the end of Daca.Bezos’s previous biggest donation was also political: $2.5m to a campaign to defend same-sex marriage law in Washington state (the state that includes Seattle) in 2012. Jennifer Cast, a former Amazon employee who is a lesbian, emailed Bezos directly on a Sunday asking him to please consider donating between $100,000 and $200,000. “I want to have the right to marry the love of my life and to let my children and grandchildren know their family is honoured like a ‘real’ family,” Cast told Bezos. “We need help from straight people. To be very frank, we need help from wealthy straight people who care about us and who want to help us win.”Bezos replied on the Tuesday: “Jen, this is right for so many reasons. We’re in for $2.5m. Jeff \u0026amp MacKenzie.”Bezos, whom Trump has repeatedly attacked for avoiding tax at Amazon, did not acknowledge the politics of his Dreamers donation. He said the gift was in recognition of the help given to his father, who was one of 14,000 students who fled to the US from Cuba in the early 60s. His mother married Mike when Jeff was four years old, and he was legally adopted.Jorgensen, a unicyclist and bicycle shop owner, did not know he was the father of a billionaire until he was tracked down by journalist and author Brad Stone. In research for The Everything Store, his biography of Bezos, Stone turned up unannounced at Jorgensen’s Road Runner Bike Center shop in Glendale, Arizona in 2013.“I didn’t know where he was, if he had a good job or not, or if he was alive or dead,” Jorgensen told Stone. Jorgensen died in 2015.By all accounts, Bezos was gifted from a very early age. When he was a toddler he used a screwdriver to dismantle his cot because he wanted to sleep in a real bed. His genius at school is recorded for posterity in a 1977 book Turning On Bright Minds: A Parent Looks at Gifted Education in Texas, which profiles a sixth-grade Houston pupil called “Tim”. Tim, who was enrolled in a gifted children programme, is described as reading dozens of books far in advance of his years and of being incredibly interested in science. The author described him as “friendly, but serious” and of general intellectual excellence, but according to his teachers “not particularly gifted in leadership”. Tim was revealed in Stone’s book to be a pseudonym for Jeff Bezos.While Stone was widely praised for such an intimate portrait of Bezos, one reviewer on Amazon gave his book one star (the lowest possible). The reviewer was MacKenzie Bezos, who said it was littered with “numerous factual inaccuracies”.Bezos met MacKenzie at D E Shaw, a hedge fund run by computer scientist David Shaw, who is known as “King Quant” because of the firm’s pioneering role in high-speed quantitative trading. Until he met MacKenzie, when he interviewed her for a job at the hedge fund, Bezos had attempted to apply analytics to finding love. He called it “women flow” and reckoned he could increase the number of women he’d have a chance with if he took up ballroom dancing.In a profile of MacKenzie to promote her novel Traps, she told Vogue that it was she who had chased Bezos and not the other way round. Within three months, they were engaged and after another three months they married. Shortly afterwards Bezos described his idea for selling books over the internet, and while admitting she had “no business sense whatsoever” she could see “how excited he was” and agreed they should leave New York for Seattle to explore his idea. Seattle was chosen because it was close to a big book distributor and under US law the company was only required to collect sales tax for in-state sales.At high school near Miami, Bezos decided he wanted to go into space when he grew up. But, his ambition was not to be an astronaut he wanted to colonise space. He was named valedictorian of his high school class and when he graduated in 1982, the Miami Herald asked for an interview. The 18-year-old Bezos told the paper he wanted to “build space hotels, amusement parks and colonies for 2 million or 3 million people who would be in orbit”. “The whole idea is to preserve the Earth,” he told the paper. “The goal was to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park.”Recently a Bezos-owned rocket called New Shepard sent a mannequin named Skywalker into orbit and the billionaire’s Blue Origin space tourism and exploration company is planning to send its first customers – including Bezos – into space next year.

It is a collaboration of 18 media organisations in 15 different countries, including the , Reuters, Le Monde and the New York Times.The project is the first to be led by\u0026nbspForbidden Stories, an international network of journalists who stand ready to take over when colleagues are silenced through imprisonment or murder.The project will publish a series of fresh revelations, setting out the dangers that alleged political corruption and poor controls on money laundering inside Malta pose to law and order in Europe.Caruana Galizia died before being able to publish any findings from the leak. However, three energy experts in London have examined the files. They contain pricing information and contracts that Malta’s current government has so far refused to share with the public. Some of the material concerns a deal with Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil and gas company Socar, worth more than €1bn, under which Malta agreed to import all the gas needed to supply its power stations for the next 10 years.Over the past year, Malta has paid at least €131.6m ($153m at annualised exchange rates) for its gas – nearly twice the open market rate.Maltese taxpayers were losing money “hand over fist”, according to one expert.The deal was struck with Socar in 2015. Benchmarking indicated Malta was paying a significantly higher rate than similar purchases from the wider market negotiated at that time by Greece, Italy and Turkey. Estimates by the  suggest Socar paid $40m less for the gas than the sum it charged Malta.The gas is transported in liquid form, known as liquefied natural gas. Experts said there were questions to answer about why Socar, which had no relevant experience in producing or trading LNG when the deal was signed, was chosen as Malta’s partner. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by any of the parties involved. However, the lack of a public tender for the gas contract, and the absence of public information about its structure and costs, have hampered scrutiny and debate about whether the government secured the best deal for taxpayers, opposition politicians claim.Malta’s Labour government says its energy market policy has been a success. By switching its power stations from fuel oil to cheaper, cleaner gas, it has slashed household electricity bills by a quarter.The former Nationalist party leader Simon Busuttil said: “There was a total lack of transparency on this contract.“It took the government two years to publish it and even then, the juicy parts were blacked out. There is now the inexplicable involvement of Socar, when the gas could have been purchased directly from Shell at a cheaper price.“There is a fixed price for an unreasonably long time. And there is also a huge markup being made by Socar for no contribution at all, at the expense of Maltese taxpayers.”The leaked material concerns a company called Electrogas, which is one third owned by Socar.Electrogas has played a key role in Malta’s transition from using fuel oil to LNG. Liquefied gas can arrive by sea, which is crucial to the island nation because it has no gas pipelines connected to mainland Europe.In 2013, Malta held an open competition for a company to build facilities at Delimara on the southern tip of the main island. The company would import LNG, store it, convert the liquid back into gas and pump it into turbines operated by the state-owned utility Enemalta.The winning bidder was also required to build turbines of its own, to supply Enemalta with electricity. The Electrogas consortium was selected, in a public process in which 18 bidders expressed an interest. Leaked tender documents show Enemalta requested a fixed price for the first five years. Because the price of the gas was included in the cost of the bid, there was no separate public tender for the LNG supply contract. In 2015, Electrogas signed contracts to buy all the gas Malta needed from Socar. Regular deliveries began in April 2017, once its facilities at Delimara were built.Azerbaijan is a major oil and gas producer, but it does not produce LNG. The Daphne Project has established that Socar is not supplying the gas from its own reserves. It is in fact buying the gas from Shell and selling it on to Electrogas at a profit. Socar does not handle the gas, organise its transportation or add value in any physical process.The most recent delivery from Shell, on 22 March, appears to have come from fields off Trinidad and Tobago, via a tanker called Maran Gas Apollonia.Until now, Malta’s taxpayers were in the dark about the exact figures, because the government has only published the relevant contracts in redacted form. The Daphne Project has seen the originals.Since April 2017, when regular LNG shipments to Malta began, Socar has apparently benefited from the discrepancy between the fixed and market rates. Oil and gas prices tumbled between 2014 and 2016, and are only just beginning to recover. The cost of LNG is still well below the fixed price Malta is committed to paying.Simon Pirani, a senior visiting research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said: “If I were a Maltese taxpayer, I would want to know why such a poor deal was signed, and why a Socar subsidiary had been brought in as a seller of LNG.”Two other specialists, who asked to remain anonymous, reviewed the contracts and said a five-year commitment on the agreed terms was unheard of.“Socar are getting paid double by the Maltese utility,” said one. “That’s a huge margin. Malta should push to renegotiate that contract, because they are losing money hand over fist.”Konrad Mizzi, the Maltese tourism minister, steered the project through in his previous role as minister for energy. In a six-page letter to the , he said his government’s initiatives had secured hundreds of millions in investment from corporations and banks. The switch from oil to gas had lowered electricity prices and improved air quality.He said Malta’s energy sector had been “in desperate need of a complete overhaul”, with Enemalta in debt despite charging some of the highest prices per customer in Europe.The state provider’s financial woes were one of the main reasons for outsourcing the whole gas supply chain, he said. The decision had been shaped by advice from international law firms and specialist consultants, he said, and received financial backing from a consortium of leading banks.Mizzi argued the cost of the five-year fixed term was worth paying because “security of supply and price stability were paramount”.The European commission, which says it was made aware of the pricing details, raised no objections and approved the deal in January 2017.A spokesperson for the commission’s directorate general for competition, which approved the deal, said its role had been to check Electrogas was not being overpaid by Enemalta, rather than inspect the deal with Socar in isolation. It had concluded that the rate of return for Electrogas was “in line” with similar projects. However, among the leaked material is a report by a UK consultancy hired by Electrogas to analyse the costs, in order to convince banks to invest. In the report, the consultancy questioned Socar’s involvement. “The arrangement is unusual,” an adviser noted, “and typically one would expect the LNG supplier, in this case Shell, to contract directly with the project.”In a convoluted chain, the gas Malta needs is sold by Shell to Socar, which then sells it to Electrogas, which sells it on to the majority state-owned grid operator, Enemalta. For the first five years of the 10-year contract with Socar, Malta has committed to a fixed price of €9.40 ($11.50) per mmbtu, a unit of gas. Since deliveries began in April 2017, the average price per unit on the UK NPB, a widely used indicator for Europe’s wholesale liquified gas market, has been $6.20 – nearly half the Maltese fixed rate.This does not include transportation costs, whereas the €9.40 does. But Socar is still paying much less for the gas than the price at which it sells to Malta.Malta buys a minimum of 14m mmbtu per year under the deal with Socar. Using average exchange rates for the past year, Malta paid an estimated $153m to Socar for gas.This represents a potential $40m profit for the Azerbaijani energy company. Socar declined to comment on pricing, saying it was restricted by confidentiality clauses.Malta could not have foreseen the sustained oil and gas price crash that has made its deal with Socar look like poor value. However, it has the option to redraw or cancel the agreement. Other countries have done this: Lithuania secured a price cut from its supplier, Statoil, and the Italian energy company Edison went to court to reduce the cost of its deal with Algeria."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bc8b2f76de14a7c6deff98825e9b7138423331e/0_14_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1c65e2ed947537ad6476d8177b6b31d","title":"south korea japan north korea dessert islands mango mousse","story":"Tokyo opposes South Korea’s mango mousse showing map of Korean peninsula, including disputed islandsJapan has demanded that South Korea rethink a mango mousse dessert it plans to serve at summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, because it features a map of the Korean peninsula, including islands disputed with Japan. The mousse, labeled “Spring of the People” in a publicity photo, features islands known as Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in Korea, which lie about halfway between the east Asian neighbours in the Sea of Japan, which Seoul refers to as the East Sea.“It is extremely regrettable,” a Japanese foreign ministry spokeswoman said on Wednesday, adding that Japan had lodged a protest. “We have asked that the dessert not be served.”Japan complained to South Korea about fans waving a flag with a similar design at a friendly women’s ice hockey match at the Winter Paralympics between the combined North and South Korean team and Sweden in March. The new dispute comes as Kim and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, prepare to meet to discuss Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme on Friday.Relations between the two Koreas and Japan have long been strained by territorial disputes and lingering resentment over Japanese colonisation of the Korean peninsula in the first half of last century. Japan in the past has also protested against the erection of statues commemorating Korean women and girls forced to work in Japanese military brothels during the second world war. Seoul says that Tokyo has yet to deliver a heartfelt apology for its wartime actions.But Moon and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, have vowed to present a united front and exert pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programmes, which it pursues in defiance of UN security council resolutions.

He has no retirement fund in place and would use the Lifetime Isa to save for the long-term futureUnfortunately, the nature of being self-employed means there’s no regularity in how often I’m paid. Projects can be sporadic and uncertain. Invoices can be delayed, projects can drag on or I can just not win work for a while. If I don’t work, I don’t make money. It’s a scary and risky career but it’s very rewarding at times.I pay myself a set salary that helps me limit how much I spend each month, and keeps the money I shouldn’t spend in my business. I also put some of this salary into my savings. Anything extra I earn at the end of the year usually goes into my savings too. It’s definitely stressful though. I sometimes worry if I’ll carry on making enough money as each year passes, but if I can stay organised with my business and earnings, I can relax a lot more.As well as having an unreliable income, it’s also challenging having to calculate how much I’ll spend in expenses for my business and how much tax I’ll owe each year. There are days I wish I was employed again, so I could rely on a steady stream of income and know how much I can actually put into my savings each month. However, the upside of being freelance is that I can earn a higher amount each month than I normally would when working for a company, which makes the opportunity to save far greater.The main attraction of a Lifetime Isa for me is the prospect of having a retirement fund for when I’m older. Being self-employed, I don’t currently have a pension and it’s scary knowing I have nothing to fall back on. I’m hitting 30 this year and having a Lifetime Isa or a pension is a must for me now. I’m always one to want to find the best option possible and other Isas currently on the market don’t feel worthwhile any more.There’s nothing worse than constantly saving and never enjoying your money. My wife and I are hooked on travel and like to see as much of the world as possible. Aside from wanting to build a financial safety net for the future, our main saving goal is to have enough to enjoy ourselves along the way.Laura Lucas, 29, is a marketing assistant in Manchester and a lifestyle blogger in her spare time. She is considering a Lifetime Isa to save for her first houseI blog most evenings, which doesn’t provide much income, but I hope it’ll be my main job one day. Blogging is good in that I can save money that I might have otherwise spent on dinner out or a new outfit, because I’m lucky enough to get gifted these sorts of things. I feel like I’m currently working two jobs, one that I love but which doesn’t pay, and my main job that I rely on for income. My partner and I got engaged over Christmas, so we’re saving for a wedding in about two years’ time, as well as starting to think about buying our first home together. We’ll probably do the wedding on a budget with some special bits and bobs thrown in, but we’ll have to plan ahead to make sure we can afford the extravagant extras. I’d also love to have an engagement party in the next few months and it’s my partner’s 30th birthday this year, so even though we want to celebrate these occasions in style we might have to dial them down a little to save money. We both work really hard, so we don’t want to cut out anything like holidays or evening drinks with friends. I like to think I’m a good saver, and a Lifetime Isa would help us to save for our first house. It’s great to have something backed by the government to help young people save. It’s challenging these days but a Lifetime Isa encourages you to think long term about home ownership and retirement. I already have a couple of savings accounts that I sometimes dip into for Christmas and birthdays, holidays and more expensive purchases, but setting these accounts up can be stressful. It takes a lot of research and background work to fully understand what you’re getting when you sign up.At the moment, I’m not quite sure where I want to be money-wise. I’m grateful for my living situation and being able to live comfortably. However, there are many more things we’d love to do, like decorating our apartment and travelling more, but with our wedding and buying a house on the horizon, we’re trying to be a bit more sensible and only invest small amounts at a time in things we know we need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7367799adc822bdfd24c4f8625cef7eff67e830/0_80_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d69f76f4e11be8bdd1e38e50a78438","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt. But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsTHE IRISH TIMES Former minister for health James Reilly has called on the major supermarket chains to stop selling cigarettes.He said he would like to see Tesco, Supervalu, Dunnes Stores and other big retailers end the sale of tobacco products because they were “supposed to be providers of food and nourishment and nutritional goods”.He said “they should take the lead and stop selling” cigarettes.Dr Reilly also called for a change in licensing regulations “so we don’t have any longer this situation where one licence covers all your outlets”.He said each outlet should have a licence and “transgressions of that licence should be punishable by real fines of at least €5,000 plus losing the right to sell tobacco for a year”.These were “real sanctions” he hoped the Department of Health would progress.Dr Reilly was introducing a proposal, unanimously accepted by the Seanad, for the Minister for Health to amend legislation by extending the ban on smoking to places where food is served outdoors.His proposal to ban smoking where food is served outdoors was accepted without a vote by the Seanad.Dr Reilly, a GP, said the issue was personal for him because his father had a stroke and was left blind for the last 14 years of his life due to smoking.His brother was a public health doctor but was unable to quit the habit and died of lung cancer aged 60 and more recently his brother-in-law aged 62 also died of lung cancer.“So for me this is personal and for me it is professional as a doctor having seen all the suffering I’ve seen and as politician for me it has to be one of our main political ambitions to create a tobacco-free society”.That would mean having a prevalence of smoking of less than 5 per cent with the target date of 2025. The current rate is 18 per cent.Dr Reilly, who introduced plain packaging on tobacco products in Ireland, said “I believe we’re winning because young people between the ages of 12 and 17 in recent surveys, less and less of them are smoking”.He said that 6,000 Irish men and women die every year as a direct result of smoking.“It is the only legal product that we know of that when used as directed by the manufacturer will kill one in two of its habitual users.”He added that 1.6 million deaths related to smoking occur every year in the European region and second hand smoking causes 890,000 premature deaths globally every year.Minister of State for Health Catherine Byrne, who supported the motion, said both her mother and father smoked.Ms Byrne said she was astonished when she passed a maternity hospital on her way into work “at the amount of women, quite pregnant, standing outside with a drip and smoking at the same time.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3474340.1524690634!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar lambasts ff for promising extra spending","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil spokesperson on finance Michael McGrath:  “We are the party of fiscal responsibility,” he said.

On Wednesday night, a Sinn Féin motion calling for more resources, better working conditions and pay rises was supported by many Fianna Fáil deputies.In response to Mr Varadkar’s remarks, the Fianna Fáil finance spokesman Michael McGrath said his party had “proved our credentials – we have agreed two budgets under the agreement and we are committed to a third”.“We are the party of fiscal responsibility,” he said. “We’ve secured Government agreement for a rainy day fund and that will become a reality in 2019.“This is political mudslinging and you’d have to question what his motives are.”Mr Varadkar’s attack on Fianna Fáil comes after he clashed with the Fianna Fáil leader in the Dáil on Wednesday, when the Taoiseach accused Mr Martin’s party of dishonesty: “when people go around the country promising every interest group they will do everything they ask this year. That is not possible . . . That is what Deputy Micheál Martin’s party is doing.“As is always the case, the truth hurts. That is what Deputy Micheál Martin’s party is doing and I am keeping a record of all the promises his spokespersons are making as the weeks go by.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"stormy daniels michael cohen acts like he is above the law","story":"  April 17, 2018Michael Cohen forced to disclose Fox News presenter\u0026rsquos name during court hearing "},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

Children in developing countries who cannot access care are particularly vulnerable, Dr Zaidi added..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they areDr Anita Zaidi“Rotavirus is a disease that can kill within hours. Children can become severely dehydrated and die on the way to a clinic or hospital. But it’s not just about deaths. I’m a paediatrician and it’s important we do whatever we can to keep kids out of hospital,” she said.The Gates Foundation is highlighting the importance of vaccines with the launch of a video by Aardman Animations, creators of Wallace and Gromit. According to data from the World Health Organization there has been an 84 per cent fall in the number of measles deaths since the introduction of a vaccine against the disease. And so far this year there have been just eight cases of polio thanks to the global vaccination campaign.Heather Wright, executive producer at Aardman, said the campaign had a simple message: to urge parents and carers to get their child vaccinated.\u0026quotYou would throw yourself in front of a bus to protect your child so why wouldn\u0027t you get your child immunised?\u0026quot she said. According to the latest data 95 countries have introduced a vaccine against rotavirus, and 22 have plans to do so. These include many high-income countries such as the UK and the US, and low-income countries which receive financial help from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.However, around 75 countries have not introduced the vaccine: these include middle income countries such as China, Russia, Egypt and Chile which do not qualify for support from Gavi. Dr Zaidi said that countries had many competing priorities but stressed that the vaccine was not only good for a nation’s health, but also economic prospects. In many countries, where there is no system of health coverage, people face financial ruin when they or members of their family are hospitalised.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016A recent study looked at the impact of the introduction of various vaccines, including rotavirus, on 41 low and middle-income countries between 2016 and 2030. It predicted that as well as averting 819 deaths for every one million people vaccinated the rotavirus vaccine would also prevent 242,000 people from facing catastrophic health costs.Dr Zaidi said: “People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they are. People in low income countries need to recognise what powerful tools vaccines are for reducing the health and financial burden of the poor.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Former Ukip chairman sues party over cream crackers in unpaid expenses rowKanye West says Donald Trump is his brother - US President says \u0026#39cool\u0026#39 Japanese knotweed cannot be cured, major study which tried 19 methods findsMayfair chef warns Michael Gove\u0026#39s lobster plan could ruin their seafood dishesTurkish court jails 14 staff from opposition newspaperUniversity Challenge\u0026#39s gender-balanced questions backfire as contestants fail to answer themAlfie Evans\u0026#39s father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddlerRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Royal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementRevealed: first area of UK where majority of children are overweight or obeseNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

Former prime minister David Cameron has a son called Arthur.Queen Victoria used to insist that the name Albert was used as a middle name by her descendants, if not a first, in honour of her much-loved consort Prince Albert.By choosing Albert or Bertie for a boy, the Duke and Duchess would be honouring Queen Elizabeth II\u0027s father, George VI, who was actually Albert Frederick Arthur George but always known to his family as Bertie.Shy, stammering Bertie was forced to become king when his brother Edward VIII abdicated, but won the nation\u0027s affection by standing firm in London during the Second World War.A lasting tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh might see the new Prince of Cambridge called Philip.Both Prince Charles and Prince William have Philip as a middle name.The Duke of Edinburgh - known for his dedication to duty and his acerbic wit - has been married to the Queen for more than 70 years and is the nation\u0027s longest serving consort.A Prince Freddie of Cambridge would have a historical link to the 1st Duke of Cambridge.Prince Adolphus Frederick lived from 1774 to 1850 and was a son of George III.He was apparently very fond of interrupting church services by bellowing out \u0026quotBy all means\u0026quot if the priest said \u0026quotLet us pray\u0026quot.William may want to pay tribute to his father - but perhaps as a middle name as it may be considered too similar to Charlotte.James could be chosen to signify the Duchess\u0027s affection for her brother, the baby\u0027s uncle, James Middleton.William already has a cousin James, the Earl and Countess of Wessex\u0027s son, Viscount Severn.James is a Stuart name. James I, son of Mary, Queen of Scots, had been king of Scotland for 36 years as James VI when he became king of England in 1603.They could choose William as a middle name for a boy, but also perhaps Michael as a middle name out of respect for Kate\u0027s father.Kate\u0027s grandfather on her paternal side was called Peter, while on her maternal side, her grandfather was Ronald.Thomas also appears several times in Kate\u0027s family tree, as does Francis.When it comes to godparents, the youngest Cambridge child might well be dealt the best hand yet. After seven years of marriage (and three children), the Duke and Duchess now know exactly who their real friends are.Plus, with 12 godparents between them, Prince George and Princess Charlotte have already ticked off all those their parents felt obliged to ask. Admittedly a few of their oldest and best friends have already been bagged – Emilia d’Erlanger, for example, is George’s godmother and Prince William’s friend, Tom Van Straubenzee belongs to Chalotte – but there are plenty more of their friends waiting in the wings, as well as a few close cousins. Click here for our best guestimate at who might be in the frame for possible godparents to the new prince.Some of the runners and riders in our shortlist in the race to become the youngest royal\u0026#39s godparents It would be a worst nightmare for most new mothers, but the Duchess of Cambridge had a close knit team of helpers on hand to help ensure she looked her best for her moment in front of the world\u0027s media.For the past few years, the Duchess has worked closely with former PA Natasha Archer and hairdresser Amanda Cook Tucker to ensure that her every public appearance is pristine.Natasha Archer and Amanda Cook Tucker arriving to tend to Kate after the birth of Prince GeorgeThe duo are often spotted loading vanity cases and suit carriers onto the royal jet during tours or lurking behind the scenes to tend to the Duchess whenever she needs.Here is everything you need to know about the Royal \u0026quotglam squad\u0026quot, who were on hand for the Duchess\u0027s Lindo Wing exit.Arthur remains the bookmakers\u0027 favourite for the new Royal baby\u0027s name, but James is the most popular for inidual wagers placed with Ladbrokes.James  has seen the largest amount of bets and money placed since the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth.It is the same name as the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s brother, James Middleton.

What we cherish is at stake. What we love is in danger. We have no choice but to prevail and together we shall prevail.\u0026quotHe also warned: “We can choose isolationism. But closing the door to the world will not stop the evolution of the world. If we decide to open our eyes wider, we will be much stronger.”The speech ended a three-day US state visit that has seen Mr Macron reaffirm his position as the world leader with the closest personal relationship with Mr Trump. The pair’s touchy-feely series of press engagements have made headlines in recent days and was referenced jokingly by Mr Macron in his address.  But the speech - the first joint session from a world leader since 2016 - showed Mr Macron was willing to publicly challenge the US president on policy. On climate change, Mr Macron asked “what is the meaning of our lives if we spend it destroying the future of our children?” He said it was time to “make our planet great again” - echoing Mr Trump’s campaign slogan - and predicted the US will \u0026quotone day\u0026quot return to the Paris climate change agreement. That triggered the biggest moment of applause as Democrats leapt to their feet while Republicans gave a more lukewarm response - one of a number of points when his speech split the chamber. \u0026quotI believe in building a planet for our children that is still inhabitable in 25 years,\u0026quot he said.In a pointed reference to Mr Trump, he added: \u0026quotSome people think that securing industries and current jobs is more important than climate change ... I hear this concern, but we must find a smooth transition.\u0026quot\u0026quotLet us face it. There is no planet B,\u0026quot he said.On the Iran nuclear deal, Mr Macron pledged France would stay in the 2015 agreement and criticised Mr Trump’s hints he will withdraw. However he repeated Tuesday’s call for a new wider deal that will tackle Iran\u0027s ballistic missile programme and behaviour in Syria and Yemen as well as nuclear issues. And Mr Macron pledged: \u0026quotIran shall never possess any nuclear weapons. Not now. Not in 5 years. Not in 10 years. Never.\u0026quotThe French president did not refrain from expressing his views on Mr Trump\u0026#39s policiesOn wider themes, Mr Macron repeatedly challenged Mr Trump’s instinct to disengage from the world - a prominent foreign policy theme in his 2016 election campaign. Mr Macron said: \u0026quotToday, the international community needs to step up our game and build the 21st century world order based on the perennial principles we established together after World War II.\u0026quotHe also said: \u0026quotWe must remember the warning of President Theodore Roosevelt: Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn\u0027t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, handed on for them to do the same.\u0026quotThe comments, alongside a demand for “strong multilateralism”, will be seen as a call for Mr Trump to stand by Nato and the UN and stay engaged in in the Middle East, especially Syria. Mr Trump said he was “looking forward” to watching the address before it begun but remained silent on Twitter during the speech.The French president is the first foreign leader since Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, in 2016 to be given the honour. \u0026quotI want you to know how much I appreciate this unique gesture, thank you,\u0026quot Mr Macron told the chamber.The speech saw all US senators and congressmen gather in the House of Representatives, the same venue of the president\u0027s \u0027state of the union\u0027 address. Gordon Brown was the last British prime minister to address a joint session of Congress in 2009. Tony Blair also did so in 2013. Mr Macron and his wife were the guest of honour at a state dinner on Tuesday night in the White House, designed by Mr Trump\u0027s wife Melania. The First Lady Melania was oversaw the intricate planning for the Trump administration\u0026#39s first state dinnerRupert Murdoch, the Australian media tycoon, and US Olympic champions were among senior US politicians in attendance. The new \u0027relation spéciale\u0027 between France and America has been on full display during Mr Macron’s state visit. “Mr President, they\u0027re all saying what a great relationship we have and they\u0027re actually correct,” Mr Trump told Mr Macron on Tuesday, “Finally, it’s not fake news.\u0026quot The leaders have made a great deal of their special relationship during the state visitThe pair have not disguised their policy differences but made much of their “special” friendship, not holding back on the flattery. “We have a very special relationship, in fact I’ll get that little piece of dandruff off,” Mr Trump joked on Tuesday, brushing at the French president’s shoulder.“We have to make him perfect, he is perfect.” Please review our commenting policyFormer Ukip chairman sues party over cream crackers in unpaid expenses rowKanye West says Donald Trump is his brother - US President says \u0026#39cool\u0026#39 Japanese knotweed cannot be cured, major study which tried 19 methods findsMayfair chef warns Michael Gove\u0026#39s lobster plan could ruin their seafood dishesTurkish court jails 14 staff from opposition newspaperUniversity Challenge\u0026#39s gender-balanced questions backfire as contestants fail to answer themAlfie Evans\u0026#39s father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddlerRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Royal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementRevealed: first area of UK where majority of children are overweight or obeseNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

We began focusing on knotweed at a time when there was a great deal of hysteria surrounding it.\u0026quotAt the time, most information for people affected by the plant was largely based on anecdote. This led to the prospect of unscrupulous companies offering expensive and ineffective treatment solutions.\u0026quotIt was incredible to us that there was no long-term, large-scale field trial analysis of the treatment methods used to control Japanese knotweed.\u0026quotAttempts to eradicate Japanese knotweed may not actually workAnd professor Dan Jones said gardening companies who claim to be able to eradicate the plant were not fully accurate.He said: \u0026quotOff the back of the first three years of data we\u0027ve found that eradication is not possible. Hopefully over the longer term we may move towards that by using new chemicals we\u0027re looking at.\u0026quotBut it\u0027s not a question of eradication, it\u0027s a question of sustained control and management and well informed control and management.\u0026quotClaims made by companies, stating that they could eradicate Japanese knotweed using herbicides in short spaces of time have now been proven to be false, based on our experiments.\u0026quotFurthermore, we have shown that applying the wrong herbicides at the wrong time of the year leads to greater herbicide use and environmental impacts.\u0026quotDr Jones said the best chemical to control the knotweed was glyphosate - but the herbicide is feared to pose a risk to other wildlife too.Dr Jones said: \u0026quotThere\u0027s a range of issues in terms of risk and hazard. There\u0027s a political issue around glyphosate as well.\u0026quotWhat we\u0027ve done is work with the biology of the plant to minimise the amount of herbicide we\u0027re using over a treatment life cycle.\u0026quotAlthough we\u0027re using quite a contentious herbicide in that respect, we are using far less of that herbicide than you would use for other products that don\u0027t work on Japanese knotweed.\u0026quotHousehunters looking at homes in areas dense with Japanese knotweed can often struggle to secure mortgages - over fears the roots could cause structural difficulties to buildings.Chartered surveyor David Gregson, who provides specialist advice on the issue, said: \u0026quotThe main problem is mortgage lenders are very reluctant to lend on properties where knotweed is present and obviously that means in turn people can\u0027t sell their properties and it might sometimes be because knotweed is present in the next door garden.\u0026quotA typical situation is a couple wanting to get orced. They\u0027ve got a lot of knotweed in their garden, they both want to move on with their lives and they\u0027ve got a house they can\u0027t sell.\u0026quotFormer Ukip chairman sues party over cream crackers in unpaid expenses rowKanye West says Donald Trump is his brother - US President says \u0026#39cool\u0026#39 Mayfair chef warns Michael Gove\u0026#39s lobster plan could ruin their seafood dishesTurkish court jails 14 staff from opposition newspaperUniversity Challenge\u0026#39s gender-balanced questions backfire as contestants fail to answer themAlfie Evans\u0026#39s father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddlerRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Royal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementRevealed: first area of UK where majority of children are overweight or obeseNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

And some vaccines, such as yellow fever, are recommended for particular regions. .html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}However, poor vaccine coverage is not just a problem in developing countries. Latest data from WHO shows that in Europe there were 21,000 cases of measles in 2017, compared to 5,000 the previous year.And this was partly due to a decline in the number of people vaccinated as well as a shortage in the supply of vaccines and poor disease surveillance, said WHO.The largest outbreaks of the disease were in Romania, where there were 5,562 cases and Italy, where there were 5,006 cases. In Germany there were 927 cases and the disease and in the UK there were 282. WHO launched the Global Vaccine Action Plan in 2011 with a goal to preventing millions of deaths but some key targets are off track.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016For example, 40 priority countries should have eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus by 2015 but only 18 countries have met this goal. And by 2016 at least four WHO world regions should have eliminated measles – only one, the WHO region of the Americas, has achieved this. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO, said World Immunisation Week, was an opportunity \u0026quotto remind everyone of the incredible value of vaccines\u0026quot.\u0026quotYes, vaccines work, vaccines prevent disease, vaccines save lives,\u0026quot he said. Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Former Ukip chairman sues party over cream crackers in unpaid expenses rowKanye West says Donald Trump is his brother - US President says \u0026#39cool\u0026#39 Japanese knotweed cannot be cured, major study which tried 19 methods findsMayfair chef warns Michael Gove\u0026#39s lobster plan could ruin their seafood dishesTurkish court jails 14 staff from opposition newspaperUniversity Challenge\u0026#39s gender-balanced questions backfire as contestants fail to answer themAlfie Evans\u0026#39s father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddlerRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Royal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementRevealed: first area of UK where majority of children are overweight or obeseNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

The mayor has capped the daily influx at 8,000, fearing that the Cycladic island is otherwise in danger of losing its charm.Campaigners from Santorini, Dubrovnik, Venice, Corfu and Rhodes gathered in Venice earlier this month to discuss how to control mass tourism.They blame low-cost flights and the booming cruise ship industry for bringing ever greater numbers of visitors, and home-letting websites such as Airbnb for emptying historic destinations of locals and killing off community spirit.Please review our commenting policyFormer Ukip chairman sues party over cream crackers in unpaid expenses rowKanye West says Donald Trump is his brother - US President says \u0026#39cool\u0026#39 Japanese knotweed cannot be cured, major study which tried 19 methods findsMayfair chef warns Michael Gove\u0026#39s lobster plan could ruin their seafood dishesTurkish court jails 14 staff from opposition newspaperUniversity Challenge\u0026#39s gender-balanced questions backfire as contestants fail to answer themAlfie Evans\u0026#39s father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddlerRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Royal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementRevealed: first area of UK where majority of children are overweight or obeseNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A spokesperson for the European Commission’s Brexit negotiating team said the scheme’s application to the UK would be part of discussions on the future relationship, where chief negotiator Michel Barnier has so far been unwilling to cut special deals for Britain.“Today’s agreement is another important step in protecting the EU’s external borders,” said Valentin Radev, the interior minister for Bulgaria, which is currently chairing the European Council. “By knowing who is coming to the EU before they even arrive at the border, we will be better able to stop those who may pose a threat to our citizens.”On Wednesday, ambassadors from the EU countries confirmed an agreement reached on the ETIAS scheme between the presidency of the European Council and the representatives of the European Parliament, who must agree any new EU laws. The European Parliament will now have to vote on the plan, which will also have to be signed off by the European Council.One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?The EU says the new scheme will “improve internal security, prevent illegal immigration, protect public health and reduce delays at the borders by identifying persons who may pose a risk in one of these areas before they arrive at the external borders”. Because it applies to the whole Schengen passportless area and not just the EU, travellers to countries outside the EU such as Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland would also be hit.Data submitted in the online application would be processed against EU police and Interpol databases, with further checks made against anyone who raises flags. Countries that already need visas to travel to Europe will not be covered by the scheme, given that tighter restrictions are already in place on them. Airlines and ferry lines will also have a new responsibility to check whether travellers who need documents have them, with coach operators scheduled to pick up the same rules three years after the scheme’s introduction.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Downing Street, where Mr Robbins now heads up the Brexit unit, however confirmed last week that UK negotiators are still arguing for the solutions proposed in the position papers in talks, stating that “the two proposals we have put forward remain the basis for our negotiation position”.The same proposals interrogated by Mr Sterling in the letter were reportedly rubbished by EU officials during the talks and subjected to a “systematic and forensic annihilation” during meetings with the European Commission in Brussels.The letter to Mr Robbins, dated 23 August 2017 says: “While the position papers have helpfully started a dialogue on movement of goods, many of the issues raised in June still require exploration.”While the position papers have helpfully started a dialogue on movement of goods, many of the issues raised in June still require explorationDavid Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland civil serviceGoing into detail about the issues with the UK customs proposals, Mr Sterling said plans to exempt small businesses from customs suffered from issues of practicality.“The iding line between businesses of different sizes in Northern Ireland supply chains will undoubtedly be blurred. This could make it difficult to accurately define which businesses are exempt from customs processes,” he said.“For example, bulk tankers owned or contracted by Irish milk processing firms collect raw milk from multiple farms in Northern Ireland before returning to Irish processing facilities.”He adds: “Small businesses trading on the island of Ireland may also be using inputs from outside these islands, or be part of an island of Ireland supply chain that ultimately sells into world markets.”The NI executive civil service chief also highlighted concerns with plans for a “robust enforcement mechanism” to keep goods from crossing the border.“The visibility and impact of a ‘robust enforcement mechanism’ to ensure goods not complying with the EU’s trade policy (whether through a lower tariff or erging standard) stay in the UK is a significant challenge,” he said.“The example of Turkey illustrates that customs duties are only one part of the picture and technical barriers can be equally disruptive to trade. Potential trade barriers created by erging tariffs or regulatory standards are therefore a key area for ongoing discussion. DAERA is currently engaged with DEFRA on complex sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) issues. “In a separate leaked document also seen by The Independent, an internal economic analysis drawn up by the Northern Ireland executive’s Department for the Economy warns that the province’s economy will suffer because of Brexit whatever solution is applied.“There is no quick or simple solution to the land border,” the assessment, dated May 2017 says. “There is likely to be some negative impact on the economy whether border controls are sited at the land or sea border, at least in the short-to-medium term. The policy question is therefore how these impacts can be minimised and what transitional support is required.”The Government has declined to comment on the leaks.There has still be little progress on the border question in talks this year, despite the opening of talks about the future relationship last week.Under the Good Friday Agreement there can be no hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and both sides agree that none should return. The EU however says the customs union and single market must have external border checks to maintain their integrity. Commission negotiators effectively proposed moving the customs checks to the Irish seat between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but Theresa May refused the approach after pressure from her allies in the DUP. Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

It was only when she was going through customs that she realised she was going into labour.Ms Freeman, a computer specialist in the US Air Force, revealed her amazing story in a Twitter thread, which has since been shared thousands of times. I’m literally gripping the railing trying to make it through the lines. At this point I feel like I’m about to pass out. I’m sweating. I feel like I have to vomit. I’m going through it. Then I’m like wait a minute b*tch are you in labor?!!! pic.twitterp6SMEfunP0Determined not to give birth in an airport, Ms Freeman made it to her hotel room and began searching on YouTube for the best way to deliver her baby. Filling a bath with warm water and grabbing two towels – one to bite onto, and one to wrap the baby in – she began pushing once her contractions started happening every minute. My contractions were already at a minute a part lol I was late as hell. I BARELY made it to my room. 😂😂😂 so I throw the towel in my mouth and start pushing. And I have NEVVVVEEERRRR felt any pain like this in my life. I felt like I was being split open. WHERE WAS MY EPIDURAL?! pic.twitterHGlootcNHuAfter five or six pushes, a baby “popped out” and “floated right on up to the top of the water”.Luckily it happened pretty quickly. I only had to push about 5-6x before a baby popped out. Lol now let me tell you babies are buoyant. That little joker said bloop and floated right on up to the top of the water 😂😂 pic.twitterIuqwKXFb2LAfter checking the sex of her newly-born baby, she was forced to search on Google as to how to cut an umbilical cord without any tools beyond a knife.So I didn’t have any clamps like it suggested but what I did have were shoelaces lol. Hear me out 😂. In Turkey everyone drinks teacoffee so every hotel room had an electric kettle. So I just boiled some water to sterilize the laces so that I could use them as clamps. pic.twitter2vObBQz6euUsing sterilised shoelaces as clamps, she managed to cut the cord before exhaustion began to set in. After cleaning up the bathroom, which looked like the set of a horror movie, she breastfed her newborn son and went to sleep. Waking up the next day, she headed to the airport to find out how she would leave the country with a newborn baby. When I get there the airport workers are freaking out bc you can tell this baby is fresh. I legit didn’t have any baby clothes \u0026amp made him something out of my favorite blue oversized button down (RIP 😢). Anyway they thought I was a human trafficker trying to smuggle out a baby. pic.twitterdc0BCDv75JAfter convincing local police and Turkish Airlines staff of her story, local media organisations were tipped off and she became headline news in the country. Is hypnobirthing the secret to Kate Middleton\u0027s \u0027effortless\u0027 births?Duchess of Cambridge gives birth to boyTwin brothers welcome babies on the same dayMs Freeman was eventually taken to the US Consulate in Istanbul, where she applied for a birth certificate and passport for her son, whom she named Xavier Ata Freeman. After being taken to hospital - almost 24 hours since giving birth - she was given the all clear and spent another two weeks in Istanbul, fully paid for by Turkish Airlines.To wrap up I go to the hospital get checked out everything is fine. He’s perfectly healthy! Lol the doctors were shocked to hear my story. I made national news \u0026amp people would stop us to take pictures all the time \u0026amp a random elderly woman grabbed my boob as I was breastfeeding pic.twittergGp4lJvEvlMs Freeman finally flew back to Nashville, her hometown, at the end of March.Here he is Xavier Ata Freeman born March 7, 2018 in Istanbul, Turkey! My little surprise bundle of international joy!Speaking to The Independent, Ms Freeman said her family were left absolutely stunned.No one had a clue, she said. But they were all extremely excited. It’s my parents\u0027 first grandchild and he makes the fifth living generation on my mum’s side.As soon as I flew back they all came to visit, bearing gifts and spoiling Xavier. They found out about four days after I gave birth to him while I was still in Istanbul. So of course they called every single day, wanting to talk to him and see pictures and videos and checking in to make sure we were okay.Looking back on the birth now, Ms Freeman says despite the risks, she probably wouldn\u0027t change a thing. What it’s like to give birth at the Lindo WingThe experience taught me so much. I learned how to be resourceful and calm under pressure. I was able to bond one on one with my son from his first breaths, she said. I’m thankful that everything went well and I was able to deliver a healthy baby, she added. I know everyone isn’t always so fortunate but I appreciate the experience and hopefully he’ll think it’s an amazing story when he’s older!And why she did not go to a hospital? Not many people spoke English that I encountered at first, she said. And I didn’t know what the country’s emergency number was and I didn’t know how my insurance would work overseas so I just decided to DIY it.Though Ms Freeman\u0027s birth was a success, the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) strongly discourages women from giving birth alone. “Whilst the RCM recognises that every woman has the right to give birth without professional assistance, there are potential risks for both mother and baby and for that reason the RCM would strongly discourage women from giving birth by themselves and without professional support or skilled medical help, an RCM spokesperson told The Independent.“The RCM also believes that the more we develop maternity services which enable women and midwives to get to know each other and for women to trust their midwife the less likely women are to choose to give birth without a midwife present.”On the huge reaction on social media, Ms Freeman said: I expected my friends to go crazy reading it but I didn’t expect it to get as big as it did. Though I probably should have, seeing as though everyone who knows the story loses their minds.I think all the tweets broke my Twitter.Read Ms Freeman\u0027s amazing story in full below.I still really don’t understand what’s so shocking about my delivery story. Lol maybe it’ll set in one day.Might as well tell you now lol. Give me a little time though because it’s sort of a long story 😂😂So then I’m in denial for another month after that like there’s no way a Bitch is preggo. At this point I’m working in VA and away from everyone so I just decided not to tell anyone. My dumbass was like maybe it’ll just go away... pic.twitterTtSMTqc7LnSo everything is going well no biggie but dawg this is a 14hr flight \u0026amp there was a complimentary meal but everything had meat in it \u0026amp you know I’m a vegetarian so I was like I can’t eat this but 14 hrs was too long to wait so I decided to eat the salmon hoping I wouldn’t get sick pic.twitter9CfF4XzYzTI’m like oooooh shit where are these cramps coming from? You know what I’ll just go to sleep. Sleep cures everything right pic.twitterz9QcUxdMtDI’m literally gripping the railing trying to make it through the lines. At this point I feel like I’m about to pass out. I’m sweating. I feel like I have to vomit. I’m going through it. Then I’m like wait a minute bitch are you in labor?!!! pic.twitterp6SMEfunP0Either way it goes I’m not giving birth in this airport so I start gassing myself up bc I am NOT having a baby in this airport. I start talking to myself like Bitch what you’re not gonna do is give birth on the airport floor. So you need to get it together \u0026amp make it to your hotel pic.twitterYwjk9fmsaDIt’s weird how focused a person becomes when they’re adrenaline starts going. Because at no point ever did I freak out. Like I just did what I had to do.So the internet said I shouldn’t start pushing until my contractions where 2mins apart. Bc you don’t want to exhaust yourself too early and then not have any energy when the kids ready to come, you know? And I’m like okay bitch you’ve got a timer on your phone. You can do this! pic.twitterQSi7iJ4vAxLuckily it happened pretty quickly. I only had to push about 5-6x before a baby popped out. Lol now let me tell you babies are buoyant. That little joker said bloop and floated right on up to the top of the water 😂😂 pic.twitterIuqwKXFb2LLol the story isn’t over yet 😂 he’s out but the placenta is still inside of me. Now according to the internet you’re not supposed to pull it out bc it has to seal itself back up or something idk lol.Can I just say that walking around with the umbilical cord hanging out of me totally gave me the impression of what it would be like to have a penis. 😂😂😂 pic.twitterDicpn2ljSqAlmost immediately as I sit down it plops out. The hotel had these sanitation baggies in the bathroom so I just picked it up by the cord and dropped it in the bag. Now it’s still attached to him so now I’ve got to google how to cut an umbilical cord. pic.twitterurJHrIu9mNAnd everyone knows that ya girl stays strapped 😎. I don’t go anyyyyyyyywhere without my knives. And because of this I’ll probably never go anywhere without them again. pic.twittervAbCZ6bb1KNow I haven’t been nervous this whole time but cuttingbthis cord is freaking me out lmao like what if I hurt this man?! So I’m poking the cord with the knife to see if it affects him. pic.twittermkmQfKP7S2Umbilical cord cut and I did a mighty fine job if I do say so myself 😌! At this point exhaustion is beginning to set in. But I need to clean up the bathroom because it looked like the set of a horror movie pic.twitterDyvlwXXeQ2I didn’t know what I would need to leave the country with a newborn baby and I thought no better place to ask than the airport. pic.twitterwTEhjfoIqCIdk how they found out but someone tipped them off to my story and they had all the questions lol. If you google my name and Istanbul Turkey articles will pop up 😂😂😂. It’s all in Turkish though so good luck with that lol 🤷🏾‍♀️pic.twitterJsHQEUjtMySo the translator is like like miss maybe later. The reporter was like okay I’ll wait. So I’m in the consulates for like 23 hours (it has been a superrrrrrrr long day). So as I’m inside I have to answer a bunch of the same questions \u0026amp apply for his birth certificate \u0026amp passport pic.twitterX3JptPMaJiTo wrap up I go to the hospital get checked out everything is fine.

Our aim throughout these talks has been to protect devolution and make sure laws and policy in areas which are currently devolved remain devolved and this we have achieved.Contrastingly, Mr Russell told MSPs: The effect of the UK government\u0027s latest proposal remains this: the Scottish Parliament\u0027s powers could be restricted without consent.\u0026nbspThis is not something the Scottish Government could recommend the parliament approves.

The model is always for doctors to work closely with parents to agree on the best course of action for the child.In the vast majority of cases an equal decision is made to withdraw treatment and it is rare that there is disagreement. The cases where this is a significant difference in view are the ones that grab the media headlines.
