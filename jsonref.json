He is expected to begin his therapy as soon as he has recovered from his flight.          The fundraising campaign to send Zac to America exceeded its £500,000 targetThe hospital is the leading authority on CAR T-cell therapy, which doctors say will give Zac a 60-80 per cent chance of survival.Zac is believed to be the only child in the UK with the near-haploid strain of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a condition which affects one in 200 childhood sufferers worldwide.His mother and his father, Mark Garbett, launched their fundraising drive after learning that a bone marrow transplant or chemotherapy – the only treatments available to Zac in Britain – had a less than 25 per cent chance of saving him.Yesterday Mr Garbett said: \u0027Zac\u0027s excited about flying because he knows going to America is hopefully how he is going to be able to get better.\u0027It\u0027s been a long slog but now we are just looking forward to the start of Zac\u0027s treatment.\u0027Plumber Mr Garbett, 37, said £630,000 has now been raised, easing worries over how the family would meet ongoing costs in the months of treatment ahead.He added: \u0027We just want to thank everybody once again for their support, both financial and emotional.\u0027It is heart-warming how Zac\u0027s plight has caught people\u0027s attention.

He introduced human frailties in Marvel superheroes such as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk.As the top writer at Marvel Comics and later as its publisher, Lee was widely considered the architect of the contemporary comic book.     Lee and actor Chris Hemsworth arrive at the Los Angeles premiere of Thor at the El Capitan Theatre on May 2, 2011 in Hollywood          Lee (L) and actor Chadwick Boseman at the Los Angeles World Premiere of Marvel Studios\u0027 Black Panther at Dolby Theatre on January 29, 2018 in Hollywood          Actor Robert Downey Jr. (L) and Lee attend The Los Angeles World Premiere of Marvel Studios Doctor Strange in Hollywood, CA on Oct. 20th, 2016          Chris Evans and Stan Lee attend the premiere of Marvel\u0027s \u0027Captain America: Civil War\u0027 in Los Angeles in April 2016He revived the industry in the 1960s by offering the costumes and action craved by younger readers while insisting on sophisticated plots, college-level dialogue, satire, science fiction, even philosophy.Lee hit his stride this decade when he brought the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man and numerous others to life. Lee scripted most of Marvel\u0027s superhero comics himself during the \u002760s, including the Avengers and the X-Men, two of the most enduring. In 1972, he became Marvel\u0027s publisher and editorial director four years later, 72million copies of Spider-Man were sold.Lee also published several books, including \u0027The Superhero Women\u0027 in 1977 and \u0027How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way\u0027 the following year, when he was named publisher of the year by the Periodical and Book Association of America.

He filmed a cameo in every Marvel Studios film, with Venom (pictured above) being the most recent          Lee\u0027s death came just one day after he tweeted a photo of himself in his WWII uniform for Veterans\u0027 Day. He served during the war writing for training films before going back to MarvelCBS turned the Hulk into a successful TV series, with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno portraying the doomed scientist from 1978-82. A Spider-Man series ran briefly in 1978. Both characters were featured in animated TV series as well.The first big-budget movie based on Lee\u0027s characters, \u0027X-Men,\u0027 was a smash in 2000, earning more than $130million at North American theaters. \u0027Spider-Man\u0027 did even better, taking in more than $400million in 2002. A Marvel movie empire would emerge after that, one of the most lucrative mega-franchises in cinema history, with the recent \u0027Avengers: Infinity War\u0027 grossing more than $2billion worldwide. In 10 years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe film shave netted over $17.6billion in worldwide grosses. Born December 28, 1922, in New York, he grew up a fan of \u0027Hardy Boys\u0027 adventure books and Errol Flynn movies, and got a job at Timely Comics after graduating from high school.Within a few months, the editor and art director quit, leaving the 17-year-old Lee with creative control over the company, which grew and was renamed Atlas Comics and, finally, Marvel. Lieber changed his name, thinking Lee would be used for \u0027silly little comics\u0027 and his real name would be reserved for novels.His early work largely reflected popular movies - westerns, crime dramas, romance, whatever was the rage at the time. He worked for about 50 cents per page.After a stint in the Army during World War II, writing for training films, he was back at Marvel to begin a long and admittedly boring run of assembly line comic book production. Lee\u0027s direct influence faded in the 1970s as he gave up some of his editorial duties at Marvel. But with his trademark white mustache and tinted sunglasses, he was the industry\u0027s most recognizable figure. He lectured widely on popular culture.Lee moved to Los Angeles in 1981 to head Marvel Productions, an animation studio that was later purchased, along with Marvel Comics, for $50million by New World Entertainment.As sales of comics declined, Marvel was forced into bankruptcy proceedings that meant it had to void a lifetime contract prohibiting Lee from working for anyone else. Lee later sued Marvel for $10million, saying the company cheated him out of millions in profits from movies based on his characters.In 2000, Lee agreed to write stories for DC Comics, reinventing Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other signature characters for Marvel\u0027s one-time rival. DC Vice President and Publisher Paul Levitz had nothing but praise when the agreement was made.          The creative dynamo, who revolutionized the comic book, has helped make billions for Hollywood by introducing human frailties in Marvel superheroes such as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk. He is pictured on the red carpet in 2004  \u0027With his artistic collaborators at Marvel, Stan co-created the richest imaginary universe a single comics writer has ever built,\u0027 he said.The dapper, friendly comic book genius continued to work into his 90s on numerous projects, including comics, films and DVDs.In the late 1990s, he looked to capitalize on the Internet craze, offering animated \u0027Webisodes\u0027 of comic-like action. Stan Lee Media also sought to reach out to Web-savvy youth through deals with pop artists the Backstreet Boys and Mary J. Blige.The company went bankrupt, and three men were indicted for allegedly defrauding the business in a check kiting scam. Lee wasn\u0027t implicated.After that initial failure, Lee formed the successful Pow!

Our intelligence organisation did not hide anything,\u0027 Erdogan said.\u0027We played them to all who wanted them including the Saudis, the USA, France, Canada, Germany, Britain.\u0027The recordings are really appalling.

We are waiting patiently,\u0027 Erdogan said, adding that the perpetrators of the killing were among 18 suspects detained in Saudi Arabia.\u0027It must be revealed who gave them the order to murder.\u0027  Erdogan has not given details of the contents of the tapes but two sources with knowledge of the issue have told Reuters that Turkey has several audio recordings.They include the killing itself and conversations before the operation which Turkey subsequently uncovered, the sources said. These had led Ankara to conclude from an early stage that the killing was premeditated, despite Saudi Arabia\u0027s initial denials of any knowledge or involvement.Saudi Arabia\u0027s prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb has since said Khashoggi\u0027s killing was planned in advance, although another Saudi official said Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the specific operation.

I hope it would be worth it, but it\u0027s down to iniduals to be responsible for their actions.\u0027But Ann Gerrard, chairwoman of the Bournemouth Beach Hut Association, said: \u0027People do abuse it even though there are signs up informing cyclists of the speed limit. They just absolutely fly by on some parts of the prom.\u0027We have tried to stop people and tell them the speed limit but we just get a lot of verbal abuse.\u0027She added: \u0027It\u0027s an ongoing issue and there have been a lot of near misses, especially with holiday-makers who don\u0027t expect to see cyclists there. Hopefully these signs will be a bit more noticeable and get people to slow down.\u0027          The seven-mile stretch is popular with pedestrians and cyclists but a grandmother and a child have been injured by cyclists in recent yearsChris Saunders, Bournemouth and Poole Tourism\u0027s head of operations, defended the move.He said: \u0027We have installed four digital signs that pick up the speed of passing cyclists and vehicles and advise them of the 10mph limit.\u0027This will change to show \u0027no cycling\u0027 during the cycling ban period. These are vehicle-activated speed signs, exactly the same as you see by the roadside around the country.\u0027Cycling along the promenade is a pleasure that many residents and visitors enjoy and the council actively promote as a safe route to commute and keep fit.\u0027The interactive signs are designed to encourage cyclists and delivery vehicles to slow down and help ensure the promenade is safe for all to use.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/13/11/2E703B1B00000578-6383897-image-a-27_1542109624180.jpg","title":"British couple date Bataclan Paris mark anniversary","story":"    Hanna Corbett and Jack Konda pictured in Paris last year for the memorial to those who were involved in the Bataclan attack in Paris  Hanna and Jack are pictured at Jack\u0027s graduation (left), and in Paris two weeks ago, outside the Louvre museum Both still attend concerts, despite their horrific experience, however they insist on standing close to an exit through fear of the same ever happening again. Hanna and Jack plan to celebrate their milestone with a low-key meal and believe the tragic events \u0027liberated\u0027 them to make the most of the rest of their lives.Hanna, from Harpenden, Herts, said: \u0027It\u0027s hard to put into words but the anniversary brings up everything that you try to push to the back of your mind all year round. \u0027Snowflake\u0027 student union president who threatened to paint...Share this article\u0027We always try to do something for the anniversary.

Both sit on the banks of Loch Ruthven The home is located on the banks of Loch Ruthven, and is currently listed for sale by Strutt and Parker, with offers over £900,000 welcome. Much to the delight of keen fisherman,  the ultimate highland getaway also comes with its own brown trout fishing spot. It also includes a delightful converted steading and a recently renovated cottage, productive pasture, commercial and amenity woodland. Ballachar Steading has been converted from a u-shaped steading to create a very comfortable and welcoming four-bedroom family house with breathtaking views overlooking Loch Ruthven.Adjacent is Spring Cottage, which was derelict until 2016 when it was renovated and transformed into a beautiful and stylish two-bedroom home. This allows significant flexibility it could be used as an annexe or for overflow accommodation or the new owners could live in one and market the other as a holiday let.          Much to the delight of keen fisherman, the ultimate highland getaway also comes with its own brown trout fishing spot          One of the main highlights of the estate is the 0.84-mile frontage along Loch Ruthven and associated riparian fishing rights          The estate extends to approximately 287 acres, including 34 acres of pasture, 81 acres of rough grazings, 86 acres of hill and 81 acres of predominantly ancient woodlandThe loch has some of the finest quality brown trout fishing in Scotland. A traditional wooden clinker rowing boat, moored in its own stone harbour, is included in the sale. The new owner will have the opportunity to be involved in the Loch Ruthven Angling Association, which by agreement does not allow motor boats or bank fishing on the loch.

Paintings are adorned on the green walls which have been fitted with green curtains          Another of the brilliant features in the property includes its large windows which allow residents to look out at the beautiful Scottish countryside, undoubtedly one of the key selling points of the home          The kitchen is clean and comes equip with a washing machine, cooker and fridge. There is plenty of storage space inside the home which would prove useful for dishes, plates, pots and pans          There is a fireplace inside the home which gives it an older, homely feel. The rooms are spacious although the decor could be updated as the sofas inside the property are dated. The walls of the living room are a pale yellow and are in good conditionTwo historic hut circles are situated to the north west of Ballacher Estate. They are eight metres apart and are estimated to be between 1,500 and 4,000 years old. A quote from the ancient monuments website said: \u0027The monument is of national importance because it represents a well-preserved example of housing and farming related to the occupation of the Highlands over the last four millennia.  \u0027It has the rare potential to inform future research into medieval settlement and how life and land-use changed and developed into the post-medieval period.\u0027  Diane Fleming, the agent handling the sale for Strutt \u0026amp Parker, said: \u0027Ballachar is in a fantastic and peaceful setting, while at the same time easily accessible from Inverness. \u0027Its elevated position offers stunning views amongst a truly wonderful natural environment. Both properties are delightfully welcoming and, combined, make a glorious rural retreat. It would suit those looking for a permanent home with an idyllic rural lifestyle or others looking for a Highland holiday home to escape their busy lives.\u0027Tom Amies, who along with his four siblings owns Ballachar, said: \u0027It is a magical setting.\u0027\u0027The silence is extraordinary and it is a very special spot. This place makes you slow down. Different rules apply. As the roads improve, Inverness has got closer and closer but the feeling of seclusion has never changed.\u0027The natural story is fascinating as well. On the estate there are the remains of a village from the Middle Ages and next to it hut circles that may be as much as 4,000 years old.\u0027These are scheduled monuments, and part of Scotland\u0027s ancient history. I stand there and think of the generations that have gone before us. We are not the first people to love this extraordinary part of Scotland and to have chosen it as our home for a time.

Tiltman          This clock had been a gift from Baird and his wife to Taynton upon his marriage and had been engraved especially          Following appearing on television Taynton found his own fame and was often spotted with celebrities \u0027This is the first time this historic collection has been seen in public,\u0027 said auctioneer Chris Ewbank.\u0027The sheer level of detail and the extent of the material shows just how ground-breaking the invention of television was in the 1920s and how William Taynton\u0027s part in it captured the public\u0027s imagination.\u0027It\u0027s astonishing to realise how, when Baird fetched a rather reluctant Taynton from the neighbouring office downstairs for what was, in reality, brief assistance with an experiment, it was to change the young man\u0027s life profoundly forever.\u0027          Taynton has previously recalled his experience with Baird in a television interview broadcast on the BBC in 1965 (above)Police arrest man believed to be killer of Sana MuhammadMeghan Markle appears to be moved by Armistice Day centenary serviceVicky Pattison\u0027s fiancé cosies up to a blonde woman in a clubTerrifying moment thugs attack victim with machetes and hammersLavish wedding saw bride\u0027s dowry packed into £230k worth of bagsHelicopter battles new fire along Simi Valley California highwayAngela Merkel calls for creation of a \u0027real, true European army\u0027Mum shares footage showing aftermath of autistic son\u0027s \u0027meltdown\u0027Moment young girl is forced to apologise after being beaten upTrumpets begin the Festival of Remembrance at Royal Albert HallFurious cyclist unleashes angry rant at pregnant driverTony Bellew\u0027s wife lashes out at arena staff with homophobic tirade    It was said that Taynton (pictured) had made television history when he had stepped in to help Baird at the studio in LondonA few years after his initial television debut William Taynton recalled his experiences in a March 1929 article for Television magazine, where he said Baird had been \u0027excited\u0027 when he had asked for his help.\u0027I remember very clearly how one afternoon while I was working in Mr Cross\u0027s office in Firth Street, Mr Baird, who had his laboratory above us, came running downstairs in a very excited condition, and almost pushed me in front of him into the laboratory and got me to sit in front of his projection lamps. \u0027These were enormous electric bulbs, and gave out a tremendous amount of heat. Behind the lamps there was a whirling disc, and behind that again a quantity of wireless apparatus.          More notes and postcards which were kept in Taynton\u0027s collection. These date back to 1957 and detail the cast members of \u0027This is your life\u0027\u0027After I had sat down Mr Baird went into the next room where the receiving machine was, and left me in front of the lights. Without realising that I was spoiling the experiment, I moved back a little way to avoid the glare and heat. After about five minutes Mr Baird returned, and the moment he saw me he said: \u0027Ah! Why did you go back? – that explains it – you must keep exactly where I put you.\u0027Knowing what was required, Taynton said he knew he had to be still in order for the tranmission to be effective.\u0027I did not move this time, and held on as long as I could. I was just beginning to feel I could not keep still any longer, when I heard a shout from the next room. \u0027Open your mouth.\u0027 I did this, and then was told to turn sideways and this was followed by Mr Baird\u0027s sudden return to the transmitter, saying: \u0027William, I saw you would you like to see what television looks like?\u0027          This book was dated March 1989 and has an article inside which had been cut out from a newspaper. The article was penned by William Taynton himself\u0027Mr Baird seemed very excited, and took me through into the other room, where I looked through a little square opening at the face of a revolving plate. The square seemed covered with a reddish light.\u0027A minute or two later Mr Baird went into the other room, and on a little screen his face immediately appeared. It was not very clear, but by looking closely I could see his eyes and I could see his mouth open and close and recognise that it was Mr Baird himself.\u0027Although I did not realise it at the time, I was the first man in the world whose face had been transmitted by television, and the second man to have seen a televised human face.\u0027          In what seems to be a scrap book of articles, this one from the South Wales Echo and Evening Express was also pasted in and details the \u0027triumph and genius\u0027 of TelevisionHighlights in the sale at Ewbanks are set to include the Bairds\u0027 wedding gift to Taynton, an eight-day Mappin \u0026amp Webb clock from 1941, engraved with the message: To WM Taynton, the 1st person to be seen by television from John L Baird. With Best Wishes for a long and happy marriage July 1941.Items signed by Baird featured in the sale include various books on the subject of television and a 1941 letter from Baird to Taynton.Other letters relate to TV awards, honours and dinners, including one concerning the granting of Honorary Lifetime Associate Membership of the Television Society.          This article was dated as May 10 1980 and was a pictorial article featuring images of Taynton appearing on the TV for the first timeIn 1964, Baird\u0027s wife Margaret presented Taynton with the Baird medallion at the Baird festival, and there are even photographs of Taynton with the actress Raquel Welch cuddling up to him. His fame was to bring him face to face with many such celebrities.There is even a photograph of the inventor Baird with his televisor.Despite having been an accomplished inventor, it hadn\u0027t always been plain sailing for Baird. On his journey inventing the medium of television, he had hit many road blocks and had invested both his time and money in the project.          Taynton had also managed to get his hands on a comic strip which had detailed the day Baird had asked him for help in his Soho studioWhen his family, who had been based in Scotland, discovered the conditions that Baird had been living in, they responded by purchasing £500.00 worth of shares in his company in order to continue to float his ideas.The little known company is now formed and known as Television, Ltd. Baird had a huge cash boost and immediately set about remodelling his apparatus and improving its optical system.The effect of this rendered the transmitted images more sharply than ever before but still with no detail. On the evening of 1st October 1925 Baird then concluded a series of tests using the latest light-sensitive system that he had devised.           A selection of photographs which Taynton had kept hold of will also go on sale of the auction at Ewbank\u0027s in SurreyThe next day  he fitted the device and  overhauled the equipment. Early on this Friday afternoon he placed a rather dilapidated ventriloquist\u0027s doll in front of the screen. On his previous tests the dolls head would come through on the receiving screen as a white blob with three black blobs marking the position of the nose and eyes. But this time the doll appeared as a recognisable image, with shading and detail. The nose, eyes and eyebrows could be distinguished and the top of the head appeared rounded. In his autobiography quoted on Teletronic, Baird described this historic occasion: \u0027The image of the dummy\u0027s head formed itself on the screen with what appeared to be almost unbelievable clarity.\u0027Despite many rare items going up for auction later this month, auctioneer Chris Ewbank has said he doesn\u0027t expect prices to rocket. \u0027Many of the items will be offered without reserve and this is not a sale where we expect prices to rocket.

He became a hate figure for the authorities and eventually fled Czechoslovakia for France in 1975. In 1979, his Czech citizenship was revoked by the government: he became a French citizen two years later. His works – from The Unbearable Lightness of Being to The Book of Laughter and Forgetting – were banned in his homeland until the late 80s.This weekend, Babiš met the novelist and his wife, Vera, in Paris, where Babiš was attending a commemoration of the centenary of the 1918 armistice.According to a post on his Facebook page, Babiš met the Kunderas at their apartment, then spoke with them for three hours at their favourite restaurant. “It was a great honour for me,” Babiš wrote, describing Kundera, who will be 90 next year and is often cited as a contender for the Nobel prize in literature, as a “legend of Czech, French and world literature”.“The conversation was driven by Mrs Kundera, an incredibly energetic lady … I think they deserve the Czech citizenship they lost after emigrating,” he wrote, later telling the Czech CTK news agency – according to Agence France-Presse – that “he really deserves to have his citizenship again”.Babiš said he had invited the Kunderas to visit the Czech Republic, which he said the novelist has not visited for 22 years. Czech reports suggested that Kundera’s response to Babiš was “non-committal”. Babiš said the couple had expressed the hope that the procedure would not require “too much paperwork”.In an interview with the New York Times in 1984, Kundera – who shuns publicity – said that the idea of “home” was “something very ambiguous” for him.“I wonder if our notion of home isn’t, in the end, an illusion, a myth. I wonder if we are not victims of that myth. I wonder if our ideas of having roots – d’être enraciné – is simply a fiction we cling to,” said the novelist, adding that when he emigrated, he had to make the choice, of living “like an émigré in France or like an ordinary person who happens to write books”.“Do I consider my life in France as a replacement, a substitute life, and not a real life? Do I say to myself: ‘Your real life is in Czechoslovakia, among your old countrymen’? … Or do I accept my life in France – here where I really am – as my real life and try to live it fully?

Black Friday originated in the US, where stores open early once a year the day after the Thanksgiving public holiday.Some UK retailers have jumped the gun and released their deals early and others, including Morrisons and Amazon, follow suit this week.Much of the shopping will be done online again, with shoppers preferring to bargain hunt on their phones or laptop at home, rather than queuing up outside shops in the early hours. However, some offers can only be had in stores, for example at Morrisons.It is the first big test for retailers during the peak trading season. According to research by PwC, the average amount consumers are willing to spend on Black Friday has risen steadily over the past two years, from £170 in 2016 to £200 in 2017. Men take a bigger interest than women and also plan to spend more. More often people are buying for themselves rather than Christmas presents.Electronic and technology goods tend to sell best on Black Friday, so for electricals retailers, Black Friday is the new Christmas and has replaced Boxing Day sales. Retailers return to full price in early December before starting their festive promotions just prior to Christmas (this is known as “twin peaks”).Here is the Observer’s handy guide to how to snap up a bargain and stay out of the red.Consumer experts advise shopping around (you can use comparison websites such as idealo or Amazon price tracker Camelcamelcamel), and checking retailers’ returns policies before buying.Here’s what the retailers are offering – we’ll update it as new deals come in.What’s happening? Amazon’s 10-day Black Friday sale starts at midnight on 16 November and runs until 25 November.

The ban is part of Westminster’s 2019-40 development plan released on Monday night, which also included a commitment to build more than 10,000 affordable units by 2040.The size of the average home in the UK has been shrinking in recent years. Homes from the most recent decade have about 67.8 sq metres of living space, according to LABC Warranty, which is not much more than both decks of a London bus, at 55 sq metres. The figure factors in living areas, kitchens and bathrooms, but does not include hallways or staircases.The mega-mansion ban is the latest attempt by Westminster to tackle growing inequality in the borough, where very few people can afford to buy or rent a home on the open market.Earlier this year, the council blocked a plan to create a 1,580 sq metre, £40m home in a Grade I listed terrace overlooking Regent’s Park, telling the developer to “wake up” to the housing crisis.Westminster city council’s Richard Beddoe said: “We want Westminster to be home to thriving, mixed communities, not empty super-prime properties. That’s why we will be restricting the size of new luxury apartments and introducing a new extra bedroom policy to make it easier for families to extend their homes so they have enough space to stay living in Westminster and are not forced to move out.“Building the right type of homes for people to live in is priority number one in our city plan. There’s a national crisis and we have to play our part in fixing that, not just for the benefit of UK as a whole, but for the real people who have legitimate aspirations to build their lives and grow up with their families in our city.”Henry Pryor, an independent luxury-property buying agent, said: “At last there’s a chance that we may get some truly affordable housing in Westminster. While this change will be met by a wailing and gnashing of teeth amongst developers and estate agents there has to be a chance that mere mortals will be able to dream of living in zone 1. An overcdue and welcome development. Two cheers for Westminster council. A pity that they didn’t make a start on this a decade ago.” The proposals are subject to six weeks’ consultation. The ban would not apply to homes that had been split up into flats and were being converted back into a single family house.Westminster has already introduced tight restrictions on homeowners digging large basements to create so-called “iceberg homes” with several underground storeys used for gyms, cinemas, swimming pools and car garages.The council said Westminster’s median house price of £1.05m meant it was very difficult for anyone on even very large salaries to be able to buy their own home in the borough. “The average household income in Westminster is £52,199, yet the median house price was £1,054,400 in 2017,” the council said. “That’s nearly two times higher than London as a whole, and almost five times higher than that of the UK.”Those asked to consider making an extra contribution include the residents of the Candy brothers’ luxurious One Hyde Park apartment complex in Knightsbridge and those living in hundreds of multimillion-pound mansions in Mayfair, Belgravia and Maida Vale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/135b527134196470c2a87d5531863145249361b3/0_323_6327_3797/master/6327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9728f93699e5c8170bfc8dc739dcedee","title":"troll media trans emile ratelband lgbt","story":"Emile Ratelband is following a sad tradition of men pulling presposterous stunts to undermine the LGBT community. He should not be humouredLast week, Stonewall published a report that found that more than one in 10 trans people have attempted to take their own lives in the past year, and nearly half of all trans people have considered it. This indicates a mental health crisis that is at epidemic levels within the trans community, so I’d say it’s a good thing that many countries have decided to take small measures to make it a little easier for trans people to be true to their gender identities.And yet, as the stage invasion during Britain’s performance at this year’s Eurovision demonstrates: when something nice happens, there’s always some bore determined to ruin it. In May, the bore in question was David Lewis – a man who claimed to be “a woman on Wednesdays”, and who tried to become a Labour women’s officer to object to the party’s trans-inclusive policies. This month, that role of bore has been taken up by one Emile Ratelband, a Dutch man who has petitioned the courts to allow him to identify as 20 years younger than his age of 69, on the grounds – among other things – that it would yield him more matches on Tinder. Ratelband told the Washington Post: “We can make our own decisions if we want to change our name, or if we want to change our gender. So I want to change my age.” Thus suggesting that gender is a matter of choice.These cases are but two in a rather sad tradition of men pursuing frivolous lawsuits that undermine LGBT rights: in March of this year, the anti-LGBT activist Chris Sevier attempted to marry his laptop in protest against the introduction of equal marriage in Utah (the case was dismissed on the grounds that the laptop was not legally old enough). That the phenomenon of the male egomaniac remains a fact of life is unfortunate. And one of the downsides of attempting to maintain a free society is that preposterous stunts such as these must occasionally be indulged in public courts. And yet it is frustrating that the British media has leapt upon Ratelband’s shenanigans as though they are newsworthy, describing him straightforwardly as a “pensioner”, taking his justifications at face value.Instead, the hot take machine has been duly cranked up, and producers have been soliciting pundits to appear on the airwaves to debate whether changing one’s age is in fact the same as changing one’s gender. Even a cursory Googling reveals that one premise of Ratelband’s decision is nonsense: people are already able to conceal their ages on Tinder simply by upgrading to a paid version – a much cheaper and more discreet solution than a lawsuit that makes international headlines. But, of course, worldwide brouhaha was the entire point of this silly exercise, as Ratelband is in fact one of the Netherlands’ most notorious trolls – as Dutch social media users have desperately been trying to tell anyone who will listen.Why has this attention-seeker been described in most UK news reports as simply a “pensioner”? And why are trans people, yet again, being forced into the position of defending the meagre law changes that have been made to safeguard their mental and physical health? As Shon Faye, a writer and columnist who is trans (and, disclaimer, my friend) put it to a producer who asked her to respond to this story: “Interesting how there’s never time to discuss what might be factors at play in the extreme mental health crisis in my community but always time for nonsense.”If only it were possible to conclude that Ratelband has consummately humiliated himself on the international stage, but the truth is he’s played a blinder. He knew exactly how to put on this ludicrous little melodrama, and the media has played its expected part with aplomb. It would be funny if an already marginalised group of people didn’t have to suffer as a result. Trans people deserve better than this. I dare say we all do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb50c16d9de78558d9f423f24fc331ad0eb2ee49/0_98_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d40a28b712f85505830a0c7b59a86fd","title":"uk withdrawal unesco historical cultural vandalism emily thornberry","story":"In 1985, a young MP – only two years in the job – stood up in the House of Commons to oppose the government’s plans to withdraw from Unesco, the UN agency created after the second world war to encourage global development and collaboration in the fields of education, culture and science. Responding to the Thatcher government citing Unesco’s bureaucratic and budgetary problems, he said: “The basis of this debate is not the finances or the administrative arrangements of Unesco, but the power of the far right in the United States.”That was Jeremy Corbyn, the only Labour MP who took part in that debate who is still standing in the House of Commons today, and not for the first or last time standing on the right side of history. But now, history is repeating itself, with the news that Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, plans to follow the recent lead of Donald Trump and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu by once again withdrawing the UK from Unesco, 21 years after Robin Cook restored our country’s membership.As in 1985, she is blaming the agency’s budgetary problems, but – again, just like then – it is nothing but a smokescreen for the Tories’ shameful obsession with pleasing this US president. When the Trump administration announced its withdrawal from Unesco jointly with Netanyahu’s last year, it was explicit about the supposed “anti-Israel bias” that had driven its decision, by which it meant Unesco’s temerity in accepting the overwhelming vote of its members in 2011 to admit the state of Palestine as a full member. For Mordaunt to blame concerns over Unesco’s finances instead is not only to take the public for fools but also a surprisingly cowardly move for a minister who is usually willing to speak her mind.In doing so, however, she has contradicted herself. Only nine months ago, she praised Unesco’s new director-general, Audrey Azoulay, as being “very focused on the reform agenda”, and reassured her that “we will support her” in the “tough job” ahead. What has changed in nine months? And what has changed since, only last month, Matthew Lodge, the UK’s ambassador to Unesco reassured his colleagues of the UK government’s view that “although challenges remain, Unesco’s finances are on a sounder footing. The political disputes that have plagued this organisation for too long have been de-escalated and there is a renewed sense of optimism for the future.” Four weeks on, the same government proposes to walk away.And let us be clear what we are walking away from: the UN agency that – among many other things – is responsible for driving up literacy rates across the globe, promoting gender equality in education, protecting press freedom, coordinating tsunami warnings, and preserving more than 1,000 of the world’s most important heritage sites, including 31 here in Britain.But even more than that, we are walking away from our own heritage. It was British politicians such as Rab Butler who helped develop the concept of Unesco, a conference in London in 1945 that framed its constitution, a British scientist who became its first director-general, and a Labour prime minister – Clement Attlee – who came up with the words that summed up its mission. “Since wars begin in the minds of men,” he wrote in the preamble to the new agency’s constitution, “it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed.”That was the thinking of a generation shattered by the second world war, desperate to create the global institutions that would not just prevent any repeat but for ever stop the nationalist forces of hatred, ision and prejudice from rising again. Unesco can rightly be claimed as one of Britain’s greatest contributions to that global architecture of peace, and for Penny Mordaunt to be willing to destroy that legacy by withdrawing Britain’s membership is nothing but historical and cultural vandalism.If her financial excuses were the true reason, we might just bemoan the penny-pinching and short-sightedness. But, as Jeremy Corbyn argued 33 years ago, and as the UK’s ambassador to Unesco confirmed last November, those excuses hold no water. Britain makes a net gain from our membership of Unesco: we contributed £11m to the agency this year, versus £100m value added to our economy from its designation of our heritage sites.No, the truth is more profound and more depressing. Just as in 1985, we have a Tory government that is slavishly following America down a path to isolationism, and an ever-increasing detachment from the institutions that should govern the globe.And if it will not listen to the Labour party, it should perhaps listen to the last truly internationalist Tory prime minister, who spoke in that same debate as Jeremy Corbyn in 1985, and who would be turning in his grave at the shame of his successors today. In the Unesco decision, Ted Heath saw: “the growth of a nasty, narrow-minded nationalism, which believes that we can survive without the rest of the world and, in its more arrogant form, that we can just tell the rest of the world what it should do. We think that we can tell the rest of the world, “Do what we say, or else we go”, implying that our loss is so great that they are bound to do what we say.“In the modern world,” he concluded, “nothing could be further from the truth.” How right he was. And we can only ask why the Tory party still will not listen.• Emily Thornberry is the shadow foreign secretary"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/239f55e1689837a4789c779ed3c37ac1c44e5d50/380_155_4852_2911/master/4852.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1479297899e1e19ac4291b49753aca95","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of snug","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘snug’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘snug’ (please note that these are no longer published online).

Year 2 pupils will also have compulsory national tests until 2023.Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said the multiplication check would be simple to use for both schools and pupils.“Leaving primary school with a fundamental grasp of basic numeracy is as important as leaving being able to read. And just as the phonics check has helped more children learn to read, this will ensure more pupils know their times tables,” Gibb said.The test has been opposed by teaching unions, who argue that times tables are already being taught and assessed throughout a pupil’s time at primary school.“An extra national test isn’t going to tell teachers, parents or children anything they don’t already know, and it won’t improve times tables knowledge,” said Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers.“In reality, this is just another test for primary schoolchildren. Calling it a check doesn’t change this. Children and teachers will still have time taken away from their teaching and learning to take and administer these tests and the results will be used by Ofsted to hold schools to account.”Whiteman said the estimated £5m it will cost to hold the check could be better spent elsewhere within schools.Mike Ellicock, chief executive of National Numeracy – a charity that campaigns to help raise low levels of numeracy in the UK – cautioned that the check could be counter-productive if it led to increased anxiety.“Times tables have their place. It is important that everyone knows some number facts, so that we can use numbers practically in daily life,” he said.“However, our recent data shows that, compared with any other age group, immediate school leavers have the highest level of anxiety about maths. So we need to ensure that we are building confidence rather than destroying it.”The DfE said schools in England would be able to benchmark themselves against published regional and national results, while also using inidual pupil scores to provide extra support to those who require it.The 25 questions will be tilted towards the six-, seven-, eight-, nine- and 12-times tables, “because these have been determined to be the most difficult multiplication tables”, according to the DfE’s framework. The six-second time limit was decided after pilot tests were run in primary schools earlier this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84f58c41ee15f2598593230025a1c01ed19a589e/0_4_4365_2619/master/4365.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c35de2c6c523ff55ad8b2a704551d73","title":"tell us what impact is private tuition having on education","story":"We’d like to find out from parents, teachers, students – and tutors about why private tuition is on the rise.

The scientists behind the findings said there could also be some relevance for humans: the sperm counts of western men have halved in the last 40 years.Insects are such an integral part of life, as pollinators and prey, that scientists say their decline could lead to “ecological Armageddon”. Little is known about the precise causes of the decline, though climate change, habitat destruction and global use of pesticides are considered probable factors.The research, published in the Nature Communications journal, found that exposing beetles to a five-day heatwave in the laboratory reduced sperm production by three-quarters females were unaffected.“Beetles are thought to constitute a quarter of bioersity, so these results are very important for understanding how species react to climate change,” said Kris Sales, at the University of East Anglia, who led the work.Other research has shown that heat can damage male reproduction in humans as well as cows, sheep and other mammals.“There could be relevance for human fertility,” said Prof Matt Gage, co-leader of the UEA research group. “The paradox is that one of the reasons the climate is warming up and we are having more heatwaves is there are too many humans. So maybe this is a leveller.”Stuart Wigby, of the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study, said: “Given what we already know about the generality of the sensitivity of sperm to heat, there is every reason to expect that similar effects would be seen in other insects and also in mammals including humans.”The red flour beetle used in the experiments is a tropical species that thrives at 35C. When exposed to temperatures of 5C and 7C higher, male fertility plummeted. While these were high temperatures, 90 countries had experienced them in recent years, said Gage.Sales added: “Insects in nature are likely to experience multiple heatwave events, which could become a problem for population productivity if male reproduction cannot adapt or recover.”Further experiments are under way to find out whether the beetles can adapt to heat shocks and to examine how other species, such as butterflies, cope with raised temperatures.How the heat damages the sperm is not fully understood, though the researchers noticed damage to sperm membranes. It is likely that the DNA in the sperm is also damaged, meaning harm can be passed to offspring. Most warm-blooded male animals protect sperm from excessive heat by having testes outside the body, leaving them several degrees cooler.Wigby said the understanding of factors that reduced male fertility was poor. “So any studies that add to our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying variation in male fertility is valuable. Showing that the harm can occur in a heatwave-like scenario is new and important, as is the demonstration of transgenerational effects. However, the applicability to the real world is always an issue for lab studies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69e27cc2d82d8b5fd3e283a6f4765858b11c4fbb/3_46_1538_923/master/1538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cddf26eb280d8303c250b1cbf8b6eace","title":"amazing grace review aretha franklin documentary","story":"The queen of soul didn’t want this film of a two-night recording session in a Baptist church to be seen – but it’s a spine-tingling sensationIn 1972, following a string of hits and Grammy awards, Aretha Franklin decided her next project would be a return to her roots. The daughter of a Detroit preacher, Franklin secured a Baptist church in Los Angeles for a two-night recording session, and the result was Amazing Grace, her most successful album and the top-selling gospel recording of all time.Warner Bros Records hired Sydney Pollack to shoot the process, looking for a mix between a concert film and a making-of. Pollack had just directed They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? and had already wrapped production on Jeremiah Johnson. While this is hard to believe, the two-night production at the New Temple Missionary Baptist church resulted in useless footage. The crew neglected to slate the shots with clapperboards, necessary for synchronising sound and image – a mind-boggling omission and one reason why Amazing Grace is only making its debut in 2018.After Pollack died in 2008, music producer Alan Elliot remedied the audio-visual issue using modern editing tools. The film was set to be screened at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals in 2015, but a last-minute injunction by Franklin herself stopped it: her reasons remain a mystery. Now, however, three months after her death, the movie is ready for its one-week qualifying run for an Academy award. Clearly there are ethical questions about watching a film that the subject didn’t want you to see. And we can quibble as to whether Pollack, Elliot or credited editor Jeff Buchanan is the true author of the piece. But this is all secondary to the fact that Amazing Grace is, without a doubt, one of the finest music documentaries ever. For close to 90 minutes I sat with chills up and down my spine in a near-constant roll. Franklin singing gospel in a badly lit church with rows of cheap movie theatre seats filled with ecstatic fans is a balm for the spirit, and something that needs to be seen.The film is almost wall-to-wall music, with Franklin barely acknowledging the audience between songs. The musical director is the affable Rev James Cleveland, who also sings and plays piano. The Southern California Community Choir, decked out in shiny silver vests, is led by its enthusiastic conductor the Rev Alexander Hamilton. The remainder of the group include top session men, such as Bernard “Pretty” Purdie on drums and Chuck Rainey on bass. But this isn’t a studio, it’s a church loaded with sound gear and a team of cameramen buzzing around. Cleveland at one point offers up an “amen” to the cessation of technical difficulties.It’s unclear to what extent Pollack dressed the set. A huge painting of a rather muscular Christ emerging from his baptism hangs behind the choir to the side there’s an American flag. Everyone is sweating under the hot lights, especially Aretha who stands not under a spotlight, but behind a pulpit: she isn’t performing, she is testifying.The song selection is a mix of traditional gospel tunes plus a little Marvin Gaye and Carole King. At the halfway mark comes an astounding rendition of Amazing Grace that is stretched out to nearly 11 minutes. The camera moves across the faces of the choir, who are first to leap to their feet in support. Then the audience, then Cleveland, who moves from teary to full-on sobbing. By the end of the song the entire church is a mess, but somehow Aretha keeps it together and hits each note perfectly.Franklin lets Cleveland do the talking for her on night one, but on night two there’s a visit from her father, who doesn’t just give a touching speech, he comes up to mop her brow when the sweat gets too much.Also in the crowd on night two are Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts, who were in Los Angeles finishing the Stones’ career highlight Exile on Main St, and there is no doubt that the gospel inflections of songs such as Shine a Light and Let It Loose were inspired by this visit.Four decades on, Amazing Grace offers an abundance of time-capsule treasures – the clothing, the dancing, the very visible camera gear. Pollack skitters around, pointing at members of the crowd with a “shoot that” urgency to members of his camera crew. There are also noticeable racial inequalities that wouldn’t be quite as stark today. The entire crew is white, the audience almost entirely black. The vibe of the film exudes positivity, but there is an inevitable optic of ethnography with a setup like that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96886096e9accb6c463045a2f6e0424a9cb1fb30/377_1460_4234_2539/master/4234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ebf8af704144415bcab1fdf094c69b2","title":"nigel slater fennel with cream and pine kernels recipe","story":"Scrumptious creamy veg with a crunchy crustTrim 750g of fennel, then slice into pieces no thicker than a pencil.

Remove from the heat and pour over 250ml of double cream.Tear up 45g of fresh white bread and place in the bowl of a food processor. Add 10g of parsley leaves, the grated zest of an orange, a little salt and black pepper, and 25g of pine kernels. Process briefly to give a rough-textured crumb mixture.Scatter the seasoned breadcrumb mixture over the surface of the cream. Trickle a little olive oil over the crumbs. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the cream is bubbling around the edges.Fennel tends to become bitter when browned too enthusiastically, so take care to let it colour only lightly, with just the edges turning pale gold, before adding the cream.Celeriac likes this treatment, too, as does kholrabi and celery. Keep the slices quite thin. Add rosemary to the crumbs or chopped dill (in the case of kohlrabi). I like these both as a principal dish or an accompaniment, but they are equally good simply spooned over thick toast.

For the first time, girls playing in playgrounds and schools, no matter the obstacles they may face, can see a pathway to a career in the game. The quality of the product is getting better and better. With Women’s Super League players not needing a job to make ends meet, technical and fitness levels are only going to continue to improve.But how stable are the foundations of this restructured pyramid which marks a new era for the domestic game? What are the commercial prospects? And what is needed to steady the ship?Women’s teams at the top are overwhelmingly reliant on the financial support of their parent clubs, and the majority have operating losses which range from Manchester City’s £746,000 in the 13 months to 30 June 2017, to Liverpool’s £71,236 for the year ending 31 May 2017, according to their accounts.Of the 11 teams in the WSL, nine have accounts registered with Companies House and only Everton and Birmingham made profits in the financial year ending May and June 2017 respectively – and those were small.There are lots of anomalies from club to club. Arsenal Women, for example, received £1,592,000 from their parent company, which waived the right to reimbursement, and had a £265,000 operating loss in the most recent financial year. Unlike at most other clubs, all their staff were paid and employed by the parent company.Despite the discrepancies, the figures that exist do not paint a pretty picture. However, they have to be taken with a pinch of salt, not least because it is not uncommon for football clubs to operate with a loss.Time moves quickly in football, and perhaps even more quickly in women’s football. The women’s pyramid has faced changes year on year, from league sizes to the switch to a winter schedule, and has lacked stability.Accounts ending this year, still before the restructure, may well look very different to those that ended in 2017. The move to the winter season has affected attendances and means match-day revenue will have fallen on average but commercial interest has been on the rise.The financial implications of the restructure will be evident only when accounts covering this season are published. In applying to be in the WSL clubs had to submit “detailed marketing and commercial plans to support an increase in match-day attendances and income generation”, as well as supply a forecast for the next four years. The arrival of Manchester United on the scene with a rumoured investment of £5m will also shake things up.Funding from the Football Association has increased to £120,000 for WSL clubs and £61,500 for Championship clubs.Women’s sport generally is increasingly attractive to companies for a number of reasons. It is an untapped market with the potential for rapid growth, relatively low investment can reap big rewards and women’s sport is seen as cleaner, fairer and better for a company’s image.The FA has been vocal about its wish to find a sponsor for the leagues, with the new head of the women’s professional game, Kelly Simmons, stating it as a key aim.Both domestic cup competitions in England have sponsorship deals, the energy company SSE with the FA Cup since 2015 and Continental Tyres with the League Cup since 2011. The national team benefit from partnerships with Continental Tyres, Nike and Vauxhall, plus more recent deals involving Disney and Mars.The cosmetics company Avon became the first company to sign an independent shirt sponsorship deal with a WSL team when it announced a three-year partnership with Liverpool in 2017. In recent months Barcelona have unveiled a similar link-up with the tool company Stanley Black \u0026amp Decker. BPI sponsors Portugal’s women’s team alongside the men’s and has become the named sponsor of women’s league as part of a new agreement with the Portuguese FA.Low and falling attendances pose two problems. First, cripplingly low crowds hold down match-day revenue, which should be one of a club’s biggest financial assets and, second, sponsors and commercial partners will stay interested only if the audience keeps growing. Partners seem willing to bank on the potential of the sport but that will not last forever.Although the restructure promises to shake things up, expecting a dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of club finances could be premature. The criteria on which clubs were admitted to the top two isions, and the vigorousness with which their applications were tested, have been called into question. Having been successful in bids to remain in the Women’s Championship, last year’s champions Doncaster Rovers Belles, and Sheffield FC, pulled out of the league citing the demanding financial commitments.Their slide into the third tier follows that of Oxford United and Watford, Sunderland’s fall two isions from the WSL and the collapse of Notts County on the eve of the 2017 Spring Series.Clubs’ finances teeter on the edge, tied to the financial stability and philanthropy of their parent companies. Whether the financial effects of the FA’s restructure of the women’s pyramid will have a positive or negative effect will take time to show. What is clear is that the unsure and haphazard starting point means that a significant increase in support from parent clubs and an increase in sponsorship are vital for the short- and medium-term future of professional women’s football.• Arsenal have signed Janni Arnth from the 2017 Swedish champions Linköpings. The Danish defender has 78 caps and comes into an unbeaten Arsenal having endured a disappointing season with Linköping.• Chelsea have been drawn in the Champions League quarter-finals to face 2017 finalists PSG. Wolfsburg play Lyon over two legs in a rematch of the 2018 final, which the French club wonafter extra-time. Slavia Prague face Bayern Munich and Barcelona play Norway’s LSK Kvinner.• Everton have announced the departure of manager Andy Spence following defeat by Yeovil, who won their first game in the WSL since their promotion in 2016.

The second was at least as hardRecently a colleague asked me what it was like growing up gay in Arkansas. Even I was surprised to find I didn’t have an answer. After all, I should be an expert on that subject – and, indeed, a couple of horror stories she no doubt expected to hear are true.However, as an adolescent, my sexual orientation, dormant as I kept it, wasn’t the reason I felt queer. Right after I hit puberty, my mother and I moved to a university town from a small farm community to escape the aftermath of my parents’ orce, and in the years that followed she had to work too many hours at too many jobs for too little money to make ends meet. Periodically she entered a depression and I, in an attempt to prevent it, strove to be perfect.Though I developed many deep friendships at college, the fact of the matter was that I had a set of concerns quite different from those of nearly all my peers. They worried about flawless GPAs and gradations of the Greek system and whether or not their parents would bankroll tropical breaks. I worried about my mom’s financial and emotional survival and how I was going to get to and from Arkansas and whether or not I could find an internship that would simply pay.It wasn’t until later that I would worry about the balance and exorbitant interest rate of the credit card I had just gotten, because for now it was a relief to be able to buy dinner off-campus or a shirt on clearance without having to do mental math to make certain I could afford it.To further complicate my situation, being the first person in my family to eventually finish college, and one of only a few of us to leave Arkansas, I had now transformed myself into an alien among even my own people.For years there were these more urgent obstacles of class to navigate before I could afford the luxury of parsing my sexuality. Now that I’m a writer, now that I’m a professor, now that I’m 37 and still happily single – the fact that I’m gay is one of the least queer things about me.Because I believe in the importance of representation of minorities in the classroom, and because one’s sexual orientation typically isn’t apparent, as a senior lecturer now at Vanderbilt University – the same institution I attended as an undergraduate – I often wonder if I should come out to my students at the beginning of each semester.I envy my LGBT colleagues who are married or otherwise partnered and thus set to reveal this aspect of their identities organically – for example, by simply mentioning what they did over break and with whom. My own necessarily unprompted coming-out, as a single man, probably would land with all the awkwardness of a revelatory sit-down with Mom and Dad, which I never had with my parents.Recently, though, I realized the same need for representation in the classroom of first-generation college students – representation of those of us from the working class. A year ago, in conjunction with the university’s office for equity, ersity and inclusion, I met with a contingent of Vanderbilt’s faculty members, administrators and the president of the student body – all of us first-generation college graduates – to discuss how the university might better serve its own first-generation students, who across the country have higher rates of stress and depression, and lower rates of retention, than their peers.What I was most surprised to learn in that meeting was that nearly everyone present reported that their working-class status had had a greater impact on their experience as undergraduates – for some of them, on their entire lives – than did any other aspect of their identity, including race, gender and sexual orientation.How best then, for those of us who’ve risen from poverty to positions of power and influence, positions of financial stability, to help our younger counterparts, those who are struggling to rise themselves? We should make ourselves seen and heard. We should stand before low-income students as concrete examples of where they might go and whom they might become and what they might be. We should come out to them as working class.I only wish I had started making such bold declarations sooner. If I had, I would have learned in college that I wasn’t alone, that there were other students like me, with my particular concerns – more of them than I imagined. It wasn’t until I started writing about my life that I realized there had been some working-class backgrounds even among my friends. But much in the same way as it was when I was a closeted teen, the latent fear of being perceived as outside the norm – of never being the best simply because of who I am and will never be able to stop being – prevented me from seeing and speaking this truth, too. It prevented me from speaking it even to myself.When I come out to my students and colleagues as from the working class, I want to expand the idea of who or what a professor is, and I especially hope to give upwardly mobile students – those incarnations of my younger self – the example and language to find one another. To see one another. To be better known to themselves.Today I can’t help imagining: what if there had been someone at my mother’s tiny, rural high school, where there was no college counselor, no one to expose the children of sharecroppers to options after graduation beyond working on a farm or in a factory – what if there had been someone like me, to tell my mother she reminded me of me? To ask her, have you thought about college? Don’t worry, I’d say, you’re good enough. Don’t worry, there’s financial aid. Don’t worry, I’d reassure her, you’ll belong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":null,"title":"support the guardian how to make the most","story":"Over one million of our readers have supported us financially, and there are a number of advantages to doing so – including getting closer to our journalists and reducing the number of requests you see on our articles supporters help us keep our journalism open for everyone through regular financial contributions, or one-off payments.

She saw Steve Reich live and would attend hog-roast gatherings under the Brooklyn Bridge hosted by the artist Gordon Matta-Clark set to a live soundtrack by Philip Glass (known to the family as Phil). Aged eight, she was delivering performance pieces at the Kitchen, a downtown arts space by 12, she was the leader of the post-punk band Chandra.Chandra – the band – were steeped in New York’s prolific post-punk, funk and no wave scenes, but until recently their music was largely forgotten. Even Soul Jazz Records’ comprehensive two-volume New York Noise compilation found no room for it. But a new reissue, along with forthcoming live shows, is bringing Chandra’s story back into focus. “I thought it would be three years before I picked up this music again,” says Oppenheim, now 50. “But it’s been more like three decades.”Oppenheim is the daughter of the late conceptual artist Dennis Oppenheim, who often included her in his work – her first drawing became the basis for a piece. Once, she held a limp, lifeless puppet with a knife in its back in her outstretched arms, while staring malevolently into the camera, for a series on puppets. “On one project my dad said, ‘They are going to shoot you’, meaning photograph me, but I took it very literally – the artist taking my photo had actually shot himself in the arm previously for an art piece.”This became the norm. “I was surrounded by it from day one,” she says. “It takes a long time to catch on that you’re living an unconventional life.” Oppenheim’s parents split when she was five. Dad’s house was filled with the music of Devo, Patti Smith and Lou Reed. At the house of her mum, Phyllis Jalbert, she’d stand on the coffee table and sing along to Janis Joplin.Encouraged by the creative freedom her parents offered her, Oppenheim soon outgrew assisting her father. “By seven, I was the artist and he was supporting me,” she says. Her performance art pieces at places such as the Kitchen and Franklin Furnace, a hole in the wall avant-garde venue, were an evolution of her childhood. “I had become infused with my father’s sensibility,” she recalls. One piece featured her and a friend tossing their babies into trash cans there was a song about climbing out of high-rise windows. During this era at the Kitchen, the music director was the cult disco artist Arthur Russell, who booked bands including Talking Heads and the Modern Lovers – although Oppenheim’s attentions were focused elsewhere. “I just remember running around and making tunnels to crawl through from these old grey cushions.”Chandra formed when Eugenie Diserio and Steven Alexander saw Oppenheim perform and decided they wanted to work with her. They were contemporaries of her parents, former members of Model Citizens (who had been produced by John Cale) and played in no-wave band the Dance.“Chandra was completely unique,” Alexander remembers. “We wanted to create a project around her. It wasn’t just about working with a kid.” Oppenheim saw no problem: “It felt normal to be in an adult world and treated equally. I felt like an adult to a fault. I probably missed out on more fundamental kid-like experiences but that’s where I wanted to be.”Oppenheim was 11 in 1979, when Chandra rented a room in the Music Building in Hell’s Kitchen. “A grungy, gritty, rough place,” she remembers. They practised twice a week with Fred Maher joining on drums. Some days they would bump into Madonna. Oppenheim’s songwriting quickly evolved, Alexander recalls: “Chandra would blow us away with her lyrics. We were always like, ‘Don’t change a thing.’”The deceptively simple Kate, written about Oppenheim’s best friend, begins: “There’s a girl called Kate and she thinks she’s really great but she’s not.” The account of childhood jealousy moves from envy to empathy, telling a story from two opposing perspectives. Oppenheim squeezed in writing wherever she could: Kate was written on her paediatrician’s examination table while she waited for her appointment.In 1980 the band recorded the EP Transportation. Full of looping bass lines, spiky guitars, wheezing melodica and fizzy drum bursts – akin to ESG and Lizzy Mercier Descloux – these ornery textures were elevated by Oppenheim’s unique delivery. Her vocals were youthful, yet on tracks such as Concentration the manipulative and experimental shifts in tone and delivery sound way beyond her years. “It was very different to a lot of the aggressive no-wave stuff of the time,” Alexander recalls. “It had a meditative quality.”The band gave their debut show at New York’s legendary Mudd Club, a favourite hangout of Lou Reed, Debbie Harry and Johnny Thunders. There were more packed shows and great press in the New York Times and NME. “There were moments when the music was pulsing and Chandra was chanting, in a room full of jaded hipsters, and they’d be staring with their jaw open,” says Alexander. “It was so pure.” Oppenheim says: “I was more comfortable on stage than I was anywhere else in my life.”Oppenheim was shielded from many of the more unsavoury elements of band life. “We were protective of her,” Diserio recalls. “Everybody was always on their best behaviour backstage. We just wanted her to have an outlet.” Oppenheim recalls her mother kicking out a Paris Match photographer who requested she be “scantily clad and pose in a suggestive way” for a photoshoot.A second incarnation of the band called the Chandra Dimension was created in 1981 by Alexander and Diserio. While the pair remained in the band, they brought in three younger players aged between 12 and 19. They didn’t really gel, shelving a second EP. Plus homework got in the way. “I had to make a decision, school or music, and I chose school,” says Oppenheim.Oppenheim figured Chandra’s reputation would allow her to start new projects after finishing school but the interest wasn’t there. She moved into real estate but never stopped making music. “It was incredibly difficult and discouraging,” she says. “To have a life in music within my grasp and then it was gone. I never stopped making music but I no longer had an audience.”A limited vinyl reissue in 2008 via Cantor Records created a new one. The film director Matt Wolf, who had directed a documentary on Arthur Russell, included Kate on the soundtrack to his 2013 documentary Teenage, which was scored by Deerhunter’s Bradford Cox. A year later, offers to reform Chandra came in, which Oppenheim accepted: by 2016 she was performing live with the Avalanches in New York after they sampled the track Subways on their comeback album Wildflower.She continues to tour the music of Chandra with new band members. Schedule permitting, her 11-year-old daughter sometimes performs with them. “She’s the age I was when I was making this music so it adds a strange time warp experience,” says Oppenheim. “She looks so similar to me, it’s like staring at the record cover from 1980.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166f65a62cd64034126de9ddf6182115c9cfdb13/0_104_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7ff992059f6fd3e61120812f865613","title":"arron banks man who bankrolled brexit podcast today in focus","story":"Carole Cadwalladr has been covering the biggest pro-leave donor for nearly two years.

Contingency measures in narrowly defined areas may, exceptionally, be needed in order to protect the interests and the integrity of the EU.”No 10 has indicated that progress has been made in the Brexit talks over the last 24 hours, although there is not yet a final text that is ready to be put in front of senior ministers for approval.The prime minister’s official spokesman told reporters at a morning briefing that “there are a small number of outstanding issues as the UK pushes for the best text that can be negotiated”.Earlier the Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, had said a draft deal might still be reached by Wednesday evening, but that such progress was “not at all definite”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/274131bbbb71cd20ace8cfc234c74d40c74758b9/0_177_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a0c540160b873bfeaa3e007febf529b","title":"how to avoid losing your memory in the digital age","story":"Alex Mullen has an extraordinary talent: after just 16 seconds of flicking through a pack of cards, he can recall their exact order. The 26-year-old medical student began using memory techniques to help with his university degree, but he picked them up so quickly that soon he was entering competitions, eventually becoming the International Association of Memory world champion in 2015. At the championships, which take place again this December, “memory athletes” compete to remember the most in the shortest time, in categories that include card sequences, names, faces and dates of historic events.“My first world championships win was very surreal. I was training hard, but winning was never really on my radar,” Mullen says. “When I won by literally one second, on the tenth and final event, I didn’t really process it.” Yet he went on to win the championships again in 2017, is ranked No 1 in the world and holds multiple records for his recall skills.People like Mullen raise important questions in a world where digital databases, whose powers of retention are far greater than our own, are increasingly standing in for human memories. If we no longer need to keep a mental note of facts, figures or dates, might we lose our ability to retain information?We know that the brain is malleable. A study in 2000 showed that the hippocampus, a region of the brain that plays an important role in memory, was larger in London cab drivers than in the wider public, perhaps because they had to learn and retain the “knowledge” – the quickest routes through the capital’s streets.Emma Ward, a senior lecturer in psychology at Middlesex University, says that the internet hasn’t been an integral part of our lives for long enough for scientists to fully comprehend its long-term effect on people’s brains. She adds: “There is evidence that memory training is beneficial – and the very idea behind this is practice and rehearsal, so that neural pathways become strengthened.“One may argue that the more we become reliant on memory aids and technology as reminders, the less efficient our memory processes become. It will be interesting, in years to come, to examine children who grew up with such available technology, to see the effect it has upon memory and cognition.”Dean Burnett, a neuroscientist and author, believes that memory needs to be exercised. “It is a biological function, like most others, and so not using it would mean it’s less robust and less reliable than in someone who uses it often,” he says. “Memories are essentially connections between neurons, and it is widely agreed that, to keep these connections intact, they have to be ‘activated’ regularly. Retrieving a memory activates it.” Yet he cautions against the idea that we are “losing” our memories because we have outsourced them: “It’s not that they fade away, degrade or anything like that it’s just that our brains struggle to find them if they are seldom used.”Technology may affect us in more subtle ways, Ward believes. She cites a study in which participants who were shown a faked photo of themselves as children in hot-air balloons later “recalled” the nonexistent event. “Memories are not like filing cabinets,” she says. “Our brains adapt a lot of what we experience so that we can make sense of the world around us, and our memories are quite often representations or distortions of reality. Being bombarded with vast amounts of information and photos online may create what we call false memories.”Being able to capture your holiday entirely on a smartphone is convenient, for instance, but experiments have suggested that if you are doing this, you are not paying attention to your environment. If you are distracted, neural pathways in the brain are not being exercised in a way that would strengthen the memory, leaving it vulnerable to distortion.It is not all bad news when it comes to our reliance on Google and co, though. Other studies have shown it could benefit short-term memory and problem-solving. Gary Small, a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioural sciences at UCLA, compared the brains of “internet naive” and “internet savvy” older adults and found that neural activity increased among the naive group after they had spent a week searching for things online. “We saw significant increases, particularly in the frontal lobe – the thinking brain, the part of the brain that controls working memory.”He believes that this study shows that people can develop cognitive efficiency, and likens the memory to muscles. “It’s similar to what happens if you work out at the gym. At first, it takes a lot of energy to lift weights, but with training you can lift a lot more weight and exert less energy.”If you feel the need for some of this training, the memory athletes say that anyone can learn their techniques. Mullen says that before he was breaking world records, he had an average memory. That started to change after he read Moonwalking With Einstein, Joshua Foer’s book about his attempt to become the US memory champion. “You need to do a lot of practice,” Mullen says. “It just depends on how much you’re willing to put into it.”The most common technique used by memory athletes is the “method of loci”, better known to fans of the TV series Sherlock as the “memory palace”. The idea is that when memorising a list – such as a to-do list – you associate an image with every item on it. The images, which can be as absurd as you like, are then placed in the rooms in your “palace”, which will typically be your home or another familiar building. To recall the list, you imagine walking from one room to the next.Katie Kermode, from Cheshire, holds two world records: for memorising 105 names and faces in five minutes and for memorising 318 random words in 15 minutes. “I have a journey that goes around my house and other houses I have lived in,” she says. “I put two words in each room and I just associate those two words in a visual way. Then I walk back in my head through the different routes and I remember which words I saw.”Boris Nikolai Konrad, a Netherlands-based neuroscientist who is also a record-breaking memory athlete, says he has “60 or 70” memory palaces. “One is on the Thames in London, one is at Buckingham Palace and one is my former student house in Reading,” he says. But he uses a different technique to memorise long strings of numbers, creating an image for every two digits in what is known as a person-action-object mnemonic. The number 19, for example, could be represented by a giraffe (the “person”) eating (the action) leaves from a tall tree (the object). As one image follows another, a story or journey builds up, which helps somebody to recall the whole long series of numbers.Yanjaa Wintersoul, usually known as Yanjaa, is a Mongolian-born Swedish memory athlete based in New York, and is one of the more exciting figures in a sport that is hardly spectator-friendly. (“It’s a bit like a school exam with everyone sitting at their desks staring at paper,” is how Konrad describes the championships.) Like Mullen, Yanjaa was initially drawn to memory competitions after reading Moonwalking With Einstein. Yet she believes the techniques can help in other areas. “At the beginning, it feels elaborate and complicated, but in the end, it’s automatic and faster than anything you can possibly do any other way,” she says. “People see this as a wacky party trick, but the truth is it’s so helpful for mental health and focus.”She has seen that at first-hand. “In my case, the battle was with depression and anxiety. During the memory training, you’re spending all your time thinking about happy things – if you choose your imagery correctly.”With the right approach, even Kermode’s five-year-old can memorise shopping lists. “If the first item on the list is bread, I tell her to imagine that on her head,” Kermode says. “The next item, she imagines on her eyes, the next one, on her nose … and you just work down the list. When we get to the shop, she can tell me what we went to the shop for.”That must make visiting the supermarket more fun. But do the memory champions’ techniques help in more profound ways? Would we all benefit from retraining our brains? Burnett isn’t convinced. “It doesn’t actually help you understand anything,” he says. “It just helps you remember things. If you do crosswords every day, then you will become very good at doing crosswords. That doesn’t mean your brain has improved it just means your brain is now good at doing crosswords because it has the ability to specialise like that.”The neuroscientist Susan Greenfield argues that children should be taught to join up the dots rather than just recall them. She asks: “What is more important? Remembering the date of a battle, or understanding why the battle is important? We mustn’t confuse those quick memory tricks with understanding. If you understand something, you don’t have to make an effort to understand it – it’s just there.”Even the memory champions admit their hard-earned abilities have their limits. Mullen and Kermode say that if they don’t practise some of their skills, they begin to fade with time – and they still regularly have lapses in memory. “Despite being able to memorise names really well in competitions, I do forget them in real life,” Kermode says. “The other day, I not only forgot the name of someone I met, I also wasn’t sure if it was even the same person.”Still, there is one benefit that even the sceptics can’t quibble about. “Memory training has helped me remember where I put my keys much faster,” says Yanjaa.• This article was amended on 13 November 2018 to make it clear that the five-year-old mentioned was Katie Kermode’s daughter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7beb126d03373670af19c9723ed18429c7270dd/29_93_2061_1236/master/2061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14ae7b21000891ce38d7de342623c959","title":"england lions tour test players sri lanka","story":"As the projected costs of The Hundred mount, tripling from the original estimate of £13m up to £40m – and counting – budgets are being slashed at ECB Towers. Gone is Andrew Strauss’s pet North-South series, gone is the not-so-mourned Pace Programme, gone are the Overseas Placements that so benefited Ollie Pope and Mason Crane in consecutive winters in Sydney.But still hanging on, whether by thread or rope, is the Lions Programme, perhaps English cricket’s most secret and deadly weapon. The first part of this winter’s tour starts on Sunday against Pakistan A, with a four-day match at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium. Five one day and two Twenty20 games follow over the next three weeks, ricocheting between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Pope has been dispatched from the main England tour to get more match practice than he would twiddling his thumbs on the sidelines in Sri Lanka. Then, after Christmas, the Lions head to India.Lions cricket in the English summer has never been popular with the counties, understandably, because they lose more players in addition to those they provide to England. But in terms of gaining experience of overseas conditions in the winter, and preparing players for Test cricket, even they would concede its track record is actually very good.Of the side taking part in the second Test against Sri Lanka, only Jimmy Anderson, at the age of 36, has not pulled on a Lions cap – and that is because he is more mature than the programme itself. Of the others, Ben Stokes stands out as the only player to have been sent home in disgrace after breaking a curfew on the 2013 Lions tour of Australia and Rory Burns remains an oddity: he was finally called up, as captain, for the Lions this summer but it was the only time in his 28 years he had played representative cricket for England – before finally playing his first Test last week.Part of the rationale behind the programme was to give young cricketers experience of the subcontinent, where England teams have struggled and after a young and churlish Ian Botham claimed Pakistan was the type of place to send your mother-in-law for a month. Four of the younger crop of England players have prior experience of Sri Lankan conditions thanks to the Lions tour of 2016-17: Keaton Jennings, Jack Leach, Ben Foakes and Sam Curran.Jennings led the team on what was a tough tour – the sides drew the unofficial Tests 1-1 and Sri Lanka A won the one-day series 3-2. He captained in just the way you would expect: with calm, good-natured, short back and sides, head-boy sensibilities. He only made one half-century, but all was practice grist to his spin mill – sweeping, sweeping everywhere.Curran, who was only 18 at the time, took fewer wickets than his brother Tom, who was also on the tour, and struggled with the bat. But they both combined effectively at Pallekele on the outskirts of Kandy, the venue for the second Test – ensuring at least some happy memories to draw on.His Surrey teammate Foakes shone more brightly, and set down a marker that was not forgotten by England’s hierarchy. At the second unofficial Test at Dambulla, Foakes broke Steve Rhodes’ 24-year-old England A record of nine dismissals in a match. In a taste of what was to come, he took eight catches and made two stumpings, as well as making a nifty 50, as Sri Lanka clinched a nail-biter by three wickets.Andy Flower, not a man given to gushy outpourings, could not stop himself: “I know Bruce French, our lead wicketkeeping coach, was really proud watching Foakes’s performance, because he’s put in so many hours with Ben over the years, and the culmination of that was a real artist’s performance with the gloves. Ten dismissals but they were good dismissals – it’s not like they were all straightforward nicks. A number of them were standing up to the wicket, both stumpings and catches, and he took one of the best catches I’ve seen from a wicketkeeper ing to his right – and that was in the 128th over.”The tour was a difficult one for Leach – a period of painful rehabilitation away from the media. After a highly successful summer, where he had been the leading spinner in the championship, he had undergone routine tests at Loughborough before leaving for a holiday in Portugal. While lounging by the pool he had received a call from Flower – his action had come back with a kink in it. It came as a horrible shock. Leach had never been called for throwing in his life, no one had ever mentioned the possibility of a problem. Though the kink happened early on in his delivery – and was therefore easier to fix – it was quite a distance over the 15 degrees limit. The process of mending it was a painful one that meant long hours at Loughborough– something that became more painful after the results of his negative test were leaked to the press.He was still struggling when picked for the Lions tour, his first visit to the subcontinent, and he was not chosen for the first unofficial Test in Kandy. He gingerly took the remodelled action into the second Test and, though not back to his rhythmic best bowled 21 overs and took four wickets – a personal Rubicon.He went on to take 51 Division One wickets in 2017, then had a personally successful tour of West Indies with the Lions, before being flown out as replacement for Mason Crane in New Zealand and finally making his Test debut.

McIlroy has left the prospect he will not become a full European Tour member for a year as a live one.McIlroy confirmed on Tuesday that he has just two regular tour events planned for Europe from January, a scenario which will not change – if at all – until after all four major championships have been completed. European Tour guidelines state four must be played for full membership. While there remains scope for the Northern Irishman to feature in season ending tournaments, this is a situation the European Tour’s chief executive, Keith Pelley, could do without regarding such a high-profile player. McIlroy is now a US resident.Pelley had earlier stated his intention to make Europe a “viable alternative” to the PGA Tour. Justin Rose, the world No 2, has chosen not to feature in Dubai this week as he readies himself for an equipment change. Pelley has also come under fire regarding a European Tour competition being introduced next year in Saudi Arabia.McIlroy admitted “I don’t know” when asked whether he will renew European Tour membership, a call he must formally make before May.“I am starting my year off in the States and that will be the big focus of mine up until the end of August and then we will assess from there,” he said. “I’ve got a couple of ‘pure’ European Tour events on my schedule up until the end of August. I guess my thing is that I want to play against the strongest fields week-in and week-out and for the most part of the season that is in America.“If I want to continue to contend in the majors and to continue my journey back towards the top of the game, then that’s what I want to do.”Pertinently, 2019 sees drastic alterations to the golf schedule on both sides of the Atlantic. McIlroy, currently ranked No 7 in the world, had already been confirmed as participating in the European Masters, which takes place in Switzerland from the end of August. The likelihood is either the Irish or Scottish Opens will form the build-up to a bid to win a second Open Championship. The latter may take precedence as falling immediately before the Open.“Right now that is all sort of up in the air but if it were to be that I don’t fulfil my membership next year, it’s not a Ryder Cup year so it’s not the end of the world,” McIlroy said. “I am always going to want to play the Ryder Cup, so if that does happen so be it and I will try and make the Ryder Cup team with the year after it.”A fascinating subplot relates to a recently-introduced European Tour rule. Under that: “Players cannot be a European Ryder Cup captain or a vice-captain if they decline membership of the European Tour or fail to fulfil their minimum event obligation in any season, from 2018 onwards.” In reality, it seems highly unlikely McIlroy – a four-times major champion – would be denied such Ryder Cup status but this regulation could prove problematic.McIlroy hopes he has sorted another troublesome issue, this time relating to missing fairways. The 29-year-old has placed a new driver in his bag for this week’s DP World Tour Championship, having been concerned by a series of shots heading right from the tee.“I drove it well parts of the year but then whenever I got into final groups and under pressure, that right shot began to become more apparent. So you’re always trying to make your equipment help you as much as you can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc5402ce48321c1b298ad222256767d525174e8/323_886_3911_2347/master/3911.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c860e5f46d0406a54b35747d534340a","title":"magnus carlsen v fabiano caruana world chess championship game 4 live","story":"A few more moves: 15.

Ballet productions have historically been patchworks, each new one weaving changes and additions into surviving choreography. Yet rediscovered period notation has allowed specialists to recast the classics to their original form. Choreographer Alexei Ratmansky has been leading the way and has now unveiled his latest reconstruction, staged for Staatsballett Berlin: La Bayadère, an orientalist fantasy originally created by Marius Petipa for the Mariinsky Ballet in 1877.Unfortunately, it raises an uncomfortable question: what if 20th-century tinkering with La Bayadère actually improved it? One of the premises of reconstructions is that ballets were necessarily more coherent in their original form. Of Ratmansky’s four other period-based productions, some appeared to prove that point: his Sleeping Beauty (for American Ballet Theatre) and Swan Lake (for Zurich Ballet) were revelatory, unearthing a softer, warmer style and inner logic that had been lost.La Bayadère is a different kettle of fish. The pacing and balance of Petipa’s original work are deeply problematic. The first two acts, out of four, are mostly devoted to mime scenes and minor ertissements: it takes nearly an hour before any dancing of dramatic significance happens. Of the three main characters, the princess Gamzatti doesn’t even put on her pointe shoes until the last 30 minutes of this three-hour production.In the lead roles, Polina Semionova and Alejandro Virelles’s attempt at period style looks somewhat stiff but in the second cast, Anna Ol and Daniil Simkin bring Ratmansky’s vision to life with great care and, in Simkin’s case, technical chutzpah.The storytelling is certainly improved. The secret first-act rendezvous between temple dancer Nikiya and her lover Solor (who later betrays her to marry Gamzatti), is meticulously planned out, and then conducted, in mime. She tells him that she fears he will discard her because of her lowly status his promise of love, over a sacred fire, therefore feels more momentous, and better reflects Ludwig Minkus’s score.Yet at its core, La Bayadère remains a 19th-century orientalist fantasy. The sets and costumes of the reconstruction, by Jérôme Kaplan, are more richly detailed and subtler than most, but the ballet’s elephants, Indian dancers and priests still need to be taken with a pinch of salt, which renders Ratmansky’s attempt at renewed depth somewhat moot.And if you consider the ballet a pure dance extravaganza, 20th-century productions streamlined La Bayadère for the better. All modern versions are based on a 1940s revival with additional choreography by Vakhtang Chabukiani, which helped rebalance acts one and two. Filler numbers (including some dull corps choreography) were cast aside. Russian companies also dropped the fourth act altogether, ending the ballet with the dreamlike Shades scene in which Solor is reunited with Nikiya in his opium-fuelled dreams.Natalia Makarova’s 1980 production, still in the repertoire of the Royal Ballet, reinvented the fourth act from scratch in order to complete the plot. Ratmansky’s reconstruction features new dances, including a variation for Gamzatti that, jarringly, is now usually performed as part of Don Quixote’s Vision scene. Dramatically speaking, however, the final destruction of the Rajah’s palace – ine punishment for Gamzatti and Solor’s wedding, and here projected on to a screen – felt inconsequential.The Shades scene, by contrast, is one of Petipa’s greatest creations, a near-abstract parenthesis of classical dance for Nikiya, Solor and 32 women. Ratmansky returns it to its original tempo and style, fascinatingly, but doesn’t revolutionise it: much has been kept. There is no question that this reconstruction vastly improves our knowledge, but history hasn’t been unkind to La Bayadère, and it’s unlikely this production will supplant others in modern audiences’ affections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/924b837b0623420e72aa04eda6052cdb1ee030c5/1394_870_895_537/master/895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42c50a73449b2f8ea2fb9a30f57921ba","title":"yo yo ma mark morris layla and majnun clapton","story":"It is the ‘Persian Romeo and Juliet’ – a hokey old work full of paper beards, corny wedding tunes and lots of camels. So why has the great cellist teamed up with choreographer Mark Morris to freshen up Layla and Majnun?There was to be no leader, no dominant cultural voice. When Yo-Yo Ma founded the Silkroad ensemble in 1998, the cellist’s vision of an international community of musicians forging a global idiom of music was intrinsically democratic. But democracy has never been choreographer Mark Morris’s artistic style. As Ma cheerfully concedes, whenever the two of them have worked together: “Mark has always been the boss.” It’s Morris who has definitely been in charge of their joint reinvention of the Azerbaijani opera Layla and Majnun, premiered in 2017 and now opening in London.Based on a Persian equivalent of Romeo and Juliet, and composed from a wildly eclectic mix of western orchestration and traditional Azerbaijani singing, the 1908 opera had never been seen outside Baku before. In the original two and half-hour version, composer Uzeyir Hajibeyli leavened the tragedy with a robust stage energy. “It’s incredibly hokey,” says Morris, when I meet him in his artfully cluttered office in Brooklyn, “with all these camels and men with paper beards and corny wedding music.” But it was this energy that Morris thought was lost in Silkroad’s initial 45-minute chamber version of the opera. “It was “too brief and too gloomy. I wanted some of that kookiness back.”Morris chose to have Howard Hodgkin design the backdrop, an ecstatic swirl of green and salmon paint that seems to embrace the lovers’ infatuation, and he arranged to have the singers and musicians in the middle of the stage, with 15 dancers working around them. He wanted to create a sense of community, the performers grouped together like a nomadic caravan of artists but there were also practical reasons for this choice.Hajibeyli’s score features long passages of semi-improvised “mugham” singing, with the vocalists ornamenting their arias differently at each performance. The dancers and singers needed to be in the closest possible proximity, the former picking up on the latter’s physical and vocal cues so that they could embroider the choreography accordingly.The two singers, Alim Qasimov and his daughter Fargana, are megastars in Azerbaijan, incredibly grand, but they have proved very responsive if Morris has felt that a particular aria has gone on for a minute too long, the next night they will make it “exactly one minute shorter”. It was Qasimov who suggested the project to Ma in the first place. The cellist had never heard of Hajibeyli’s opera but as Qasimov explained the importance of bringing the work to a new audience he came to share the latter’s enthusiasm.Layla and Majnun’s tumultuous, tragic story has been fundamental to Islamic culture for centuries and has been reimagined as folktale, poetry, miniature painting, theatre, dance and film, but while it inspired Eric Clapton’s 1970 song Layla this treasure of the Islamic world has otherwise been little known in the west.Ma is defensively quick to address the issue of cultural appropriation in this project, alert to any suggestion that there may be something politically dodgy about an American choreographer staging an Azerbaijani classic at the behest of a French-Chinese-American cellist. Ma says he fully understands the need for sensitivity whenever Silkroad tackles the music of other cultures, but at a fundamental level he believes it’s a non-issue.“All culture is a matter of appropriation,” he says with real vehemence. “HELLO! I mean if we’re bothered by it we should first pull down all the buildings in America that resemble Greek and Roman architecture.” He insists that reimagining a work like Layla and Majnun isn’t about colonising other people’s art. “We’re just trying to look at what everyone around the world has created, we’re saying this is really cool stuff – look at this piece of pottery, look at this music.” What matters to him, always, is the integrity of their approach. “Doing any cultural project you have to start from the inside and Qasimov was such a trusted guide. It was he who wanted to take this opera all over the world and if you have a problem, then call him up.”Morris doesn’t consider himself a political artist, but it matters to him that this icon of Islamic culture is now being so widely seen. “Everyone’s treating Muslims like shit nowadays, and I can at least do this.” Ma concurs: “I think there is a ripple effect from the work we do. People tend to see Islam as just a large religious grouping, but Layla and Majnun is a very personal story, one that everyone can connect to … Politics and economics may create fracture, but culture is our way of understanding each other. It’s our way to survive.”Morris studied as many manifestations of the story as he could find and researched a variety of regional dance forms from Georgia, Armenia, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, even Indonesia. His resulting choreography is identifiably Morris in its full-bodied expressiveness but the movement is also rich with very exact stylistic references and quotes including Sufi spins, Georgian running steps and Balkan wedding dances.While Morris choreographs very quickly, he knows exactly what he wants in the rhythm, affect and shape of every step. One reason he has almost ceased creating works for companies other than his own is that he can exercise so little control over how the choreography is maintained, and knows how easily it can “be turned to hash”.The fear of “atrophy and distortion” is also why he’s taken the brilliantly rogue decision to embark on a series of “posthumous” dances. The deaths of Pina Bausch, Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor have caused anguished discussion about how adequately their legacies can be preserved. Morris, having seen too many horrible reconstructions of dead choreographers’ work, has circumvented the issue by creating pieces that his company will premiere only once he’s gone.“Everyone is going to die, that’s the one thing we know for sure,” he says. “My solution is to keep some fresh stuff coming out of the grave aside from flowers – and I can have a new dance premiered at my memorial service.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62ffbd703603582ed13f6534f8ad49544606c87b/0_160_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c06b47eb7299d9a701fcba55944cab65","title":"amazon hq2 second headquarters new york long island city response","story":"Residents wonder if company will be ‘good corporate citizen’ as governor hails decision to put headquarters in Long Island CityMore than 200 cities across North America spent a year competing for Amazon’s affections, lavishing tax breaks and other goodies for the chance to host the tech giant’s HQ2.Now, New York has won at least part of the prize – with Amazon splitting its second headquarters in two, and putting one of the new offices in Long Island City, Queens.But not everyone in the city is rolling out the welcome mat. A backlash developed even before Amazon made the move official with an announcement on Tuesday. Detractors denounced public subsidies for a corporate juggernaut and pointed to the potential for rising rents and overcrowded subways in a city that already has plenty of both.“To provide a billion dollars in taxpayer money at a time of scarce resources to one of the richest corporations in the world, that’s run by literally the richest man in the world – it’s obscene and it’s wrong,” Jimmy Van Bramer, who represents Long Island City on the city council, told the .Long Island City sits just across the East River from Manhattan. Decades past its industrial heyday, warehouses have given way to new residential and office towers – adding apartments at a pace that makes it the fastest-growing neighborhood in the city, and by some measures, in the entire country.To this mix, Amazon could add 25,000 workers on a large waterfront parcel. It’s set to receive more than $1.5bn in cash subsidies and tax breaks.New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, is bullish on the plan – so much so that he offered to take on a new name to gain the tech giant’s favor.“I’ll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that’s what it takes, because it would be a great economic boost,” he told reporters last week. “We put together a very strong incentive package.”Riders who get off the subway at Long Island City’s Court Square stop are greeted by the sound of hammering, with new buildings rising to join the glass towers already beckoning incoming residents with catchphrases like “artful living” and “live at the center of it all”.“There’s a crane on every corner,” said state senator Michael Gianaris. “It’s a historically working-class and middle-class neighborhood that’s changing rapidly, and people are being displaced by the day – already.”Stretching east from Long Island City along the 7 train line – plagued, like the rest of the city’s crumbling subways, with frequent shutdowns and delays – are erse immigrant neighborhoods such as Woodside, Jackson Heights and Elmhurst, which could all feel ripples from Amazon.Gianaris said he might have welcomed the Seattle-based behemoth to his backyard under other circumstances.“Ask not what we can do for Amazon – ask what Amazon can do for us,” he said. “I want the jobs, but what are you, Amazon, doing to make sure the mass transit system can handle it and there are enough school seats? … They should be talking about how they’re going to be good corporate citizens and help improve infrastructure, not wringing as much as they can out of us.”Neighborhood residents had mixed feelings. “It’s good and bad. It’s going to be good for local businesses, good for the local economy,” said Michael Giardina, 42.“It’s probably going to make the neighborhood get even more expensive than it already is,” he said. “Will it just become a neighborhood for wealthy professionals, or will it still be a neighborhood for everybody?”Other tech companies have made moves in New York with less fanfare, and less blowback.Google and Facebook are both expanding in the city, with Google planning a major expansion that could bring it’s workforce here up to a total of 20,000 jobs. The city has nurtured its tech sector, opening the new Cornell Tech school on Roosevelt Island, which sits just off Long Island City.Julie Samuels, executive director of Tech:NYC, hailed the addition of Amazon, saying that besides its own presence the talent it will draw could spur more tech startups around the city.“I can’t understand why you would want them anywhere but here,” she said. “In the short term, there might be some growing pains but that’s inevitable. And the truth is that in the long term the whole city and Long Island City in particular only stand to gain.”But critics find it hard to believe that Amazon conducted its year-long contest across the whole of America in good faith only to settle on New York and a suburb of Washington DC.Jersey City’s mayor, Steven Fulop, called the process “a big joke just to end up exactly where everyone guessed at the start”.“New York City is a winner on the merits, and the whole idea that Amazon would go through this charade of accepting 238 bids from places like Virginia Beach and Frisco, Texas, and places that never had a prayer, and then end up locating in the financial capital of the country and the political capital of the country has created justifiable blowback,” said Greg LeRoy of Good Jobs First.To get around the brewing political fight, the state is looking to use an economic development agency to approve the project without the city zoning approval that is usually required, the local officials said. New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, like his political rival Cuomo, supports the Amazon project. De Blasio, however, has said he opposes city-level tax subsidies for corporations like Amazon. .De Blasio nodded to the attitude among some residents that New York, as big and successful as it is, simply doesn’t need Amazon in the way some cities do.“Because we’re New Yorkers, we get a little bit … jaded. Our perspective’s a little funny – you know, we have almost 4.5m jobs so someone comes along talking about 25,000 or 50,000 new jobs and we’re like – a lot of New Yorkers are kind of like, that’s nice. Anywhere else that would be front page for a month, right? It’s just a seismic number of jobs,” he said. “Yeah, there will be hassles, there will be challenges, but I think we can accommodate them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92033cd1bfd70f89cd0ea5a2eb61fc5b62d6abf2/0_0_5117_3071/master/5117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dd562203111051eb89bc3fd4e3e08f","title":"five wheelie good cycling and hiking routes in thuringia","story":"From mountain peaks to Unesco-listed woodlands, castles and medieval villages, the German region boasts some of Europe’s most dramatic and enchanting landscapes1 The Rennsteig – Germany’s oldest hiking trailThuringia’s most famous hiking path is steeped in tradition, and known across Europe for its superb scenery. Hundreds of historic boundary stones – the symbol of the Rennsteig – mark the route and tell their own story about how this path was for years a border between the Franconian and Thuringian provinces.The 105-mile route winds down from the town of Eisenach (home of Wartburg Castle), via Suhl, and ends at Blankenstein, right on the current border between Thuringia and Bavaria. Today, there’s also a 120-mile cycle path that runs almost parallel to the walking route, but with longer deviations to avoid too many buttock-bashing hill climbs. But while the cycle path is still a teenager, the classic hiking route is nearly 700 years old. You can sense the souls that have trodden this famous path over the years, along the historic ridgeline above the forests. Some 100,000 walkers come every year to explore this evocative slice of countryside.

Running from Bad Kissingen to Bad Salzungen, via Kreuzberg and the Wasserkuppe mountain, the Hochrhoener trail snakes for 87 miles. It is split into nine stages, if you only want to walk a portion of the longer trail, and crests out at an impressive 876 metres. And if you still feel like you want to go higher, the Hochrhoener is the perfect place for gliding in Thuringia. If you gaze skywards from the paths you can often see gliders catching the currents, which are perfect here due to the geography of the mountains and the way the weather systems work their way through the area. Stargazers can veer off the main path on the Geba trail to discover the “Sternenpark” or Star Park – one of Europe’s leading dark sky landscapes. With platforms and viewing devices provided, it is ideal for gazing into space and spotting stars and planets. And for a taste of history, you can explore the Point Alpha trail leading to the Point Alpha military installations and the remains of the former inner German border – the iron curtain. In this area on the border there’s also Merkers mine – a former salt mine, where the Nazis stashed treasures during the second world war.3 The Thuringian Chain-of-Towns – long-distance cycle trailArchitecture aficionados will love this journey through the buildings and history of Thuringia’s main urban centres. The Chain-of-Towns trail runs for a total of 140 miles, but most of that is over flat to gently sloping ground – so the going is not like pulling teeth. And the route is also perhaps best enjoyed in small portions. Electric bikes are encouraged and regular charging stations pepper the route, plus there are a slew of DB (Deutsche Bahn) railway stations along the way, where you can let the train take the strain if you don’t want to cycle the whole thing. The Chain-of-Towns trail begins in Eisenach, home to the Unesco world heritage site, Wartburg Castle. Next, Gotha and its castle Schloss Friedenstein. Cosmopolitan Erfurt’s student population ensures plenty of bars, and its handsome, historic centre is home to such architectural highlights as the Old Synagogue – one of Europe’s oldest, which is itself home to the famous Erfurt Treasure of gold and silver. Then it’s on to historic Weimar and Jena, and then to Altenburg, where the route concludes.4 Saale cycle route – hills aplentyThose double-wheeled daredevils who look in awe at the Tour de France’s King of the Mountains exploits can find their cycling satisfaction on this challenging and ultimately rewarding run through the heart of the Thuringian hills following the River Saale. Coming in at a thigh-chafing 250 miles, the Saale cycle route calls for plenty of Vaseline in the panniers. The first part of the route from picturesque Fichtelgebirge through the high hills is the most spectacular, and tea breaks can be taken while you marvel at gorges or pristine lakes. As the river widens and flattens, castles and vineyards become more common sights. Bad Sulza’s wineries are especially noted for their bottles of Grüner Veltliner or Muscat Ottonel. Reaching Saalfeld, cyclists or walkers find the mesmerising Fairy Grottoes, listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world’s most colourful caves. Then, finally, you find peaceful meadows before the river joins the Elbe and flows on its long journey up to Hamburg and the North Sea. Jena is one of Thuringia’s main towns and provides plenty of sleeping, eating and shopping options. Optical innovator Zeiss was founded here and the town’s Zeiss Planetarium is rightly known for its audio and video shows.5 Schwarza Valley Panorama trail – for tree loversFans of forests can revel in this peaceful adventure through the trees that sprout on the eastern side of the Thuringian forest nature park. The park is packed with dense thickets of coniferous trees that provide a habitat for a huge variety of bird and animal species, and you can even forage for wild mushrooms and garlic. This 84-mile trail follows a loop route, starting and finishing in pretty Rudolstadt. Along the way, the trail passes various picture-postcard villages and towns such as Bad Blankenburg, Meuselbach, Altenfeld and Cordobang. The path sometimes rises out from the forest and up into the foothills of the Thuringian Schiefergebirge mountains – whose height and scenic value give the Saxon Switzerland hills, or even the Bavarian mountains, a run for their money. Aside from the obvious arboreal attractions, the Schwarza Valley Panorama trail also passes near to several castles perched on the banks of the River Saale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29183fbc69ae8c99a64004797697aeb9ca67dd87/0_315_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e496846af42c7313821eb685e53f0279","title":"from bach to bauhaus discover the culture of thuringia germany","story":"Immerse yourself in the German artistic gems that changed how we see the worldThuringia is the cultural heart of Germany, a place of inspiration for world-famous artists, writers, musicians and intellectuals. Remarkably, much of Thuringia’s cobbled streets and old stone architecture has barely changed since the time of Bach et al, so as well as touring the many museums devoted to these famous creative and intellectual figures, you have the opportunity to literally walk in their footsteps. Start right here ...Johann Sebastian Bach: baroque brought to lifeGermany’s greatest baroque composer was a jobbing musician throughout his life, and Thuringia is full of traces of his industrious career. Bach was an organist at Arnstadt, but his legacy is celebrated at the annual Thuringian Bach Festival in spring, and Eisenach (where he was born, in 1685) boasts the world’s biggest Bach museum. Housed in a splendid medieval building, the Bach House is devoted to the Bach dynasty – not only Johann Sebastian, but also his numerous musical relatives. The house is full of artefacts from Bach’s life and times, and each visit includes a short concert, played on original baroque-period instruments. If you’re a fan of classical music, you’ll also want to visit the Liszt House in nearby Weimar, where the great Hungarian composer Franz Liszt lived and worked.Martin Luther: the father of ReformationLuther spent his teenage years in Thuringia, first as a schoolboy in Eisenach, and then as a student at the University of Erfurt, graduating with an MA from its faculty of arts. While he was a student, Luther lived in Erfurt’s Augustinian Monastery (open to visitors – you can even stay the night). However, the most spectacular Luther site is Wartburg Castle, near Eisenach, where Luther hid, in disguise, from 1521 to 1522, and translated the New Testament into German – cementing the Reformation and establishing German as a national language. You can visit the room where Luther wrote his meisterwerk, where there used to be an ink stain on the wall – no longer visible – supposedly made when Luther threw an inkpot at the devil, who was trying to distract him.Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: the master of all tradesIt’s hard to overstate quite how important Goethe is to German culture. Poet, playwright, novelist, philosopher and scientist, his genius encompassed virtually every avenue of German intellectual life. Born in Frankfurt in 1749, he came to Thuringia as a young man, fresh from the success of his sensational first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and spent time in Erfurt, Jena and Gotha, before settling in Weimar. The baroque house, where he lived for 50 years, until his death in 1832, is now the Goethe National Museum. There are lots of other sites associated with Goethe all over Thuringia, from the Liebhabertheatre in Kochberg Castle to the Botanical Garden in Jena.Lucas Cranach (Elder and Younger): Renaissance father and sonLucas Cranach is one of Germany’s most celebrated painters, and Thuringia is full of paintings by this Renaissance master and his son. Lucas the Elder was the better painter, but his son was almost as good, and their styles are so similar that it’s often hard to tell them apart. Born in 1472, Cranach the Elder settled in Weimar near the end of his life to live with his son’s family, and his adopted hometown is full of mementoes of his life and work. There are plenty of paintings by both Cranachs in Weimar’s Castle Museum, but the crowning glory is the magnificent altarpiece in the Church of St Peter \u0026amp St Paul, started by Cranach the Elder and completed by his son. If you’re travelling around Thuringia, don’t miss the Friedenstein Palace in Gotha and the city’s art museum in Erfurt, which both have fine Cranach collections, and St John’s Church in Neustadt an der Orla, with its precious altarpiece. However, the most atmospheric setting for Cranach’s moody masterpieces is Wartburg Castle, where Cranach’s good friend Martin Luther hid away. The castle contains several acute portraits of Luther by Cranach the Elder, as well as some intimate, perceptive studies of Luther’s parents and his wife.Walter Gropius: founder of BauhausModernist architect Walter Gropius was born in Berlin in 1883, but it was in Thuringia that he made his name. In 1919 in Weimar, he founded the Bauhaus – a revolutionary design school that transformed the way we live today. Gropius taught his students to work across a wide range of disciplines – from pottery to printmaking, and carpentry to ceramics. He taught them to throw out the chintz, to see that less is more. His house style was stark, minimal and, above all, practical. Everything he made was fit for purpose. His ideas have since become commonplace, but in the 1920s they were shocking. In 1925, local conservatives drove him out of Weimar, and when the Nazis came to power he was forced to flee abroad. Yet, here in Thuringia, his influence lives on. Next year, bauhaus museum weimar marks the centenary of the Bauhaus with a move to a smart new building – a fitting forum for the world’s oldest Bauhaus collection. There are plenty of other Bauhaus sites elsewhere in Thuringia, including the Haus Auerbach in Jena, built by Gropius, and a Bauhaus-era hotel, the Haus des Volkes, in Probstzella.Carl Zeiss: a new visionBorn in Weimar in 1816, Zeiss trained as a fine machinist in Thuringia, and in 1846 he opened a workshop in Jena, making telescopes, microscopes and other optical devices. By the time he died, in 1888, his little workshop had grown into a large factory. By the beginning of the first world war, it was the largest camera manufacturer in the world. After the second world war, the Soviets stripped the factory bare, and took much of the equipment back to Russia, but although it ended up behind the iron curtain, Zeiss held its own against western competition – and when Germany was reunified it was one of the few East German firms to survive and prosper as a viable concern. You can learn all about Zeiss at the German Optical Museum in Jena, then visit the nearby Zeiss Planetarium, fitted with state-of-the-art Zeiss telescopes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd65faa3b93e5c08509382c208d06bddb43ec1a/0_1_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fe53e88f6e4e7958eddd3c5d549856e","title":"from chocolate to beef roulade the culinary delights of thuringia","story":"The German region may be known for its castles, jaw-dropping landscapes and the famous faces who lived there, but its culinary scene is also something to check out when you visitGerman food is just sausages, isn’t it, and sauerkraut? Well, yes, they do have 1,200 types of wurst – but this is a country with a huge ersity of cuisine, both traditional and contemporary. With more than 200 types of bread, a nationwide passion for vegetables, and an infinite range of regional styles, served everywhere from rural inns to the country’s 300-plus Michelin-starred restaurants, Germany is arguably home to some of the most underrated cuisine in Europe. And the culinary scene in Thuringia is well worth shouting about.So if the state’s erse history, from Martin Luther and Goethe to the Weimar Republic, and spectacularly bucolic landscape, aren’t enough to keep you occupied, Thuringia’s terrific cuisine will certainly ert the attention. A mustard museum in Erfurt and the annual Onion Festival in Weimar (with live music and food stalls, it attracts more than 350,000 people yearly) are proof of how seriously they take their food.The Thuringian bratwurst is the culinary kingpin of the region, but you can tuck in to other hearty dishes such as the succulent Mutzbraten (grilled pork) and Thuringian dumplings, or for those with a sweeter tooth, how about some handmade chocolate? And why not wash it all down with a dark beer, for which the region is well known, or a glass of white wine from Bad Sulza in north-eastern Thuringia? Just a few more reasons why Thuringia should be firmly on the tourist map.Thuringian bratwurstLocals claim the Thuringer rostbratwurst – its full name – is the best bratwurst in Germany. The original recipe dates back to 1434, so they certainly know what they are doing. Consisting of minced pork (local variations have beef or game) mixed with marjoram and garlic, some also feature caraway seed, although its inclusion is a subject of hot debate among Thuringians. It’s traditionally grilled over an open fire and eaten on the street with a bun and mustard (ketchup is a definite faux pas), but having it with sauerkraut and potatoes is also common. Locals consume nearly three times as many bratwursts a year than the average German.Try one from a street stall, or Faust Food, an indoor food market. Still pining for sausages? Then head to the Eichsfeld region in western Thuringia for three types of air-dried sausage: runde, feldkieker (which looks a bit like a club), or the spicy stracke, and you can sample them at the Klausenhof tavern in Bornhagen.Thuringer klösseThe dumpling is a staple dish of the region and traditionally served with a Sunday roast with lots of gravy. Filling and wholesome, the local dumpling doesn’t contain flour and is made of raw grated potatoes and cooked mashed potatoes, seasoned, rolled into fist-sized balls with two or three croutons stuffed inside and then simmered in water. They go well with meat or veg, and were originally popular with the less well-off as they were cheap to make. Try them at Die Landgrafenstube Wartburg Hotel in Eisenach or, for a cheaper alternative, head to Zum Guldenen Rade in Erfurt.MutzbratenA tasty chunk of seasoned pork, which is flame grilled – traditionally over a birchwood fire. It’s served with bread, sauerkraut and mustard. Try one in Schmölln or Altenburg, in the eastern part of the state, where it is something of a speciality, or in an inn or restaurant while walking in the Thuringian Forest.Goldhelm chocolate Inspired chocolate creations are what you will find at Goldhelm Schokolade, which has two outlets in Erfurt. There’s a tiny shop on Krämerbrücke (Merchants’ Bridge), the longest inhabited bridge in Europe – it dates from the 14th century – or there’s a larger version with a lovely cafe on nearby Kreuzgasse. Using high-grade cocoa from Peru and Vietnam allows the makers to lower the sugar content. Their signature chocolate is the Bridge Truffle. They do a memorable hot chocolate too.Beers, wines and spiritsThuringia has a long tradition of brewing beer and producing wine: in the middle ages there were nearly 600 breweries in Erfurt, Germany’s oldest beer purity law was laid down in Weissensee in 1434. The region is known for its dark beers, one of the best is Köstrizter from the little town of Köstritz. Most towns have their own breweries, such as those in Weimar, Eisenach and Erfurt (head here to the Goldener Schwan, which has a wide variety of beers, including wheat and pilsner). Hikers in the Thuringian Forest should visit the Ankerla Brewery in Steinach.Oenophiles will find some fabulous white wines, too – and some very good reds – around Bad Sulza in the north-east one of the best vineyards is Weingut Zahn in Grossheringen, which has a restaurant and tours.And don’t forget to try Thuringia’s range of digestifs, or kräuterschnaps. You will find them in most bars and restaurants – look out for Aromatique, made in Neudietendorf, using spices and herbs Rhöntropfen, produced since the 1870s in the Rhön region and also made with herbs and spices, and Nordhäuser Doppelkorn, a grain brandy from Nordhausen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9425f5b81f3dc73a33d4d83278462aaa4181fd7c/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfbed519ba607a04b1c62249fb1af8ea","title":"fairytale castles and secret forests discover germanys best kept secret","story":"Deep in the heart of Germany lies Thuringia – a state bursting with both cultural curiosities and unrivalled natural beautyExplore the wildernessThe 700-year-old Rennsteig trail traces a spectacular ridgeway through the Thuringian forest, and is a mecca for hikers and cyclists. Originally a trade route in the Middle Ages, the path is popular with both walkers wishing to get away for a while and cyclists up for a serious challenge. With 105 miles running from Bach’s birthplace, Eisenach, to the river Saale in Blankenstein, there is plenty to take in.Medieval wondersStrewn across Thuringia’s lush scenery are an incredible 400 castles and palaces. Queen Victoria, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha famously danced at Schloss Friedenstein, while Richard Wagner’s operatic masterpiece Tannhäuser was inspired by Wartburg Castle, now a Unesco world heritage site and home to a 9,000-strong treasure trove of European art. Erfurt, the state capital, is also worth a visit. Peek inside St Mary’s Cathedral, where the 16th century monk Martin Luther was ordained, before taking in Erfurt’s perfectly preserved medieval old town that’s most impressive.Art and cultureEver since a youthful Johann Wolfgang von Goethe arrived in the city of Weimar, flushed with success from his romantic bestseller The Sorrows of Young Werther, Thuringia has been a haven for artists, philosophers, musicians, innovators and reformers. Weimar’s numerous coffee houses were frequented by everyone from Johann Sebastian Bach to Friedrich Nietzsche, Wassily Kandinsky and Marlene Dietrich. The world-class design school Bauhaus opened in Weimar in 1919 – before moving to Dessau in 1925 – and next year’s centenary will be marked with a plethora of parties and special events, culminating in the grand opening of the new bauhaus museum weimar.Take a different viewPrize for the coolest place to see goes to the Carl Zeiss-Planetarium in Jena. The world’s oldest planetarium, built in 1926, features an impressive dome projection system where Pink Floyd and Queen provide the soundtrack to gas clouds and galaxies. And for holiday snaps unlike anyone else’s Instagram feed, visit Erfurt-Rieth: a concrete jungle of 1970s GDR architecture, complete with retro-futurist skywalks, plattenbau tower blocks, murals and sculptures.The best of the wurstIt would be remiss not to mention Thuringia’s legendary sausages – rostbratwursts, or “rosters” – which are one of the world’s most delicious things to put on a BBQ, slather in mustard and slap into a sliced roll. The marjoram and spices in these protected-designation-of-origin sausages bring them to life. Satisfy your sweet tooth with a slice of sheet cake topped with plums and crumble, or indulge in handmade chocolates from the Goldhelm workshop in Erfurt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9227cba3c7f2510da1984b4925f84672315ed48a/0_65_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1983547c1af65d20143ba144e685f57a","title":"doctor who is the series finally getting it right on race","story":"After 55 years, it was about time the series faced up to its fairly un-PC record – much to the outrage of Jeremy ClarksonWith episodes featuring Rosa Parks and the 1947 partition of India, this season of Doctor Who has reached back into history to tell some of the most racially charged stories of the 20th century. It has been a throwback to the show’s original educational roots – but has raised questions about how Doctor Who has handled race both on and off-screen in the past.Devised in 1963 to bridge the gap on a Saturday afternoon between the sports results and the evening’s TV schedule, creator Sydney Newman always envisaged that Doctor Who would have “a high educational content” and be as much about exploring earth’s past as it was about exploring the universe. William Hartnell’s original Doctor met Marco Polo, Nero and King Richard I among others.With Rosa and Demons of the Punjab, new head writer Chris Chibnall seems to have deliberately re-amplified that educational purpose. But both episodes have been notable for other off-screen reasons. Incredibly, with nearly 300 Doctor Who stories having made it to screen over the last 55 years, acclaimed children’s author Malorie Blackman is the first black writer the show has ever had, while award-winning Vinay Patel is the first writer of Asian descent to contribute a story.The approach has not been without criticism, though. Last week the Jeremy Vine show asked “Has Doctor Who become too politically correct?” while Jeremy Clarkson in The Sun, despite saying he hasn’t “watched Dr Who since I was a small boy”, claimed falling ratings were due to the show trying to indoctrinate viewers with lefty dogma. (The current version of Doctor Who is the most popular in a decade.)There is much to be applauded in the approach taken this year, though, as a sign that the show is attempting to get to grips with how Doctor Who has dealt with race and racism in the past. Earlier this year streaming service Twitch showed most of Doctor Who’s original 1963 to 1989 episodes back-to-back, and it only served to illustrate for a modern audience how the original series had been almost exclusively cast as white people. With the occasional exception of characters like Earl Cameron’s astronaut in The Tenth Planet or Carmen Munroe’s Fariah in The Enemy of the World, there are very few black actors on screen. And when they are, they often fall into the trope of being silent strongmen. It isn’t only the “classic” era of the series that has prompted questions about Doctor Who’s on-screen portrayal of race. Turn Left (2008) is a story that I absolutely love – but it is framed by the trope of inscrutable and mysterious Asian fortune-tellers, in scenes which a British-Chinese friend of mine has described as painfully unwatchable.The climax of Peter Capaldi’s final season, World Enough and TimeThe Doctor Falls, has also been criticised for the racial subtext on display. In the story, companion Bill is converted to being a Cyberman, and then is told by the Doctor to exercise self-control for the rest of the story to avoid firing the weapons built into her new body. Mel Perez critiqued that approach in a brilliantly thoughtful review of the episode. “I can’t ignore the optics of a white man telling a black woman who is justifiably upset to not get angry because now her anger is dangerous,” she wrote. “I can’t ignore the optics of having a black woman sleep in the barn because she frightens the children … This is our history and this is our present without the excuse of being a Cyberman.”Some of the established symbolism of the show also looks different through a modern lens. Last month, Constance Gibbs, writer and editor at Black Girls Create and contributor to the Time and Relative Blackness in Space podcast, wrote a thoughtful explanation of how, to white children in the 1960s, a Police Box offering urgent help would have appeared as a welcome sight. That is not, she argued, how it would look to members of the BAME community – and as the show has internationalised its fanbase, especially not to African-Americans in a time of #BlackLivesMatter. “Police officers aren’t a source of comfort, safety and respect in the black community, and many others. The word ‘police’ instills fear,” she wrote. “The word ‘police’ conjures memories of men in uniform murdering black people for doing as little as selling loose cigarettes – or holding a wallet, violating traffic laws, jaywalking, take your pick.”The argument that Doctor Who has suddenly become “woke” or is pursuing a new SJW agenda is nonsense, of course. If nothing else, the Doctor has always been a warrior for social justice. Fighting for the underdog and righting wrongs by peaceful, intelligent means are the essential ethos of the show. This brilliant list of 130 times Doctor Who was just “too PC” prior to Whittaker’s casting shows how much the show’s history has been shaped that way.It didn’t always get things right in the past. The casting of John Bennett in yellowface as a stereotypical Chinese villain Li H’sen Chang was an extreme low. Likewise, did Mickey Smith, Danny Pink, Clyde Langer and Ryan Sinclair – the four most prominent young black male characters to feature in the Doctor Who universe – all have to come from some form of broken home with an absent father? A more erse writing team may have at least noticed that recurring pattern.But the show should also take care with this approach. It is brilliant to have a black woman writing about the actions of one of the most famous and impactful black women of the 1950s. It is brilliant to have a talented playwright of Asian descent addressing the way Britain treated India after the end of the second world war – and to avoid the jolly old heroic imperial Churchill cliche we saw on screen in Matt Smith’s time. But are we in danger of seeing a Doctor Who that hires writers of colour when it wants to tell stories of colour, and nothing else? I guess we’ll find out when the roster of writers for the next, seemingly delayed, season is announced. At the end of Rosa, my nine-year-old daughter burst into tears about how awfully Parks and the other black characters had been treated, sparking a discussion at home about racism in America and the UK, how it was in the past, and, as Yasmin and Ryan had explained on-screen, how it continues and affects people with their colour of skin in the present day.Educational job done on that score at least. I expect all these years later, Sydney Newman would have been proud that the Doctor Who format he helped devise was still having that power over what he described in the original briefing notes for the series as “the most critical, difficult, even sophisticated audience there is” – children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb130f253fbdb62b0a9bb70f3c56a530e3fff40e/0_105_3150_1890/master/3150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b8b9018aa8ab00de67acf816da64150","title":"stan lee fans stars pay tribute to comic","story":"Actor Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Winston Duke, and Seth Rogen among those who hailed the creator of Marvel comicsTributes poured in from fans and celebrities hailing the comic creator Stan Lee on Monday, who died at the age of 95.“There will never be another Stan Lee.

There was, however, a behind-the-scenes follow-up to the incident that shows the Soviet leader in another light.Khrushchev bore no grudge against the Irish diplomat who had chaired the session, one of the most contentious in the annals of diplomacy, and in an apparent gesture of conciliation sent him a bottle of Russian wine.Frederick Boland, Ireland’s first ambassador to the UK and the UN, disclosed the gesture in a note to his chiefs in Dublin, which is due to be published this week in a release of official archives.After leaving the UN gathering in New York, the Soviet leader dispatched a Russian diplomat called Zorin to the Irish diplomatic mission to “express his regret” for not being able to call and say goodbye, Boland said in his note, according to the .Zorin said Khrushchev was “well satisfied” with Boland’s objectivity as chair of the plenary session and hoped he would continue. “That evening a case of Russian wine was delivered at 1 East End Avenue with his compliments!”Boland had broken his gavel during the session in a vain effort to impose order after the leader of the Philippine delegation, Lorenzo Sumulong, earned Khrushchev’s ire by denouncing Soviet oppression in eastern Europe.Accounts differ over whether Khrushchev banged his desk or the rostrum with his shoe, or merely brandished the shoe, while calling Sumulong a lackey of American imperialism. The outburst mortified some colleagues.His granddaughter Nina said he had removed his shoes earlier because they were new and tight. He was banging his fist on the table when his watch fell off and the “good performer” spotted an opportunity. “He bent down to pick up the watch and saw his empty shoes. How lucky!”Boland’s anecdote suggests the Soviet leader, shoeless or not, did not want to step on his hosts.In his note the diplomat called the Soviet leader an enigma. “He is the personification of elemental violence. Moreover, like Hitler, he is power-drunk and a doctrinaire. These dangerous qualities are tempered in his case, however, by an extraordinarily sharp intelligence, a keen sense of humour and, I would say, a good deal of plain humanity. He doesn’t carry his official resentments into his personal relations.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3696577.1542125690!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit deal vital to maintain british visitor numbers says tourism chief","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNiall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland Photograph: Dave MeehanThe A hard Brexit could hit the number of British tourists visiting Ireland, the head of Tourism Ireland Niall Gibbons has warned.Mr Gibbons said it was vital that a deal was struck between the European Union and the British government in order to mitigate the potential negative fallout from Brexit.The Tourism Ireland chief executive was one of a number of speakers at a seminar in Belfast on Tuesday examining how to maintain cross-Border collaboration and strengthen connections on the island in the culture, arts, sport and tourism sectors post Brexit.On Monday, Fáilte Ireland chief executive Paul Kelly said in relation to a potential reduction in British visitors Brexit could cost the Irish tourism industry between €380- €390 million.Mr Gibbons did not think it would be that bad but said “in the worst case scenario” the United Kingdom quitting the European Union would be costly.Currently the island of Ireland attracts 4.5 million British visitors each year spending €1.3 billion. But the number of British people travelling abroad is starting to decline, and is down about three per cent, he explained at the cross-Border conference.“The British take about 70 million trips abroad each year,” Mr Gibbons told The  on the periphery of the breakfast seminar organised by the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce.“The first year after Brexit that increased,” he said. “This year it started to reduce, so economic certainty and uncertainty play a big role in people’s mood.”From recent polls, Tourism Ireland had ascertained that there was unlikely to be any drop in British people taking holidays or breaks in different parts of England, Scotland and Wales but there was the likelihood of a decline in the number of such tourists travelling to Northern Ireland.“People in England, Scotland and Wales are more likely to visit places such as Devon and Cornwall, the Lake District and Scotland than the Channel Islands, Isle of Man, and Northern Ireland,” he said.Mr Gibbons said that in recent years there has been a 50 per cent increase in hotel accommodation in Northern Ireland with bedroom stock due to be just over 10,000 by 2020.There was concern within the industry that if Brexit put curbs on immigration it could result in a shortage of chefs and other hotel workers and ultimately upset that expansion.“It is just essential that a deal gets done,” said Mr Gibbons.Niamh Flanagan of TheatreNI, the support organisation for drama and the performing arts in Northern Ireland, said while the EU has pledged to provide some peace-funding after Brexit that there was great concern about a drop in financial support and what that would mean for an already poorly-financed arts sector.She said there were scores of actors and drama groups involved in cross-Border productions and reliant on funding, some of which came from Europe. If that dried up it would be detrimental for theatre in Northern Ireland.Theatre and the arts in general were vital to the well-being of society, added Ms Flanagan. “Our arts programming animates our cities and the towns. The arts are part of the eco-system of health and well being, of community cohesion and peace-building,” she said.Richard Williams, head of Northern Ireland Screen, said he had concerns about Brexit in terms of its impact on the burgeoning local film industry but said that the chief message was that it was “business as usual”.“We have seen no drop or real concern in terms of inward investment. My primary response to Brexit is to ignore it, to keep going, to maintain momentum,” he said.“But the main thing we can do now in relation to Brexit is not to turn concern into catastrophe by over-exaggerating the problem,” he added.Northern Ireland Office junior Minister Lord Ian Duncan looked forward to the day when politics had moved on and Brexit was a matter that could be viewed in the “rear view mirror”.It was important that people not be distracted by Brexit, he added. “Do not let it be the defining moment of a generation, it need not be so,” said Lord Duncan.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Oli ScarffGetty ImagesIt is an arrangement that permits ease of travel and other benefits such as reciprocal residency for immigrants, between the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. It dates from 1922 when the Irish Free State chose to operate the same travel restrictions as the UK.The Common Travel Area is based on a collection of legal provisions rather than on an international treaty or concrete agreement. There is no single legal agreement establishing its arrangements.The 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, establishing the Irish Free State’s independence from the UK, did not contain arrangements for cross-border travel, though this continued as Ireland remained part of the British Empire as a Crown Dependency. The UK and Irish Free State agreed an administrative understanding in 1922 that maintained free movement of people. Ireland remaining part of the Commonwealth meant Irish nationals could live and work in Britain as any other British subject.This backstop fell away with Ireland’s declaration as a Republic and departure from the Commonwealth with the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 that came into force in April 1949.London responded with the 1949 Ireland Act that afforded special status to Irish citizens within the UK and which resulted in Ireland generally not being treated as a “foreign country” under UK law.The modern Common Travel Area came into force in 1952 when, against the backdrop of post-war labour shortages in the UK and emigration pressures in Ireland, an informal agreement was built into UK and Irish law by statutory instrument. This was done quietly due to the political sensitivities in Ireland over concerns it would be seen as undermining independence and restoring subservience to London.Four academics have recommended that the best way to safeguard the Common Travel Area is for an agreement to be reached between Ireland and the UK.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Getty The EU and UK have agreed the main details of the withdrawal agreement for the UK’s departure from the EU, including a mechanism to guarantee that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. The deal is expected to be put to the UK cabinet tomorrow but reports suggest members of Theresa May’s government are to be briefed this evening. The agreement involves the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU for a period after Brexit and specific other measures to ensure no border checks are needed on the island of Ireland. Close attention will be paid to the terms on which the UK would be able to leave the customs union, with the deal believed to include three options. One will be the conclusion of a long-term trade agreement between the EU and UK, the terms of which would guarantee no border checks on trade.Sources in Dublin believe that the outline agreement offers sufficient guarantees in relation to the Border. The backstop agreed – the mechanism to ensure this – centres on the so-called UK-wide arrangement, where the whole of the UK would remain in a customs union with the EU for a period after Brexit. Specific other measures will be included for Northern Ireland. The detail of the arrangement will be closely examined by the DUP, who have objected to anything which would represent a new barrier to trade between the North and Britain.The key issue in the last few days is understood to have been demands from the other EU members that the UK give sufficient guarantees to ensure their businesses will be operating on a level playing field after the UK leaves.

Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesTheresa May told her cabinet on Tuesday morning that there was still a “small number of outstanding issues” to be resolved for the UK and Brussels to finalise a Brexit agreement.At the weekly cabinet meeting, the British prime minister said there was still some way to go before a “best text” could be agreed, officials said.Asked when the talks with the EU might conclude, a Number 10 spokesman replied: “How long is a piece of string?”Speaking in a BBC interview ahead of the meeting, David Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister, said he was “optimistic because we have managed to get things down to a small number of difficult issues outstanding”.Mrs May still hopes that the EU will convene a special European Council meeting on November 25th to sign off an agreement, leaving her very little time to agree an exit text.UK officials have admitted that unless there is a breakthrough by the end of Wednesday, the timetable for an EU Brexit summit could slip into December.Mrs May wants to win parliamentary approval for any deal before Christmas.Dominic Raab, Brexit secretary, has told colleagues the government will start implementing contingency plans for a no-deal outcome, if no progress has been made.Cabinet ministers discussed Brexit for 45 minutes during the meeting at Downing Street that also covered NHS preparedness for a winter crisis and an update on military veterans.Mr Raab led a discussion of government preparedness on a no-deal Brexit and Mrs May briefed cabinet ministers on the progress of the negotiations.The biggest obstacle remains the exit mechanism that would allow Britain to leave a temporary customs arrangement – a backstop to avoid the reintroduction of a hard border in Ireland.Eurosceptic ministers, who met in trade secretary Liam Fox’s office on Monday to co-ordinate tactics, insist Britain must have the right to walk away from the arrangement.The EU is insisting on a joint review mechanism to end the temporary arrangement, which would last until a permanent UKEU trade deal put in place a frictionless border in Ireland.Eurosceptic ministers will resist any role for the European Court of Justice in this mechanism.A number of pro-Brexit ministers have warned privately that a no-deal outcome would be better than any deal that could theoretically leave Britain trapped in a customs union.Given the proximity of the two sides to a deal, it is likely that Mr Raab and Mr Barnier will be involved in the final stage of negotiations to give a political impetus to the talks. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

food worldwide wasted reaches plate says study","story":"Waste and spoilage in harvesting, storage, transport and shops accounts for an estimated 1.3 billion tonnes of food a year A third of the world\u0027s food is lost before it ever reaches anyone\u0027s plate, a panel of global experts has warned as it called for a war on waste to improve worldwide diets.Waste and spoilage in harvesting, storage, transport and shops accounts for an estimated 1.3 billion tonnes of food a year and squanders huge amounts of resources.At the same time, poor diet is now more of a threat to public health than infectious diseases like malaria and measles, the Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition said.Food rich in nutrients vital for a healthy diet, such as fruit and vegetables, meat and fish, dairy products, and seeds and nuts is particularly prone to going off, or being wasted.The panel led by the UK\u0027s former chief scientific adviser, Sir John Beddington, estimated the value of wasted food reaches $ 1 trillion (£777bn) each year.Stunting | A silent emergency threatening millions of young lives“Poor-quality diets are now a greater public health threat than malaria, tuberculosis or measles,” a new paper by the panel warns.One-in-five deaths are now due to poor diet and that figure is likely to increase. The panel said the growing numbers who are overweight or obese was a particular worry.“Meanwhile, approximately one third of all the food produced for human consumption never reaches the consumer’s plate or bowl.”Cutting back on the amount of food wasted would not only potentially save billions, but would also help hit targets to reduce malnutrition and improve diets causing disease. Land would be freed up and scare water supplies would be preserved.“The numbers are staggering,” the panel reported. “Each year more than half of all the fruits and vegetables produced globally are lost or wasted. A vital source of protein, around 25 per cent of all the meat produced – equivalent to 75 million cows – is not consumed.”Opinion | We must give new meaning to the food we eatThe fight against global hunger has in recent decades relied on growing more starchy staple crops like grains. But while that has seen the proportion of starving people fall sharply, billions are left with unhealthy diets. Squandering less of the nutritious food already grown could dramatically improve diets, the panel said.In developing countries, waste is high after food is harvested and while it is being processed, as poor storage and transport often leads to it spoiling or rotting. In developed countries there is high waste in shops and homes where food is thrown out.“Reducing loss and waste in nutritious foods would yield substantial benefits far beyond addressing hunger and malnutrition,” the paper concludes.“The gains made would contribute to the efficiencies needed to address climate change. Eating more of the nutrient-rich food already being produced would unlock savings in water and energy consumption, land use, and resources used in industrial food fortification.”Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article  Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Brexit latest: Theresa May poised to hold emergency cabinet meeting as she closes in on dealLondon\u0026#39s murder rate hits grim milestone after spate of bloodshedCalifornia\u0026#39s current wildfire nightmare could be the new normalSuperbugs: New strain of \u0026#39highly\u0026#39 drug resistant typhoid detectedSri Lanka\u0026#39s Supreme Court overturns dissolution of parliament in political power struggleAge restrictions on porn websites delayed by government againCNN sues Donald Trump and White House aides for suspending Jim Acosta\u0026#39s press passHeir hunter who ignored will and tried to sell dead model\u0026#39s £600k home to make commission ordered to pay £250kCalifornia wild fires: Should I cancel my holiday?10,000 tourists for every resident: Overtourism reaches Holland\u0026#39s 18th century windmills\u0026#39Make France great again!\u0026#39 Trump mocks Macron over world war occupation and threatens wine tariffs in Twitter rant\u0026#39Brexodus\u0026#39: Number of EU migrants working in UK falls by biggest amount since records began\u0026#39Mega homes\u0026#39 to be banned in central London as Westminster council sets limit on size of new builds Pharmacist accused of murdering wife was having affairs on Grindr, court hearsKyrsten Sinema narrowly wins Arizona Senate race as Democrats claw back lossesComment: Mrs May cannot afford to lose Dominic Raab — so he can throw his weight aroundBaby delivered by paramedics after pregnant mother dies in crossbow attackSeventeen migrants who stole French trawler and crossed the Channel arrested in DoverWatch the terrifying moment a sinkhole suddenly opens up under a woman\u0026#39s feet We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch stan lees best marvel movie cameos","story":"Aside from is work co-creating dozens of Marvel Comics characters, American comics legend Stan Lee was also known by his fans for making cameos on his Marvel movies.Lee’s cameo appearances date back to the 1960s, when his likeness would occasionally pop up in the pages of the Marvel comics he oversaw.  But his short appearances in the Marvel movies became an anticipated feature among fans.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet. On Tuesday, the company announced it would give away $125m-worth (£96m) of the Stellar cryptocurrency as part of a major initiative to encourage its use as a mainstream form of payment.Stellar is currently not even in the top five cryptocurrencies in terms of its total value, according to CoinMarketCap, but while it may be lesser-known, its backers say it is more technologically advanced and better suited to large-scale usage.\u0026nbspethereum cryptocurrency has a market cap of around $22\u0026nbspbillion (Getty Images)Another cryptocurrency that could see massive gains in the coming months, some experts say, is bitcoin\u0027s closest rival ethereum. Technology expert Ian McLeod of Thomas Crown Art said\u0026nbspthat the world\u0027s second largest cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a monumental, defining global breakout.\u0026nbspCurrently trading at just above $200 – down from a high of $1,350 in January –\u0026nbspMr McLeod\u0026nbspclaims ethereum\u0026nbspcould reach as high as $500 by the end of 2018 and could see its price explode in 2019 and beyond.“We can expect bitcoin to lose 50 per cent of its cryptocurrency market share to ethereum, its nearest rival, within five years,\u0026nbspMr McLeod\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbsp“Ethereum\u0026nbspis already light years ahead of\u0026nbspbitcoin in everything but price\u0026nbspand this gap will become increasingly apparent as more and more investors jump into crypto.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe traffic misdirection, known as a border gateway protocol (BGP) hijacking, lasted for around an hour and a half on Monday evening, ending at around 10.30pm GMT.ThousandEyes\u0026nbspexecutive Alex Henthorn-Iwane\u0026nbspsaid it was the worst incident affecting Google traffic that his firm had ever seen. He also speculated that the hijacking may have been the result of a war-game experiment.The incident\u0026nbspwas particularly suspicious because internet\u0026nbsptraffic was being sent to the Chinese government’s\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspprovider, China Telecom, which has previously been accused of improperly\u0026nbsprouting\u0026nbsptraffic through China.A report\u0026nbspearlier this year by researchers at the US Naval War College and Tel Aviv University found\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbspTelecom has\u0026nbspbeen hijacking internet\u0026nbsptraffic passing through the US and Canada on a regular basis.Conveniently, China Telecom has ten strategically placed, Chinese controlled internet ‘points of presence’4 (PoPs) across the internet backbone of North America, the report\u0026nbspstated.\u0026nbspVast rewards can be reaped from the hijacking, erting, and then copying of information-rich traffic going into or crossing the United States and Canada – often unnoticed and then delivered with only small delays.A Google spokesperson told The Independent: “We’re aware that a portion of internet traffic was affected by incorrect routing of IP addresses, and access to some Google services was impacted. The root cause of the issue was external to Google and there was no compromise of Google services.”In an update to its Google Cloud Status Dashboard, Google said it was conducting an internal investigation in the hope of\u0026nbspmaking\u0026nbspappropriate improvements to help prevent a future recurrence of the issue.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I’ll announce the release date once it’s done. Thank you for understanding.These delays are not the only times West has decided to release the\u0026nbspalbum later than expected.

That sounds like a choice.Kanye made this comment in a May 2018 interview with TMZ. He later clarified that, in saying slavery was a choice, he meant we can make our own realityThe wait was worth it, as ye came accompanied by four other West-produced records, including Cudi\u0026nbspcollaboration Kids See Ghosts, Pusha T\u0027s Daytona, Teyana Taylor\u0027s K.T.S.E., and Nas\u0027s\u0026nbspNasir.Those five albums that I dropped earlier were like superhero rehabilitation,” West said of the records, while also\u0026nbsppromising\u0026nbspthe upcoming release will\u0026nbspbe a full album.\u0026nbspYandhi already has an album cover – a clear MiniDisk with purple tape on it.Considering how the album has been\u0026nbspdelayed multiple times, chances are the album cover could also be changed, especially as the MiniDisk\u0026nbspcover is reminiscent of the 2013\u0027s\u0026nbspYeezus\u0026nbspcover. If West has changed the record sonically, perhaps the visuals will also change?What have we heard of Yandhi so far?Whether any previously released tracks will actually appear on the album remains to be seen. However, West has released a couple of loose tracks this year, including the \u0026nbspLil Pump collaboration “I Love It” and the track “XTCY”.During his Saturday Night Live appearance, West\u0026nbspperformed “We Got Love” with Teyana Taylor, a track initially meant for her album K.T.S.E,\u0026nbspwhich he produced.\u0026nbspWest\u0026nbspalso released a snippet of a track on Instagram, uploaded during the build-up to the album\u0027s initial release on the 29 September. Again, with so many changes to the record, chances are the full song may never see the light of day.Who will feature on Yandhi?A variety of other artists are rumoured to appear on the record, including regular collaborators Kid Cudi, 070 Shake, Ty Dolla Sign and Young Thug.Perhaps the most controversial collaborators expected to appear on the record include\u0026nbsp6ix9ine and XXXTenacion, the latter of whom West says recorded vocals before his untimely death earlier this year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She also said there was no upper limit to the distance\u0026nbspa person may be required to travel in order to attend their nearest reporting location.\u0026nbspCharities said the change meant disabled and mentally unwell asylum seekers were having to make long and expensive journeys to comply with immigration rules.Some\u0026nbspreceive no support at all, which has reportedly left them with\u0026nbspno way of paying\u0026nbsptravel costs without begging, borrowing or even putting themselves in exploitative situations to be able to earn\u0026nbspmoney.While there is purportedly a reimbursement scheme, campaigners said it was “at best complicated and unpractical”, and that many people were still not receiving money.Around\u0026nbsp500 asylum seekers living in Stoke-on-Trent were informed in October that they would no longer be able to report at their local police station\u0026nbspand would instead have to\u0026nbsptravel\u0026nbspmore than 40 miles way to\u0026nbspDallas Court in Salford.One disabled woman got lost in Manchester after getting off at the wrong stop and had to stand in a queue for three hours on crutches. It took her eight hours to get from her accommodation to the reporting location in Salford. The ordeal left her “distressed and very unwell for the next few days”, according to Jude Hawes,\u0026nbspmanager of Stoke’s Citizens Advice Bureau.Another asylum seeker who had no severe mental health problems before he was compelled to report at Dallas Court reportedly\u0026nbspattempted\u0026nbspsuicide due to the distress it caused. He was subsequently admitted to an acute psychiatric ward\u0026nbspfor a month.Others have been unable to get back in time for the\u0026nbspschool pick-up, meaning\u0026nbspthey\u0026nbsphave had to take their children out of school for the day and bring\u0026nbspthem with them.Lawyers said it was “very concerning” and have sent urgent correspondence to the Home Office in the hope that they will reconsider the decision without the need to challenge it in court.Asylum seekers ‘could contribute £42m to UK if allowed to work’The Citizens Advice Bureau in Stoke said there had been a 28 per cent increase in the number of asylum seekers attending the charity’s drop-in sessions for help since the local reporting service was closed.\u0026nbspMr Hawes said: “I can’t tell you how shocked and distressed people have been by this. People who already have very limited financial resources are having to use some of these resources every time they report, and for some people that is weekly.“On top of that, we have some people who are so severely physically disabled, it is literally beyond their capacity to make a journey like this on public transport. Even if your connections are good, it is nearly a three hour journey.“And possibly even more seriously, we have some very mentally unwell clients, who frankly will simply never find their way there.\u0026nbsp“If they fail to report there are serious consequences. It can mean they lose their support, which goes on their record when they are making further applications to the Home Office.”Ms Hawes said that in a meeting organised by the Home Office after the Citizens Advice Bureau made a complaint, officials insisted that the journey was an hour and a half drive – but failed to acknowledge that none of the asylum seekers in Stoke drove or had a car.Other parts of the country have also been affected by closures in recent years, including Portsmouth, central Bristol and Nottingham, with many asylum seekers in these cities having to travel increased distances to report to the Home Office.People awaiting a decision on their application to remain in the UK are required to regularly sign on at their local reporting location. Frequency is determined by the Home Office but is typically set at a weekly, monthly, or six-monthly basis. Each person or family is assigned a day of the week, and a one or two-hour window in which to report.If they arrive before or after this window they will often be turned away or forced to wait. If they fail to notify the Home Office that they will be late or can’t\u0026nbspattend on their assigned day, with sufficient evidence of the reason, they\u0026nbsprisk\u0026nbsplosing the\u0026nbspsupport they are entitled to and being detained.Diane Abbott MP, the\u0026nbspshadow home secretary, said: “It is clear that the decision to move the reporting is causing distress and adding financial hardship to vulnerable asylum seekers.\u0026nbsp“The Home Office cannot simply make changes that affect people’s lives without first assessing the impact. Such measures are yet another display of Tory hostile environment policies.”Gareth Snell, Labour and Co-operative MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, said: “This was a short-sighted decision that shows a complete lack of compassion or consideration for the people who are required to report regularly.“There was no consultation with the third sector organisations that work hard to deal with the challenges faced by people with ongoing applications, which proves there was no real effort to understand the effects of the move to Salford.“The minister’s response to my queries and objections simply are not good enough.”Scott Laing, solicitor at Bhatia Best, who is threatening a judicial review against the decision, said: “It is very concerning that the Home Office have taken the decision to remove the reporting centre in Stoke.\u0026nbsp“This has resulted in vulnerable iniduals, who are in receipt of only basic support to meet their essential living needs, having to travel over 40 miles away.\u0026nbsp“Unfortunately, the Home Office have made clear that each inidual must continue to report. We act for numerous clients who are in this difficult position and urgent correspondence has been sent to the Home Office in the hope that they will reconsider the decision without the need to commence proceedings at court.”Lisa Matthews, of\u0026nbspcampaign group Right to Remain, said: “80,000 people in the UK have to regularly report at their local Home Office immigration centre.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller (centre) welcomes Madrid Mayor Manuela Carmena (left) and London Mayor Sadiq Khan at City Hall in Berlin.

I plucked up the courage to ask them – to say I’m hungry, I have a baby. But they said We can’t give you anything. I had to drink my baby’s milk\u0027Click to followThe IndependentRokhsana Fiaz, mayor of Newham, apologised at the end of the meetingPeople suffering extreme levels of deprivation\u0026nbspin London have told the UN’s poverty envoy how government-inflicted austerity has left them homeless, hungry and at times forced into exploitation.During a packed out-meeting in Newham, east London, Philip Alston heard directly from migrant women, disabled people and domestic abuse survivors, who gave personal accounts of how welfare cuts had affected them.In one highly charged account, a West African mother with a baby strapped to her back explained through tears how she\u0026nbsphad to wait for 20 hours outside social services after fleeing an abusive relationship, during which she became so hungry she had to drink her child’s milk.Other\u0026nbspstories\u0026nbspincluded a mentally unwell man who was fined for making a mistake\u0026nbspon his universal credit application, families with young children forced to live in flea-infested houses and a heavily pregnant woman having to sleep rough in a park.Disadvantaged groups trapped in poverty and excluded from societyHundreds of modern slavery victims in poverty after escaping abuseMore than 14m people in UK living in poverty, major report findsThe UN\u0027s special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspand human rights visited one of the poorest boroughs in the capital as part of his two-week\u0026nbsptour of Britain to investigate the impact of the roll-out of universal credit, child poverty and Brexit on people living there.His visit comes after experts warned the UK had experienced the largest rise in poverty since Margaret Thatcher was in power –\u0026nbspan increase believed to show the extent to which a combination of Brexit and government austerity is imposing a serious squeeze on living standards.Jane Williams, of the Magpie Project, a charity supporting families in temporary accommodation in East London, told Mr Alston of one case where a new mother was placed in a hostel with her three-day-old son.She said women were being “thwarted” in their parenting as local authorities place them in often decrepit housing miles away from their support networks, describing\u0026nbspthese families as a “transient, invisible” population.“Families are being offered Bradford or nothing, that’s to say they if don’t accept being moved away from everything and everyone their children have ever known, they’re deemed to have made themselves intentionally homeless,” she said.“There’s nowhere to play, nowhere to learn to crawl, learning to crawl on the bed because their mum won’t put them on the infested floor. Imagine being thwarted in your parenting, wanting to be the best mum you can, knowing how to, but being unable to because of your circumstances.”One of the mothers the Magpie Project supports, who did not want to be identified in the media, told how she stayed with an abusive partner for months because “he was the only hope of being housed”, adding: “I managed because I didn’t want my baby to be evicted.”Disadvantaged groups trapped in poverty and excluded from societyThe woman, who addressed the meeting with her baby strapped to her back, explained how when she did finally pluck up the courage to escape, the police directed her to social services where she was left waiting outside in the cold with her child for 20 hours with no food.“I was in my slippers, it was so cold. I plucked up the courage to ask them – to say I’m hungry, I have a baby. But they said We can’t give you anything. I had to drink my baby’s milk,” she said.Another woman told how she fled her home country in Africa because her uncle was raping her, but received no support on arriving in Britain with her baby and was subsequently forced to live with a man who sexually abused her because he was prepared to house them.\u0026nbspWhen she finally left him, she said she was given no help from the council, and had to rely on friends and “almost nothing” to live. The woman, who became pregnant with the abusive man’s baby, told of one occasion where she had to sleep rough when she was six months pregnant.Mr Alston also heard stories of mentally and physically disabled people who had been “hounded by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) every day”.One woman, a live-in carer aged 64, reportedly took seven attempts to fill out the universal credit application, which can only be done online.“She had no Wi-Fi at home, she had the use the library, but with library closures impacting our communities it\u0027s incredibly difficult to access benefits,” said a spokesperson for a disability campaign group.“Due to job centre closures across the country, she had to take two bus journeys to get to Bromley. She had to borrow the money from her landlord. Due to payment delays in her claim, she had to borrow money of her landlord to eat. She hadn’t eaten for a week when she came to us.Biggest rise in UK poverty since Thatcher was in power, experts claim“She didn’t get any help from the job centre to pay her travel expenses. She was put into debt and left anxious and stressed.”Another universal credit claimant was reportedly landed with a £15 fine for making a mistake on the application form, and was then told to get a smartphone to more easily handle his claim – but was\u0026nbspunable to afford one.The meeting also heard about the plight of women detained in Yarl’s Wood removal centre, both while they are in the facility and once they are released into the community.“Many of you will have heard what’s happened at the notorious Yarl’s Wood detention centre where women have suffered rape and sexual abuse, but what you don’t always hear is what happened to the women who get out,” said one campaigner.“We have heard women being literally thrown out from the detention centre without a penny to get anywhere in the country, and that is another level abuse that is so hidden, and makes women so vulnerable.The campaigner added: “I’m fed up of people being on trial for being poor.”After hearing the witness statements Newham\u0027s mayor,\u0026nbspRokhsana Fiaz, said: “Can I just apologise on behalf of myself as mayor of Newham, and on behalf of the council that you experienced that treatment at the hands of people that we employ. It shouldn’t have happened.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller (centre) welcomes Madrid Mayor Manuela Carmena (left) and London Mayor Sadiq Khan at City Hall in Berlin.

Thursday morning is now seen as the last chance, if a special EU summit is to be held this month to sign it off.Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Mr Lidington refused – twice – to say that “hand on heart” he believed Britain would better off under the prime minister’s terms for Brexit.Created with Sketch.Tories at war: Boris Johnson \u0027suicide vest\u0027 Brexit jibe causes ide Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Internal isions in the Conservative Party have exploded into a bitter public row over Boris Johnson‘s “disgusting” criticism of Theresa May.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, rebuked his former cabinet colleague and said: “I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences.”But other MPs leapt to Mr Johnson’s defence, as iding lines ahead of a possible leadership contest begin to take shape.

This marks one of the most disgusting moments in modern British politics.

He delivered the Leave vote, Remainers and wannabe future PMs hate him.”Andrew Bridgen said Ms May was to blame for her leadership problems.Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, warned Ms May the Conservatives faced a catastrophic split if she did not jettison her Chequers plan.The deep isions on the Tory benches were laid bare as Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee and is a possible leadership rival to Mr Johnson, also hit out at the former foreign secretary.Alistair Burt, another Foreign Office minister who worked in Mr Johnson’s team, said: “I’m stunned at the nature of this attack.

This was always going to be an extremely difficult, extremely complex negotiation, but we are almost within touching distance now.“But, as the prime minister has said, it can\u0027t be a deal at any price. It has got to be one that works in terms of feeling we can deliver on the referendum result and that is why there is a measure of caution.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Visa policy is coordinated for the whole Schengen passportless area.British travellers could still be inconvenienced by Brexit because the EU is planning to bring in a system where countries outside the bloc will need to apply for an electronic travel authorisation in advance, even if they are visa-exempt.\u0026nbspEtias\u0026nbsp– the EU Travel Information and Authorisation System – is modelled on the US Esta system and is being introduced on security grounds.May forced to call Varadkar to calm Irish anger over borderTheresa May’s cabinet is final block to a Brexit deal, EU states warnTo what extent British citizens will have the right to\u0026nbspwork in the EU or move there long-term are separate to the question of travel visas these questions will be settled as part of the future relationship negotiations between the EU and UK, expected to commence next year.The move on visas is part of the EU’s intensified planning for a possible no-deal Brexit. In a statement, the European Commission said: “The European Commission has today proposed to grant UK citizens visa-free travel to the EU after the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.“It would mean that UK citizens would not need a visa when travelling to the Schengen area for short stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. In the scenario where the UK leaves the EU without a deal, this would apply as of 30 March 2019. If a deal is reached, however, it would apply as of the end of the transition period, as outlined in the withdrawal agreement. This follows the commission’s continued commitment that citizens’ rights must come first in the negotiations on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.“This proposal is entirely conditional upon the UK also granting reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel for all EU member states, in line with the principle of visa reciprocity. The UK government has declared its intention not to require a visa from citizens of the EU27 member states for shorts stays for the purposes of tourism and business. EU rules on non-EU nationals travelling to the EU, such as those on border control, would of course apply to UK citizens once they are no longer EU citizens.”The visa-free policy covers the 22 EU member countries that are members of the Schengen area and the four\u0026nbspSchengen-associated states – Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\u0026nbspIt will also apply to Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Cyprus, which are outside Schengen but coordinate their policies with it.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Mr Trump tweeted.\u0026nbspThese fact-free claims were not endorsed by Ms McSall,\u0026nbspwho has not engaged with\u0026nbspMr Trump’s\u0026nbspvoter fraud theory.Ms Sinema’s victory achieves a long-time Democratic goal of making Arizona a competitive state, becoming the first\u0026nbspDemocratic US senator in the state since 1994.She spoke to reporters at a Scottsdale hotel after\u0026nbspdeclaring\u0026nbspvictory in the wake of the concession by her opponent.Ms Sinema said she would follow the example of the late Senator John McCain, who died in August, and\u0026nbspwould try to follow his example and “put country before party.”\u0026nbspMs\u0026nbspSinema\u0026nbsptailored her campaign for conservative-leaning Arizona rather than the national environment, but it may be a guide for Democrats who hope to expand the electoral map in 2020.She chose not to criticise Mr Trump\u0027s hardline\u0026nbspimmigration stance and painted herself as a non-partisan problem solver.\u0026nbspDuring her six years in Congress, Ms\u0026nbspSinema\u0026nbspbuilt one of most centrist records in the Democratic caucus, and she voted for bills backed by Mr Trump more than 60 per cent of the time.

This will not be an agreement at any cost.Any deal must ensure we take back control of our laws, borders and money. It must secure the ability to strike new trade deals around the world.And it must also be a deal that protects jobs, our security and our precious Union.Brexit news: Theresa May has sent the EU a dire warning (Image: )The PM\u0027s spokesman said: We have made good progress in the negotiations in relation to the withdrawal agreement but there are substantial issues still to be overcome in relation to the Northern Irish backstop.Former transport minister Jo Johnson yesterday said he decided to quit Mrs May\u0027s Government last week because he was concerned at reports she was planning a publicity campaign which he said amounted to a calculated deceit.I challenge the Government to come clean on the cost of Brexit, he said.The reason they can\u0027t look us in the eye, it\u0027s because they know this will leave us worse-off and with less control. It\u0027s a gross abuse of civil service impartiality.Mr Johnson added: There is a sea-change in mood among my Conservative colleagues who are focused by this crisis. I would not be surprised if more colleagues in senior positions speak out.

While the cigar-shaped asteroid passed through our solar system, scientists began theorising that asteroids could have come from far away and then stayed. Experts have still been debating the discovery, and a newer theory from experts at Harvard\u0027s Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, Shmuel Bialy and Abraham Loeb, said that \u0026lsquoOumuamua may have been sent by aliens to survey other galaxies.                Astronomers claim Oumuamua is ALIEN PROBE scientists can learn from                NASA asteroid WARNING: Asteroid will pass Earth closer than MoonProfessor Loeb told Universe Today: We explain the excess acceleration of \u0026lsquoOumuamua away from the sun as the result of the force that the sunlight exerts on its surface.For this force to explain measured excess acceleration, the object needs to be extremely thin, of order a fraction of a millimetre in thickness but tens of meters in size.This makes the object lightweight for its surface area and allows it to act as a light sail.Its origin could be either natural (in the interstellar medium or proto-planetary disks) or artificial (as a probe sent for a reconnaissance mission into the inner region of the solar system).However, the astronomer who discovered the asteroid, Robert Weryk, has criticised the alien theory, calling it \u0026ldquowild and \u0026ldquoexotic.\u0026lsquoOumuamua asteroid: Discoverer of \u0026lsquoalien\u0026rsquo space rock breaks silence over ET theory (Image:  \u0026bull NASA)Mr Weryk told CBC\u0027s Afternoon Drive: \u0026ldquoI think it\u0027s a remnant from another solar system. It\u0027s just something that happened to run into us, and we were very lucky to have been operating the telescope that night and looking in that direction.It\u0027s been theoretically predicted for decades but we\u0027ve never seen one. Until we see another one, there are a lot of questions that we just can\u0027t answer.Other astronomers have also criticised Prof Loeb\u0026rsquos theory.Alan Fitzsimmons, an astrophysicist at Queens University, Belfast, recently said: Like most scientists, I would love there to be convincing evidence of alien life, but this isn\u0027t it.Some claimed it was an alien messenger (Image: )\u0026ldquoIt has already been shown that its observed characteristics are consistent with a comet-like body ejected from another star system.And some of the arguments in this study are based on numbers with large uncertainties.Katie Mack, an astrophysicist at North Carolina State, also had an issue with the theory.She wrote on Twitter: The thing you have to understand is: scientists are perfectly happy to publish an outlandish idea if it has even the tiniest sliver of a chance of not being wrongThe journey of \u0027Oumuamua (Image: NASA)\u0026ldquoBut until every other possibility has been exhausted dozen times over, even the authors probably don\u0027t believe it.The bizarre cigar-shaped space rock is believed to have been wandering among the stars for hundreds of millions of years and it is the first foreign object to be spotted in our solar system.\u0026lsquoOumuamua is about 400 metres long and is a dark red colour and was spotted by the Pan-STARRS1 telescope in Hawaii on October 19, 2017, travelling at about 95,000 kilometres per hour.

Tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) define the volume of sensitive goods, such as meat and cheese, that other World Trade Organisation (WTO) members can export to Europe. They set the amounts of goods that can be imported at low or zero tariffs, as opposed to full WTO rates that can often exceed 100 percent.                \u0027It\u0027s Britain versus EU!\u0027 UK Fishermen FURIOUS at Brussels over quotas                EU kickstart CRUCIAL Brexit talks to decide Britain\u0027s WTO futureLast year, Brussels and London came up with a joint plan that involved iding the current quotas based on consumption patterns.This means the UK would take a larger quota for products such as New Zealand lamb, where it accounts for much of the European Union demand.Both parties want endorsement of the plan from the WTO before Brexit takes effect from March 29, 2019.But the group of countries used Monday\u0026rsquos meeting in Geneva to complain they would still lose out because the quota splits would reduce flexibility for exporters used to exporting to a single 28-country market.EU news: The US are one of many countries objecting to the EU\u0027s quota plans post-Brexit (Image: )One official told the Financial Times that Australia warned at the meeting splitting TRQs risked being too small to be commercially viable, while the US rejected the proposals on the basis that exporters would be worse off.A group of 12 countries, also including China, Brazil and Mexico, put together a draft note before yesterday\u0026rsquos meeting outlining what they thought were the problems with the EU plan, in addition to other nations raising their concerns.The rejection of the plan is the latest blow for the EU and a sign of his big trade powers are intensifying their demands over the UK\u0026rsquos imminent exit from the bloc should be managed - both short and long-term.Both parties have been working together over recent months around how to share out the TRQs, which are particularly valuable to agricultural exporters such as Argentina and New Zealand, and also the powerful farm lobby in the US.It is also a hugely important issue for Brussels and London, as the result of talks will determine how much competition farmers from within the EU and specifically the UK will face.But failure to find a solution at the WTO over how to split the TRQs could ever trigger legal challenges from several of the EU\u0026rsquos trading partners.

Now the Tories say “repeat offenders convicted under the ‘two strikes’ rule are  per cent more likely to go to prison than in ”.So it’s “two strikes and you’re slightly more likely to be jailed than before”.No wonder gang members brazenly carry machetes.It’s not just policing that needs radical change — and we welcome Sajid Javid’s claim that signicant new funding is just weeks away.It’s that our courts must get tougher, as a deterrent and to get murderous thugs off the streets.QUELLE surprise! The EU reckons Britain’s economic prospects are worse than those of anyone in its club.And its Remainer stooges pop up like automated bots to carp about their own country being “the sick man of Europe”.That’s the same Europe which has youth unemployment at ,  and . per cent in Spain, Italy and France, compared with our ..

But it will be flawed –– and Mrs May should say so.I admit this sounds odd: Why would a Prime Minister admit that a deal they have negotiated isn’t great ButMrs May tries to say that this agreement is perfect, and that there is no risk of any part of the UK getting stuck in the backstop — which would leave it in an EU customs union but with no say over the trade deals the EU is doing — then she will easily be disproved.Mrs May should take a leaf out of the book of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who as a hugely successful trial lawyer knows a fair bit about persuading people of his case.He told Cabinet on Tuesday that when it came to quitting the backstop “a unilateral right would give the UK greater scope to establish its case, as the other side would have to prove the contrary”.But he went on to acknowledge that negotiating a unilateral right to get out of the backstop was highly unlikely in the time available and a mutual review mechanism could be made to work.Cox’s essential argument is about managing risk. Every option on Brexit now carries with it risk.The challenge is to work out how to best manage these risks. The risk with accepting a legally binding backstop in the withdrawal agreement is that the UK ends up being unable to get out of it cleanly.It would be direthe UK ended up leaving the EU in a way that tied it to the EU for ever.But set against this must be the risk of no deal, and the disruption that would cause. To make matters worse, the Government has done absurdly little to mitigate no deal.The reason that even Cabinet ministers who loathe where the negotiations are heading do not want to go for no deal is they know how unprepared the country is for it.At the same time, there is a risk thatthere is no deal, Parliament would either insist on a second referendum — that would harden isions and toxy our politics — or cancel the process altogether, creating a dangerous democratic deficit.Frankly, the argument that Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement is less bad than the alternatives will be pretty much the only thing going for it.It will be hard for her to make this argument as so many of the deal’s problems are self-inflicted.She triggered Article  without knowing what the UK wanted she has wasted much of the past  months in a negotiation with her own Cabinet the failure to plan properly for no deal has weakened the Government’s negotiating position.Even the Parliamentary arithmetic has been made worse by Mrs May. If she hadn’t called that election, there would be a Tory majority and she wouldn’t be so reliant on the DUP.But it is the argument that her deal is less bad than the alternatives that is keeping the Cabinet on board and it is her best — and, possibly, only — way of getting the House of Commons to vote for such a flawed agreement.THE bad news for Theresa May is that it doesn’t get any easier once she’s got a deal with Brussels.For she will still have to get this withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons.With the DUP unhappy and  Tory Brexit ultras expected to vote against the deal, as well as Jo Johnson and other Tories who want another referendum, it will be extremely tough to get it over the line.“I can’t quite see where the majority comes from,” admits one Cabinet minister.But there is growing talk that the way to get the deal through might be to bring it back a second time, with the markets – which expect a deal – freaking out.As this Secretary of State says: “Do you get it through the first time  Maybe not.He did little to hide his irritation at being moved from his job as universities minister because of his opposition to Mrs May’s plan to tinker with tuition fees.But his resignation is a blow to the PM – and not just because of his attack on her for “a failure of British statecraft not seen since the Suez crisis”.His departure will put more pressure on those ministerial colleagues who privately share his view that a second referendum is needed, to go.With both Johnsons voting against the withdrawal agreement, it will become even harder to get it through the Commons.SO will any of the Cabinet resign over Theresa May’s Brexit plan  At the moment, ministers believe not.One of those who spoke against the May approach at Cabinet tells me the mood of the meeting was “resigned rather than resigning”.Another predicts critics of what Mrs May is doing “will make their point, then retreat”.This is not to say people are happy. Penny Mordaunt, the International Development Secretary, warned that voters wanted a “definitive end point to Brexit” andthey didn’t get it, that risked “feeding a narrative of betrayal, fuelling Ukip”.In private, ministers rail against Mrs May and the way she is handling the negotiations. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been heard to complain that the UK is making it far too obvious it is in a desperate hurry to get a deal.It is certainly true that by advertising its need for a quick agreement, the UK is almost inviting the EU to ask for more.Tellingly, there is renewed – and increasing – talk among ministers of having a new leader in place to do the next set of negotiations.There is little love for the backstop. And interestingly, Chancellor Philip Hammond argued in Cabinet this week it would be better to extend the transition than trigger the backstop.He argued that the backstop could do damage to supply chains and said “it could be better to extend the implementation period than have a bad backstop”.A problem with extending the implementation period is that it would mean free movement would continue – and the UK would still be sending huge amounts of money to Brussels every year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink. Still, they are yet to speak out – or apologise.What beggars belief is not just that these sick men thought that no one would notice nor care when this footage emerged on social media – but really that they are unhinged enough to do it in the first place.I’m pretty sure about one thing, though. No matter what consequences they will face for their actions from the law, they will never, ever live this down in the eyes of the world – and nor should they.I’m talking about Michael Douglas, . When he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for more than  years in the entertainment industry, he gave his father, Kirk, a kiss on the lips to celebrate.In my experience there comes an age when your kids don’t want to kiss you – particularly on the lips and particularly your dad.It’s part and parcel of growing up that your kids don’t even want you to breathe, let alone kiss them.In fact, everything you do embarrasses them.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It should include common development of arms industry, she said as well as an EU-wide arms export policy and crucially a European intervention force.It came a day after a senior minister from the French Government called for the EU to become a powerful new “empire” to rival the US and China in an interview which will infuriate Donald Trump.Merkels remarks today in the EU parliament drew loud applause in the legislature but also boos from euro-sceptic members.One of them was chief Brexiteer Nigel Farage, who said: Its a European Union that we are told is now to become an empire - a militarised European Union.A European Union that has launched a new Cold against the United States of America.One hundreds years on from the Armistice we should genuinely be worried.The idea that this new militarised union is somehow a recipe for peace I suggest you sit back and think a little bit more carefully.Maybe you should all re-read history because the European project was set up to stop German domination and what you have seen today is a naked take-over bid.Yesterday French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said Europe must be strong enough to defend itself in the future - words the US president called insulting.Le Maire controversial calls for a new superstate came as he backed Macron’s and Merkels plan for a “real European army”.Le Maire suggested Brussels should go one even further and establish itself as an “empire”.Its about Europe having to become a kind of Empire, as China is. And how the US is, the French finance minister told the German newspaper Handelsblatt.After being quizzed by the newspaper on his comments, he added: “Do not get me wrong, Im talking about a peaceful empire thats a constitutional state.I use the term to raise awareness that the world of tomorrow will be about power.Power will make a dference: technological power, economic, financial, monetary, cultural power will be crucial.Trump has blasted Macrons idea for the European Union to build an army to protect itself from the US as insulting.The US President tweeted: President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia.Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the US subsidises greatly!It comes three days after the French President said the US is as big a threat to the EU as Russia and China and called for a “true European army” to defend the bloc.In an extraordinary attack on the US president, Macron lumped Washington together with Moscow and Beijing as Europe’s biggest foes.The arch euro federalist insisted only a fully fledged EU defence force can protect the continent against the trio’s aggression.He said: “We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.“We will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army.”The French president lashed Mr Trump for deciding to pull the US out of a nuclear treaty with Russia that was signed during the Cold War.He raged: “When I see President Trump announcing that he’s quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim  Europe and its security.”Mr Macron made the comments in a radio interview from the town of Verdun - the site of a major WW battle - as he tours the Western Front ahead of Remembrance Day.They were welcomed by the EU Commission, which said it has already put the wheels in motion for the eventual creation of a euro army.A spokesman beamed: “If there is a Commission that has put forward the need for a meaningful defence identity for the EU, it’s this Commission.“President Macron has been consistently putting forward this narrative for a stronger Europe that empowers and protects.“This is totally totally compatible with our work and all contributions from our EU leaders, and especially from President Macron, are very much welcome.”But the remarks were savaged by former British Army commanders, who said the revelations showed why the UK must pull out of the EU’s defence plans.Major General Julian Thompson, who led British forces in the Falklands, told The Sun: “The EU Commission now openly admits it has created the preamble to an EU army.The UK is in that preamble and risks being kept in it.“Ministers must withdraw or risk losing forever whole chunks of the UK’s democratic control over defence.”Colonel Richard Kemp, a commander of UK troops in Afghanistan, added: “This is precisely what eurosceptics have been warning about.“It is time for ministers now to take notice and rein in what they have agreed since the referendum.They have been led astray in the most crucial area of sovereignty.”And Tory MEP Geoffrey Van Orden, a former British Army Brigadier, raged: “Instead of th century dreams of French-led European grandeur, President Macron should be helping build Western solidarity.“That means helping and not obstructing a strong partnership with Britain and strengthening the NATO alliance.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000248408276.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brits wont need a visa to travel to europe even if we get a no deal brexit eu confirms","story":"UK citizens will be able to visit the EU for up to three months at a time without having to get new documents -

There were . million EU nationals working in the UK from July to September, , fewer than a year earlier. The Office for National Statistics said this was the largest yearly fall since records began in . ONS experts tried to calm talk of a Brexodus - stressing that the estimates do not measure flows of recent migrants to the UK.Jonathan Portes, professor of economics at Kings College London, pointed the finger at Brexit and warned of signicant negative impacts for the NHS and social care.The prospect of Brexit has clearly made the UK a much less attractive place for Europeans to live and work, he declared.  The Resolution Foundation think tank warned the figures show Britains labour market is already changing ahead of Brexit day on  March . Expert Stephen Clarke said: Firms who employ a large share of migrant workers need to think now about adjusting to a lower migration environment, in terms of the workers they employ, what they produce and how they operate. A sharp drop has been fuelled by a decrease from eight east European countries that joined the EU in . The figures show , of the EU workers employed in the UK in the latest quarter were citizens of the so-called EUA states, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. This was , fewer than in the equivalent period of last year.  The number of EUA employees is down by , compared with July-September , just after the EU referendum, when it stood at a record level of more than a million. It came despite a rise in the number of workers from the rest of the world. There were . million non-EU nationals working in the UK in July to September, , more than  months earlier. And the drop was not reflected in  other EU states. There were , nationals of  long-term EU member states including Germany, Italy, Spain and France working in the UK, a slight increase on , a year earlier. Ministers are preparing to finally unveil proposals for the post-Brexit immigration regime before the end of the year.  A white paper is expected to set out plans for a system which brings an end to free movement and prioritises higher-skilled workers. But Lib Dem MP Ed Davey claimed: Even before we’ve left the EU, we’re seeing a Brexodus that is bad for British businesses and especially bad for our public services. Alp Mehmet, vice chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the figures were good news. Todays figures showed both unemployment and employment are on the rise. Unemployment has increased by , to .million but employment also rose by ,, to a record high of .million. ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes said: The labour market is little changed on the previous three months, though still stronger than it was at this time last year. With faster wage growth and more subdued inflation, real earnings have picked up noticeably in the last few months. However, real wage growth is below the level seen in , and real wages have not yet ed to their  levels. The recent uptick in British nationals in work and the decline in workers from the so-called A Eastern European countries both seem to be accelerating.

During a Commons debate yesterday, Business Minister Kelly Tolhurst was askedNorthern Ireland and the Republic could end up one hour apart.  She did not rule it out, instead saying: At the moment this is why were having this debate We are as a United Kingdom... working with other member states. We are joined with others who are against this proposal. And there are some other member states who have yet to give their firm position on whether they want to accept or not this proposal. So of course the time zone is a reserve for Great Britain.  And we would obviouslywe were ever in a position where we would need to change clocks, we would consult widely before any decision was made in the United Kingdom.Labour MP Stella Creasy warned there was a very real risk thatshes not successful, they could face dferent time zones across that border.And Labour MP Darren Jones tweeted: Minister not sure what this will mean for dferent time in Northern Ireland compared to Ireland. #BrexitShambles October : No Deal preparations have to begin no matter what, because otherwise they wont be ready on time. November : The UK was hoping for a final Brexit summit to seal not just a deal, but a political declaration on future trade. However, this looked off the cards as talks stalled over the Northern Irish border. - December : The next scheduled European Council summit. This is the last chance saloon to get a deal. Already its much later than was ideal. Otherwise there wont be time to sign it off before Brexit Day. After a deal is reached: MPs hold a vote on any deal in Parliament. This is danger moment two for Theresa May, who will likely face a Tory leadership challengeshe loses the vote. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But talk has been floated of extending this by a few months. After December : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. For more information read our guide to whats happening with the Brexit talks and  ways No Deal Brexit will affect your le. The EUs plans have left the UK in an unusual deadlock. UK officials are racing to try and block the EUs proposal before Brexit on  March . If that doesnt happen, there are fears the change could happen during a Brexit transition period - forcing the UK to go along with the rest of the EU against its will. But questions remain over what happensthe change comes after a transition period, orthere is no transition period at all. Ms Tolhurst said: We are still hopeful we will be able to block this proposal.

Brussels unveiled the key policy as part of contingency planstheres no deal on  March . Officials had discussed making the UK a third country - forcing travellers to pay  Eurosfor an entry permit. But EC vice president Frans Timmermans today said that will be waived - as long as the UK gives EU citizens the same privilege. He told a Tuesday press conference in Strasbourg: On visas we propose to amend the visa regulation to allow UK nationals to be exempt from any visa requirement for short stays in the EU once EU law stops applying to the UK.But of course an important point: this is entirely conditional on the UK also doing the same thing for EU nationals, reciprocating.  A document released by the Commission says the rules would apply to Britons travelling to Schengen Area nations, which includes all western European EU members states and eastern ones including Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It would apply to trips of up to  days within any -day period, starting from March  in the event of a no-deal Brexit and from the end of any transition perioda deal is achieved. Adding to Mr Timmermans remarks, it also says: This proposal is entirely conditional upon the UK also granting reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel for all EU Member States, in line with the principle of visa reciprocity.  The UK government has declared its intention not to require a visa from citizens of the EU Member States for shorts stays for the purposes of tourism and business. EU rules on non-EU nationals travelling to the EU, such as those on border control, would of course apply to UK citizens once they are no longer EU citizens. The Commission urged the European Parliament and Council to back the change quickly so that it can be adopted in good time before  March .

Action on Sugar is pushing for the monstrous milkshakes - often topped with whipped cream and everything from full-size chocolate bars to mini-doughnuts - to be scrapped from menus. The group says Toby Carverys Unicorn Freakshake - containing an alarming  teaspoons of sugar and , calories - topped a list of milkshakes served at restaurants and fast food outlets in the UK. Five Guys banana and chocolate milkshake had  teaspoons of sugar and , calories, the campaigners claim.  Its cherry mix-in ranked third, with  teaspoons of sugar and  calories, according to Action on Sugar. Thirty-nine teaspoons of sugar is more than six times the recommended amount of sugar for a -year-old and more than four cans of Coke. Action on Sugar said the surveys findings revealed grotesque levels of sugar and calories and called for a ban on all milkshakes that exceeded  calories per serving. Public Health England is looking to companies to reduce the amount of sugar in their products by  per cent by . But Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of Action on Sugar, said the cuts should go further. He said: These very high calorie drinksconsumed on a daily basis, would result in children becoming obese and suffer from tooth decay - that is not acceptable.  Despite milkshakes being incorporated into the Public Health EnglandsSugar Reduction Programme as part of the governments childhood obesity plan, it is clear from our survey that much more needs to be done than a  per cent reduction. These high calorie milkshakes need to be reduced immediately below the kcal per serving. Kawther Hashem, a researcher at Action on Sugar based at Queen Mary University of London, said: Undoubtedly some of these milkshakes contribute to excess sugar and calorie intake, and it is shocking this information is hidden from the consumer, who would struggle to find it. It is time the government introduced legislation to force companies to be more transparent about what is in their products by displaying clear nutrition information online and in the outlets, at all times. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: Milkshakes can contain signicant amounts of sugar - consuming too much sugar contributes to children leaving primary school overweight or obese, and suffering with tooth decay. The food and drink industry - including restaurants, manufacturers and retailers - has a key role in helping to tackle this by reducing the amount of sugar we buy and consume, and we hope to see them step up to the challenge. A Toby Carvery spokesperson said: “Freakshakes only feature on our main menu and are not targeted at children. “We share our nutritional information online for guests to access and we are very mindful of our role in helping guests’ make informed decisions about what they eat and drink while dining with us. “We also regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes and have also committed to the Public Health England Sugar Reduction programme.has contacted Five Guys for comment.

While the majority of us will spend the day stuffing our faces, lounging on the sofa and arguing with relatives over Monopoly, its a much more formal occasion for the royals. And there is one tradition that is very dferent in the Royal Household: opening presents. Instead of running downstairs on Christmas morning, theres a good chance Prince George and Princess Charlotte wont actually open their presents on the big day. As millions of children across the UK make wrapping paper mountains across their living room carpets, George, Charlotte and Louis family will be preparing to go to a church service at Sandringham.  The entire royal family traditionally spends Christmas and New Year at Sandringham, the Queens country estate in Norfolk. It hasnt always been that way. When the Queens children - Charles, Anne, Andrew and Edward - were small, Christmases were spent at Windsor Castle. But in  when the castle was being rewired, the family uprooted to Sandringham and the festive season has been spent there ever since. The royal family normally open their presents on Christmas Eve, a legacy of the German heritage of the monarchy. Former royal chef Darren McGrady said: The royals are of German descent so they weave in German traditions to their celebrations. After afternoon tea, they open gts on Christmas Eve, as is the German tradition.  So the Cambridge children will have already opened their presents before most other British kids. Its possible that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will give them some presents to open on Christmas Day, too - or theyll receive some from extended family. But Prince William might want to carry on the tradition hes grown up with of opening gts on Christmas Eve. And, of course, present giving in the royal household isnt as simple as writing a gt tag and leaving it under the tree. Presents are placed on a white linen-covered trestle table in the red drawing room, with cards marking exactly where the piles of gts should be put. Tapes mark out sections for each family member and any of the Queens household who is on duty for the weekend.  Prince Louis will be celebrating his first Christmas this year as he was born in April. Prince George was delighted last Christmas after Santa got him the one present he really wanted. The prince, then four years old, requested a toy police car from Father Christmas. His dad, Prince William, delivered the handwritten letter in person on a trip to Helsinki in November. William explained there was much excitement when George got his toy car at Sandringham. And as for the adults in the royal family, what do you buy the people who have everything   Well, it turns out the royals tend to buy each other jokey presents rather than serious gts. Princess Anne once gave Charles a white leather loo seat, William gave Philip a gumboot-shaped soap, and Harry bought his grandmother a shower cap emblazoned with the words “Aint le a bitch ” And one Christmas, Kate gave Prince Harry, a plastic grow your own girlfriend kit.\u2028 "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles nude tights baffling","story":"NewsMeghan Markles nude tights are baffling people - and theres a bizarre reason whyRoyal fans noticed something rather a little unusual about an outfit Meghan Markle wore over Remembrance weekendShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  NOV NewsMeghan Markle attended the annual Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall over the weekend \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSince bursting onto the scene when her royal relationship with Prince Harry was confirmed, Meghan Markle has become somewhat of a style icon. Women across the globe are desperate to copy her looks and get their hands on whatever clothes she wears. Dubbed the Duchess effect her outfits usually sell out within hours of her being photographed in them. But even the most fashion forward of people can still slip up sometimes - something the Duchess of Sussex proved to be true over the weekend.  The expectant mother accompanied her husband and other family members to the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday November . On first glance the -year-old looked incredibly chic in a black Stella McCartney coat dress, which cleverly hid her baby bump thanks to a big bow. She wore her dark hair down, tucked behind her ears and paired the dress with a black clutch and heels. But people couldnt help notice that something about her ensemble was a little odd - and its all to do with her tights.  Meghan, who has famously opted to forgo wearing hosiery thus far, decided to put on a pair of shiny, nude tights for the event. And many people on social media were bemused by the way they looked. One person wrote: Meghan rewearing her fab Stella McCartney coat from Cardf visit, but I cannot get over the glare of these tights. Another said: What has happened to Meghan Markles tights  Has she spilt her wine   However others found this criticism incredibly offensive and highlighted how dficult it can be to find tights that match your skin colour. I feel so sorry for Meghan Markle because her every move is scrutinized because shes American, a commoner older and biracial. Now they are talking about her nude colour tights. They dont exactly match her skin tone. Well, this is a COMMON problem for women of colour, argued one Twitter user. Another added: Do we really have nothing better to talk about on Remembrance Day than Meghans tights  This isnt the first time the duchess has come under fire for her choice of hosiery.  In May, she wore a similar pair of tights to Prince Charles th birthday party at Buckingham Palace and was also criticised for them. She has since been seen stepping out in public with bare legs. Some have suggested that the decision to cover her skin may not have been her own - as it is commonly thought that the Queen has an unwritten rule about guests and family members wearing tights at royal events.However Marlene Koenig, royal expert and Royal Musings blog founder, told BAZAAR this isnt actually true.She said: There are no rules for royal women regarding pantyhose. While most womenwear pantyhouse with suits or gowns for a good slim line, it is not required by any decree from the Queen. What do you think of Meghans tights  Let us know in the comments below.

In subsequent days, she felt so alone as her daughter fought for le in neonatal intensive care and she recovered from her C-section.I was trying to walk around, Becky told .All Abdou could do was feel guilty because he couldnt do anything.I had three women on the ward. Their husbands were coming in and out and when the baby would cry, youd see them go to the baby. Everyone  had this perfect little family and mine had been torn apart.

Becky kept going back and forth between the UK and Morocco before being offered a job with the company she had been volunteering for.

His face was petried and then a smile broke out bless him, she said.We sat there for about an hour, unsure what to do or say. We then started looking into hospitals in Morocco.Based on their research - and their own experience of hospitals in the country - the couple decided Becky shouldto Britain.Abdou said, As much as I want to be with you, just go home and make sure you and baby are healthy, the mum told us.  However, she was left distraught after she and Abdou applied for a tourist visa for him for Alias birth - only for it to be rejected.I found out in February it had been rejected, via email, said Becky, who flew back to see Abdou once during her pregnancy. I just broke down. I didnt eat for the next four days.I know thats really bad, but I was so stressed. She added: I never thought it would be so strict. He deserves to be here.A couple of months later, at  weeks pregnant, Becky went to hospital after noticing her unborn baby hadnt moved all day. She ended up being raced into theatre after Alias heartbeat suddenly started dropping, while her pal made an urgent call to Abdou.It happened in seconds, doctors and nurses rushed in, she said.My friend went outside and called Abdou. The doctor said, We need to get straight to theatre. I replied, I need someone, I need someone.  While her fianceacute was overseas, her own mum was a two-hour drive away. I spoke to Abdou on a WhatsApp call, Becky said.I said, They have just cut my stomach open. The connection went in and out. I saw a head as they lted her out, but I couldnt hear anything. She added: He was being so brave on the call. Hes been my rock. Alia, who was born two weeks early on April , weighing lbs, oz, was resuscitated before being rushed out of the room by doctors.She subsequently underwent an urgent blood transfusion, with doctors telling Becky her babys iron levels were less than half what they should be. Following her birth in Essex, Alias weight dropped to lbs, oz.Since then, the little girl has been discharged from hospital, but has battled numerous health issues including blood in her stools and hypothermia. She has also struggled to keep milk down. Weve still got no idea what it is, said Becky, who ended up having to lt and carry her child while recovering from her C-section.  Over the past seven months, Alia has undergone regular tests to measure her iron levels. Next month, her parents will receive further test results. But yet again, Becky faces getting these results alone, without her partner. Im just really angry and frustrated, she said. Im so scared that Alia is going to grow up hating me. I want to be able to say I did everything in my power [to get Abdou over here]. In future, shell start asking Why isnt my daddy here  I want daddy. She added: I have seen Abdou once in the last  months now. The thing keeping us going is knowing that one day something will change. We Skype dailywe can. Were a Skype family. Abdou - who is qualied in building and construction and fluent in English - is currently working full-time in a call centre, according to Becky. But although he works at least  hours a week, he reportedly only earns the equivalent of around pound a month, leaving him with little spare. Becky has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the costs of her and Abdous legal battle to get him to the UK to be with his family. In a post on the page, she reveals that they hope to apply for a fianceacute and spouse visa next year under exceptional circumstances. However, she says the costs of doing so are into the thousands.She estimates that she and Abdou will have to fork out at least pound, for him to move to the UK and stay there - in addition to lawyer fees. She adds in the post: I am currently looking for a job that pays over the pound.k minimum income requirement but will also be juggling rent along with bills and childcare and looking at the fees head on now makes me wonder whether Ill ever be able to have my family together in one place. At present, Alia is too poorly to fly out to Morocco to see her dad. But even in the future, Becky says she and Abdou would much rather live in England for their daughters healthcare, education and future prospects. If we go to Morocco she will be at a serious disadvantage and I dont want to take any unnecessary risks with her healthit can be avoided, she says. She hopes that, one day, her family will be together permanently. He has a right to be with his daughter, she told . And she has a right to meet her dad.

The animal, which has been named Shadow, is now being looked after by RSPCA staff, who say it is the first sighting theyre aware of in  years. The impressive-looking fox was found at the weekend in Alsager, Cheshire, and captured by a former RSPCA inspector, who found out about Shadow on Facebook.He is now being looked after at the charity’s Stapeley Grange Wildle Centre in Nantwich, Cheshire Live reports.Amanda Lovett, who worked for the charity before setting up Alsager-based cattery Mere Moggies Boarding, said: “I was alerted to a post on a local Facebook group and it would seem the fox had been in the garden for most of the day.  This was on Saturday, one of the biggest nights for fireworks, and we knew we had to get the fox to safety. “I managed to safely catch the fox with a grasper and put him in a cat box before taking him to Stapeley Grange, who kindly stayed open later so he could be admitted. “He was very quiet and seemed tame.” The fox, which has no microchip, is currently being looked after by staff there while his owners are traced. Lee Stewart, manager of Stapeley Grange, said: “It is likely that Shadow has been kept as a pet and he has either escaped, in which case we need to find his owners, or he has been dumped by his owners.  “He was checked over by our team of vets and was found to be in good health, just a little overweight. He is eating fine and seems to be doing well. “He is the first silver fox we have ever had here at Stapeley Grange, in nearly  years we have been open. He is an impressive-looking animal and it has been interesting to us all to have such a rare admission.” If no owner can be traced, Shadow will be looked to be rehomed with a specialist owner. Silver foxes are the same species as the red foxes we have living wild in the UK but with dferent colouration. Silver foxes are bred for their fur but are now sometimes kept as ‘pets’. The RSPCA advises anyone thinking of getting a pet to fully research the animal’s specic needs before making a decision. Exotic pets can live a long time, grow to a large size and need to be taken an exotics vetthey become ill, which can be expensive.  Foxes are wild animals with very specic needs no dferent to foxes living in the wild and they require specialist care.Even the most experienced fox experts have had dficulty keeping adult foxes successfully. Therefore, the RSPCA does not advise or condone keeping foxes as pets. The RSPCA is a charity and relies on public donations to exist. It costs the centre pound, to feed the , animals which are admitted every year.Anyone who would like to support the vital work of Stapeley Grange can now donate online."},{"url":null,"title":"woman went through menopause 25","story":"NewsWoman went through menopause at  without realising - after missing these signsCrystal Ashwood, now , tried despite articially inseminating herself three times in her bathroom after using Facebook to find a sperm donorShareCommentsByAbigail OLearyRosa McMahon:,  NOV NewsCrystal went through years of irregular periods before being told she would never have her own biological children \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman who says she was born to be a mum was devastated to learn she went through the menopause at  after three desperate articial insemination attempts. Crystal Ashwood, now , used Facebook to find sperm donors and attempted to impregnate herself in her bathroom using a syringe. But last month, the Lidl shop assistant was given the news that she had premature oian failure and would never carry her own biological child. Now fundraising to have embryo donation, she said: Women go through the menopause at double the age I had mine, which is just so unfair. “All my le I have dreamed of being a mum. I can wait for a boyfriend, but I can’t wait for a baby.”  When Crystal’s menstrual cycle started wildly fluctuating at  - leaving her with without a period for up to six months at a time - at first, she thought it was stress-related. Even her GP thought it was because of her lestyle and suggested she lost weight but, despite shedding lb from her size  frame, Crystal’s periods kept disappearing, before coming back heavier than ever. After two years of her periods following this hugely irregular pattern, aged  she was referred for an ultrasound at Musgrove Park Hospital in nearby Taunton, but the results were normal. Following the scan, her periods ed, but were ridiculously heavy.  Crystal said. “They were so heavy I’d have to wear two or three pads and change them every few hours. “I thought I was ok and just hoped the periods would stay.” Her prayers were answered when she began to have a normal menstrual cycle, which continued until a year ago. By then, having saved enough to buy a house, her yearning for motherhood and putting down roots intensied, even though she was single. “I was  and felt like I was getting on a bit,” she said. “All my friends had kids, so I wanted to be in that place, too. I didn’t have a fella, but knew I could find one at any point, whereas I couldn’t have kids at any point.”  And, bravely, thinking her period woes were behind her, in June this year Crystal started looking on Facebook for a sperm donor. “I found a bloke on a Facebook donor page, who lived in the south west area,” Crystal said. “We talked a bit, met for coffee and he agreed to help me. All he wanted was a cup of tea when he arrived at my house, before we tried the articial insemination at home.” Then, three times over the next three months, Crystal’s donor deposited his sperm into a pot in her bathroom, before she collected it and used a needleless syringe to insert its contents into her vagina. But, tragically, for Crystal, each time she took a pregnancy test, just one single line appeared, not the magic two indicating she was expecting. She said: “I really hoped it would work, and my periods had stopped again, so I was even more hopeful that it might be my time to be a mum. “But every time I was disappointed.”  At a loss, Crystal decided to visit a private fertility clinic where, last month, she had Anti-Muumlllerian Hormonetesting with a blood test. According to the NHS, AMH is produced by small follicles - pouches which contain the eggs - growing in the oy. The level of AMH reflects how many follicles are growing - in turn indicating how many eggs are present in the oy. The number of eggs declines with age, until the menopause, when the supply runs out. When Crystals test results showed she had premature oian failure, where a womans periods stop before the age of  – rather than the usual menopausal age of  to . She explained: “They don’t know what causes the condition but said it had left me with just . per cent of my eggs, when most women of  have  to  per cent.”  Advising her that she had most probably gone through the menopause when her periods first stopped, aged , the doctor broke the news that the chances of motherhood with a biological child were over for her. “My dream came crashing down,” she recalled, tearfully. “I was devastated that I would never be able to have my own biological child. I could carry one, but I would need an egg and sperm donor to do it. “All I ever wanted was to buy a house, marry and have a family. Every woman thinks she can just have children, no problem, but I’d had the menopause at half the age most women go through it, it just didn’t feel fair.” After allowing herself a few weeks thinking time, Crystal decided she was still happy to carry a child who was not hers biologically.  “I started doing my research and discovered, in general, NHS funding is only available to couples and not to single women, so that ruled me out,” she said. “So, feeling brave, I decided to go at it alone.

Although diminutive in stature, no one stood taller in the underworld than the ruthless Sinaloa cartel boss. Over the course of his leadership, the streets of north-west Mexico and far beyond run red with the blood of anyone who dared stand in his way as he built his poundbillion empire.  So focused on bettering his one-time idol Pablo Escobar, Guzmaacuten became so successful he was once ranked the th most powerful on the planet. However, prosecutors hope to finally bring the curtain down on the Mexicans five decades of terror as he stands trial accused of leading a continuing criminal enterprise responsible for importing and distributing massive amounts of narcotics and conspiring to murder rivals who posed a threat. The US Government said they plan to tell El Chapo’s story - part history, part biographical - during the -year-old’s four-month trial in Brooklyn’s Federal courthouse in New York.  Prosecutors hope to put El Chapo - slang for shorty in Spanish - away for le, promising that unlike when he was held in Mexico this time there will be no escape. Along with an inside look at Guzmans evolution into a criminal legend, and details of the Sinaloa cartel he allegedly controlled, the government has promised to link him personally to Scarface-like violence with a video of him interrogating a bound victim, and chilling first-ever informant testimony about his feuds with rival gangs like Los Zetas.“Around , the defendant’s workers brought two suspected Zetas members to the defendant,” prosecutors have described already in court papers. “After having lunch, the defendant interrogated them, had them beaten and then shot them both in the head with a long gun. The defendant then ordered his workers to dig a hole in the ground, throw the bodies in the hole and light the bodies on fire.”  To support their case, prosecutors have lined up a stellar cast of witnesses including numerous rivals, allies and once loyal lieutenants, along with cartel experts and law enforcement officers in the hope a jury will find in their favour.The  jurors, whose identities and lives are now protected by heavily armed police, will learn how Guzmaacuten rose from a poor teenage to the world’s biggest drugs baron.No stone, they say, will be left unturned. They will tell how Guzman began selling marijuana in elementary school and by age  was the familys primary breadwinner before then earning billions from his criminal enterprise. El Chapo entered the world of organised crime and began working for the drug lord Heacutector El GuumleroPalma in the late ‘s, overseeing the movement of drugs from Sinaloa towards the US border. Ruthlessly ambitious, he soon earned a reputation for violence, instantly shooting dead any smugglerthey were late with a drug delivery. By the early ‘s, he was working for Feacutelix “El Padrino Gallardo, the leading drug baron in Mexico at the time and head of the Guadalajara Cartel. Guzmaacuten was put in charge of logistics, tasked with coordinating drug shipments across four continents in an ever-changing fleet of trucks, planes, fishing boats and submarines. When Gallardo was arrested in  for the murder of a DEA agent, Guzmaacuten and a few others took over forming the Sinaloa Cartel. Quickly they began producing and distributing methamphetamine, heroin, ecstasy and marijuana.  It wasn’t long before El Chapo had operations in more than  countries including the UK.The authorities finally caught up to Guzmaacuten in Guatemala in June .He was extradited to Mexico and sentenced to  years in a maximum-security prison on drug and murder charges. Although behind bars, the powerful influence of El Chapo didn’t abate as he bribed guards to maintain his opulent lestyle, have conjugal visits including prostitute being brought in and even arrange business meetings allowing him to continue operating his ever-growing drug empire. In , after a ruling by the Supreme Court of Mexico made extradition between Mexico and the States easier, Guzmaacuten made an audacious escape.  After paying more than  guards, he was wheeled out of prison hidden inside a laundry basket. The escape allegedly cost the drug lord over pound million in bribes. To many Mexicans, El Chapo is as a Robin Hood-like figure, aided by stories of him strolling freely around knowing no one would dare give him up. In one reported incident, El Chapos men were said to have entered a restaurant before him telling diners: Gentlemen, please. Give me a moment of your time. A man is going to come in, the boss. We ask that you remain in your seats the doors will close, and nobody is allowed to leave. You will also not be allowed to use your cellulars. Do not worryyou do everything that is asked of you, nothing will happen. Continue eating and dont ask for your check. The boss will pay.  He was so hellbent on maintaining his foothold in the illustrative American market he ordered his we to travel to the States to give birth so that he would have anchor babies and a new secure foothold in the country. Authorities tried to stop her from crossing the border to give birth but as they had no formal charges that they could file. She succeeded in giving birth inside the US but left the fathers name blank on the birth certicate. It wasn’t long however before Guzman was back behind bars only this time as a billionaire. His luck ran out in February  after he was captured in a hotel in a beachfront area of Mazatlaacuten, Sinaloa. Mexico refused Americas requests for Guzmaacuten to be extradited to the States, demanding he face charges in Mexico.  Then Mexican President Enrique Pentildea Nieto expressed words that would later come back to haunt him stating that another escape, “would be more than regrettable it would be unforgivable for the government to not take the precautions to ensure that what happened last time would not be repeated.” On July  , El Chapo cemented his reputation as the Houdini of criminals, as he slipped down a shaft under the shower area in his prison cell and escaped through a mile long ventilated tunnel, said to have taken over a year to construct. This time Guzmaacuten’s freedom was short-lived, with authorities catching up with him six months later in the coastal city of Los Mochis, Sinaloa. This time no chances were taken, and he was quickly extradited to the States. Now after almost two years in solitary confinement in New York, El Chapo’s pound million legal dream team will today tomorrow hope to start securing his release. They include top Manhattan lawyer Jeffery Lichtman along with two criminal defence attorneys who once represented El Chapo’s nemesis, Alfredo Beltran Leyva.  Lichtman, , famously defended John “Junior” Gotti, son of the late Gambino family godfather. John Gotti, on charges he ordered the failed hit on radio host Curtis Sliwa in . Each of Juniors three trials ended with deadlocked juries. Lichtman will be joined by Eduardo Balarezo and William Purpura, who jointly defended Leyva, a kingpin known as “The Desert Ant,” on drug trafficking charges. Public documents have provided some clues as to who might take the stand.The potential witnesses include top El Chapo lieutenant, Vicente Zambada, a son of Guzmaacuten’s longtime deputy Pedro and Margarito Flores, brothers from Chicago who have previously testied that they served as his American distributors and Damaso Lopez Nuntildeez, the warden from the Puente Grande prison who helped him escape.In the last few weeks alone, prosecutors have handed the defence , new pages of documents mostly in Spanish. The papers are said to offer details on some of the  murders that Guzmaacuten is accused of committing. In all of their collective experience, defence counsel have never seen anything like this,” Guzmans lawyers said. More than once, they have called the prosecution “a trial by ambush.”For jury selection, Guzmaacuten has scarcely said a word at pretrial hearings.His typical demeanour in the courtroom is an empty gaze coupled with almost silence completely at odds with his vicious reputation.Last week he allowed his ruthless mask to slip briefly as he pleaded with a judge to let him cuddle his former beauty queen we before the case opens.I respectfully write to request that Mr Guzman be allowed to give his we, Emma Coronel Aispuro, a brief momentary greeting to include perhaps an embrace, attorney Mariel Colon Miro wrote in a letter to Judge Brian Cogan.She insisted it would not be a security risk, and said it would be a humanitarian gesture because Guzman, whos being held in solitary confinement, has not been permitted to have any contact with his we either by telephone or in person since he arrived in New York in January of last year.Coronel Aispuro, , has been pictured living the high le while her husband of  years sits in a jail cell. The couple got married when she was .El Chapos lawyers say, apart from meetings with his legal team, hes had no contact with the outside world and, as a result, his mental health has deteriorated.Judge Cogan, however, denied the plea writing that while he was “sympathetic,” a hug, however brief, would put the court’s security at risk at the very moment when Guzmaacuten’s motivation to escape” was particularly strong.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man wont stop complaining seat","story":"NewsMan wont stop complaining about his seat on plane - so flight attendant does something hilariousOne flight attendant got so fed up of a passenger complaining about their seat she did something rather sassy and people think its brilliantShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  NOV NewsA flight attendants sassy response to a passenger has gone viral\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFlight attendants have to deal with quite a lot of unusual and awkward situations in their job.

Ayna Dzabrailova, a -year-old student, packed her dowry into designer bags and suitcases - including Louis Vuitton, Etro and Versace - that cost almost pound, alone, reports say. Some  guests attended the lavish Chechen wedding in Moscow as the niece of controversial tycoon Umar Dzabrailov tied the knot with an oil manager. Dzabrailova is said to have worn Graff jewellery and two wedding outfits costing pound,, including one that was made by Lebanese fashion designer Zuhair Murad.  Originally, it had a semi-transparent skirt but the bride asked to change the lining. On day two of the festivities she wore a dress from another Lebanese designer Elie Saab. The cost of the vast dowry itself is unknown. Apart from elite cosmetics, it was unclear what gts she took from her family to new husband Haidar Sheripov, , a Chechen oil manager based in Moscow.  Ayna - also known as Alyona - wore jewellery from Britain’s Graff along with a tiara from Dubai. The wedding was held in line with Chechen traditions so there was no alcohol and the bride spent entire celebration standing, surrounded by her friends and sisters, according to reports in Moscow. Ahead of the ceremony, she and her mother had been on shopping trips to Milan, Paris and Dubai.  The bride left her home in the afternoon when friends and family of the groom arrived to an elite village in Moscow region in  limousines. The main party was held at upscale Safisa restaurant. Despite the scale of the wedding, the bride kept her eyes downcast and wore a serious expression according to tradition which holds she must appear shy and modest.  Nor was she seen with the groom but is escorted by his brother. Ayna’s uncle Umar Dzhabrailov, , a controversial tycoon and ex-Moscow senator, was fined pound, last year after he shot a Yarygin pistol in the air at the Four Seasons Hotel, close to the Kremlin. Umar admitted to being quizzed “a hundred times” by Russian secret services over the  shooting of his American business partner, Paul Tatum, in a Moscow subway.  The contract killing was one off the most controversial murders of the wild s in Moscow, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. He always denied having anything to do with the killing. Dzhabrailov and Tatum jointly ran the Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel in Moscow. In the wake of the shooting, he was banned from travelling to the US. Umar was reputed to be the role model for a Chechen godfather in Frederick Forsyths novel, Icon.

The teenager, aged just , was married after a bidding war which started when her family posted pictures online. Five wealthy men, reportedly including high-ranking government officials, were among those who bid for her hand in marriage. The shocking auction happened in South Sudan, and the wedding happened on August  after the teens father accepted  cows, three cars and ,, charity Plan International said. George Otim, Country Director of Plan International South Sudan, said: “This barbaric use of technology is reminiscent of latter-day slave markets.  That a girl could be sold for marriage on the world’s biggest social networking site in this day and age is beyond belief. “While it is common for dowries to be used in marriages in South Sudanese culture, nothing can excuse the way this girl – who is still a child – has been treated as nothing more than an object, sold off to the bidder prepared to offer the most money and goods. And Monica Adhiue, acting executive director for South Sudans National Alliance for Women Lawyers, said: The practice is a gross human rights violation and violates the rights of a girl. A photo, apparently from a Facebook post about the auction, shows a tall, expressionless girl standing next to a shorter, smiling man. Under a smiley face emoji, the post reads, Competition is perfectly allowed in Dinka Jieng culture. In a reference to the teenagers height, it says: The kids of the winner are guaranteed for NBA slots.  Taban Abel, information minister in Eastern Lakes in the centre of the war-torn nation, said the girl had since gone into hiding in the capital, Juba, but did not offer any more details. Pictures of the girl in a white wedding gown were shared on ious social media sites. Some reports referred to her as a virgin bride or the most expensive woman in South Sudan. Facebook told the Thomson Reuters Foundation it removed the post and the user from its  for violating its community standards last Friday, when it was made aware of the material. Any form of human trafficking whether posts, pages, ads or groups that co-ordinate this activity are not allowed on Facebook, a spokesman said.

The seven-year-old was seriously injured after touching the metal buffet food warmer, according to local media. It happened in Ukrainian capital Kiev, where Aisha Sulimans cash-strapped mum is appealing for help. Eyewitness Stefan Tsetsyniovskyi, , told local media: I was standing behind her in the canteen when she suddenly started to scream. We shouted at her to let go of the buffet table, but I do not think that she was able to. It lasted about  seconds, and then she fell on the floor motionless.  Teachers called Aishas mother Marina Suliman who came to the school and found her daughter lying on a table in the canteen while paramedics tried to resuscitate her. The mother said: I saw my daughter lying motionless with her eyes opened wide. They were also bleeding. Reports said that Aisha was clinically dead for  minutes before paramedics managed to start her heart. After that she was rushed to hospital and placed in the intensive care unit.  Aisha was in a coma for the first three days then she started to come round. After one month, Aisha was discharged from hospital in a vegetative state. Five months have passed since then, but her condition has not improved, according to reports. Forensic expert Elena Fedorova, who examined Aisha after the incident, said: The marks on the girls right palm and fingers indicate that they had been electrocuted. According to local media, the school head quit her post the day after the incident.  Repair work was reportedly carried out in the canteen the following week. Local authorities carried out a check two months later and did not find any violations. Marina Suliman said: Eyewitnesses and forensic experts say Aisha was electrocuted, but the school administration is trying to cover up their negligence. I brought my healthy daughter to them and they gave her back clinically dead.  The police are investigating the incident as a criminal case. Nobody has been arrested or charged yet.

Childhood sweethearts Robert McCoy, , and Victoria Gibson, , met at a local skatepark in  after school and fell head over heels in love with one another. But when Robert met -year-old Destiny Grfin at work, he wanted to bring her into the relationship - and have now been in a closed triad since August. All three say they view love as an emotion that shouldnt be limited to a couple.They also claim the best thing about being in a romantic relationship with each other is that there is twice as much love as there is in a traditional monogamous pairing. Now the triad are focused on growing stronger together and one day plan to get married and start a family.  Robert said: Morally speaking, society has embedded monogamy into the depths of iniduals and shuns those who say they love more than one person. I believe love and all other emotions have no boundaries or limits, so why not love as much as you can love. We have not always been a triad. Me and Victoria were together for a little over five years before we got with Destiny. Me and Victoria met at the skatepark while we were in high school. Me and destiny met through work. We fell in love as a triad after many, many long nights of talking and getting to know each other.Destiny is very, very open minded, but at the same time had plenty of questions on the true working of potentially being in a triad and perusing a relationship.  Robert went on to explain how he wanted to break free from the social norm. He said: This is not how I imagined le, yet now that it is here, I cant imagine anything dferent. The thought of a closed poly triad family unit is beautul to me.I enjoy the idea of family and lots of it, but I feel abandoned by one half so making a new open-minded family is everything to me. I do want to become a family person, but with those who also share that same want with me.A ing unit will have much parental, monetary, and emotional support, given we all keep good open communication and grow together as a triad. Destiny continued: Since being in a triad, Ive been able to open my mind to see that theres more to le and love than what people really think.The connection goes so much deeper and having two people by my side each day just deepens the connection we have. Thinking back to a year ago, I wouldve never thought of myself being in a triad because it sounded foreign and its looked down upon to want to be with two people at once.People ask me how it is being with two people, I tell them that I receive double of everything while being able to give double of everything love, affection, support.  Being in a triad can be complicated at times but it never takes away from the good times that we have. I love my two and the le that we have built together so far. Robert, Victoria and Destinys families are all accepting of their non-conventional relationship.Victoria explained how her family took the news and spoke about how the triad navigate any natural feelings of jealousy that may arise. My family is okay with pretty much everything I do as long as Im happy and okay, she said. I do get jealous, but I realise that its small natural jealousy and I never let it become an issue. Im really working on being able to discuss my feelings of jealousy when they come up so we can work through them together. In the future I plan on having a beautul family with my partners and having a house big enough to fit us all comfortably. Robert added: I dont get jealous. To me it was a beautul thing watching the person I love fall in love.  And at this point its even more beautul watching the two girls I love work together and provide for each other in ways I never could. Something about the way a woman cares and nurtures can never be recreated, especially by me. Destiny, , spoke about how she deals with feelings of jealousy within their unit. She said: Jealousy is a natural feeling that a human will always feel sometime in their le. In a triad, its very important to recognise, acknowledge, and talk about where each other are when it comes to jealousy. It will happen and its important to let that person know that they are still loved and is not left out.There have been times when I got jealous. I would crave someones attention while they are giving or receiving attention from or to the other, but at the end of the day, theyve never failed to attack me with love and just show that Im still important. In our relationship, theres not much jealously, except little things which can be easily talked about. The key to keeping jealousy at a minimum is to find a balance that fits everyones needs.  Robert, Victoria and Destiny share their love story on their Instagram page. Finally, Robert talked about the reaction he receives from the people he tells about his relationship and highlighted that happiness is completely inidual and personal. My reactions would mainly depend of the gender of the person I tell. Most females are rather curious, ask questions, give their views on it and we can really have a good conversation about the ideology of polyamory, he said. Guys on the other hand dont see very further than the sexual aspect of the relationship. They also dont initially see the emotion and effort that goes into being in my position but rather see it as a status symbol or ego booster. Most of the time I wont really talk about it with other guys because my emotions do run very strong for these girls and I like to express how I feel about them, not answer sexual questions or not be taken seriously as far as my relationship goes. The one message I would like to convey would have to be that an iniduals happiness lays strictly in their hands nobody knows what will make you happier than you know yourself. Regardless of whatever backlash you may receive, no matter who it is, stand strong for what makes you happy as a person.

McInnes will argue that although the Dons may not have the financial clout of some other clubs, performing well at Pittodrie can offer a route to senior caps.With four in McLeish’s squad, Aberdeen are second only to treble-winning Celtic in representation. Five Hoops players are in the squad for the ties against Albania away on Saturday and Israel at Hampden the following Tuesday.McInnes said: “Part of the message when I sign players is to highlight the rewards of signing for Aberdeen.

The message there when we sign a player is:you perform well for Aberdeen, and we are doing well as a club, then you can become an international player.”Using international recognition with Scotland as a selling point for joining the Dons has been strengthened signicantly under the management of McLeish.Former Scotland boss Gordon Strachan handed one cap to a Dons player during his near-five-year tenure: to McLean, now at Norwich City, in a - friendly defeat of Czech Republic in Prague in March .Under Strachan, who was axed after a failed World Cup  qualying campaign, Reynolds, Pawlettand Jackwere in squads but never capped.Replacement McLeish handed debut caps to McKenna and Shinnie.

Having been out of the Scotland set-up for five years, McLeish gave Mackay-Steven his second cap in the - friendly loss to Portugal last month.Devlin received a first call-up to the squad for the double header against Portugal and the - Nations League away defeat to Israel. The centre-back has yet to be capped at senior level.McInnes said: “It shows what can be doneyou’re playing well here as you are in the eye of the international manager.“At the moment it’s about getting those representatives into the senior squad, which is something at times we’ve been frustrated with in the past, but it’s great to see that recognition.”Aberdeen also have three players with the Scotland U squad for a friendly with Turkey in Murcia on Saturday: Lewis Ferguson, Bruce Anderson and Connor McLennan."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen bypass talks continue","story":"The Scottish Transport Minister is engaged in “frequent regular dialogue” with contractors over the Aberdeen bypass.Talks were held last week between Michael Matheson and contractor Aberdeen Roads Limited in a bid to iron out legal wrangles that are preventing the already-completed Craibstone, Stonehaven and Charleston sections from opening.A further discussion between the parties is due to take place this week to try to get this section of road open, which has been completed for a number of weeks but held up by a contract issue.Contractors have said the scheme will finally be finished in December – later than the previous “late autumn” deadline, which was the third missed deadline on the project.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “We are engaged in frequent regular dialogue with Aberdeen Roads Limited over the issues the cabinet secretary reported to parliament recently.“Mr Matheson is due to follow up his meeting with an update call early this week.“The cabinet secretary has committed to updating parliament when further information on an opening date is available.”"},{"url":null,"title":"animal charity in call for north east residents to rehome dogs","story":"An animal welfare charity is calling on the public to rehome dogs currently in its care.The Scottish SPCA is celebrating its annual Staffie Awareness Week from November - and hopes to find forever homes for its dogs.North-east residents are asked to come along to the centre in Drumoak to meet the canines and learn more about them.Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre manager Graeme Innes said: “We’re always looking to do more to raise awareness of the breed, which is often mischaracterised.“Staffies are one of our most popular dogs and it’s clear to see why – they are friendly, loyal and affectionate dogs.”One of the staffies resident at the Drumoak centre is Naomi.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13548879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166431538.jpg","title":"beith juniors president says club","story":"NewsBeith Juniors president says club are ready for Scottish Cup day with Ayr UnitedThe Mighty president, John Boal, says Ayrs large travelling support will be given a warm welcome at Bellsdale Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsBeith president John Boal\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at Beith Juniors today insisted they are ready and able to host Ayr United in the Scottish Cup.

Accusations of spies lurking furtively in the shadows. And claims of sabotage as posters advertising a “summit” meeting are mysteriously ripped off walls and hoardings. No – it’s not a meeting of the Klu Klux Klan in Hickory Hollow, Arakansas in the s. And no . . . it’s not a clandestine, cover-up being leaked in the basement of Washington’s Watergate Hotel in the s. This is Troon, South Ayrshire  . . . and the cloak-and-dagger involves the proposed take-over of a community activity centre. It’s Dundonald Gymnastics Clubversus Muirhead Tennants and Residents Association . And in the middle we have SAC. Normally this would mean South Ayrshire Council . . . but in this case, it really stands for Sell All Centres. Andthere’s room for another acronym – let’s throw in the real reason behind this rammy – it’s called C.A.T . . . Community Asset Transfer. SAC wants to get Muirhead Activity Centre – and its running costs – off its books. DCG – a well organised and well funded gymnastic club – would love it as their new permanent home. They’re currently based in Dundonald Activity Centre – but having to move vaulting horses and other equipment after every session is apparently getting in the way of healthy exercise. With DACattached to Dundonald Primary School and protected from CAT, the Muirhead building is a sitting target for them. But DGC operate classes seven days a week – and a take-over would leave little or no room for other sports and clubs that currently use Muirhead. And it’s this possible exclusion of other sports and interests - by a single self-serving club - that has rightly upset MTRA. But the real villain in this localised skirmish is the Community Asset Transfer policy itself. Our local council is using it as a convenient back door to off load the expense of running village halls and community properties across the whole of South Ayrshire. Interestingly, last week’s Budget - in a nod to the centenary of  – announced extra funding to protect and preserve the many village halls built to help small communities recover from the ravages of the Great War. In stark contrast, South Ayrshire Council wants to wash their hands of them! The Muirhead decision will finally fall to a full SAC meeting. It will be interesting to seethe four elected Troon councillors look their constituents in the eye – or choose to look away in line with council policy. From where I sit, Dundonald Gymnastics Club has  plus members, a waiting list, over  internet followers and employs more coaches than Dodds of Troon. It appears everyone and their auntie wants to see the wean wearing a wee blue leotard and a medal. That’s fine. But surely not at the expense of other children with other interests and needs. If DGC want a place to themselves – let them find it and fund it themselves.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilSchoolsWorld War TroonDundonaldAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13563563.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_boyle.jpg","title":"danny boyles armistice tribute pages","story":"NewsDanny Boyles Armistice tribute Pages of the Sea to honour British Armys first black officer on Ayr beachA large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsLieutenant Walter Tull\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe first black officer in the British Army will be commemorated on Ayr beach as part of director Danny Boyle’s Armistice commission Pages of the Sea. Lieutenant Walter Tull, was Britain’s second black professional footballer who had signed up with Rangers, and trained as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Walter- along with millions of other soldiers- will be honoured on Sunday, November  in a nationwide gesture of remembrance. A large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in. And the public will be asked to join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict. The project is the latest collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the World War  centenary, and will use  beaches all around the UK as their canvasses for the mass art-work. Each of the beaches taking part in the project will commemorate a dferent WW casualty.  Walter Tull was born to Alice Elizabeth Palmer, from Kent, and Daniel Tull from Barbados, the son of a slave, on April , . After the death of his parents he and his brother Edward were placed in a children’s home in Bethnal Green. Edward was later adopted and it is believed that he went on to be Britain’s first black dentist after taking over his father’s practice on St Vincent Street in Glasgow. Walter, however, began playing football with Tottenham Hotspur in , and after touring South America with them he was offered a contract, making him the second black professional footballer in Britain. When playing for Tottenham and later Northampton Town he faced a lot of racial abuse and prejudice, yet he went on to have a successful football career. In , Northampton Town began negotiations to transfer Tull to Glasgow Rangers. However, the First World War broke out before Tull could play a game for Rangers. He enlisted as a private in the Footballers’ Battalion of the British Army, where he was quickly promoted to be a sergeant. He took part in and survived the Battle of the Somme, after which he was sent to England to recover from illness. He then went to train as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Although black officers were not allowed in the British Army at this time, he was commissioned in May , thus becoming the first black combat officer in the British Army. He died in battle in France in , during the last major German offensive. His body was never found. Walter will be remembered this Sunday as the public pay their respects to millions of fallen servicemen. • Activities on Ayr beach will happen between .am and am.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnBritish ArmyArmed forcesAdoptionWorld War Ayr United FCAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"detectives step up hunt armed","story":"NewsDetectives step up their hunt for armed thugs who attacked and attempted to rob woman in her homeShareByGary Fanning:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsPolice are now appealing for information after the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDetectives today have stepped up their hunt for two armed thugs who attacked a terried woman and tried rob her in her Ayr home.

The incident along with other concerns has sparked a proposed shake-up of taxi and private hire rules. The middle seat in the front could be ditched from fleets of larger vehicles following a public consultation. The public are going to be askedpeople should still be allowed to sit in the front of vehicles. The consultation will also questionthe number of passengers sitting up front should be reduced to one. South Ayrshire Council’s Leadership Panel heard last week how the middle passenger was seated too close to drivers. A report presented to councillors said the close proximity left drivers open to accusations of “inappropriate conduct. Explaining one incident reported to the council,licensing team leader Morag Douglas said: “There were concerns that a driver was threatened by young girls who booked a private hire. “They left without paying and stated thatthe driver took any action the driver would be reported to the police for inappropriate conduct.” She said the council received other gripes from drivers about what a tight squeeze it is with two passengers in the front. Ms Douglas told how drivers said having “two larger people in the front seats” meant it is dficult to control the car without touching middle seat passengers. All eight seater vehicles licensed by the council have two passenger seats in the front and six in the back. Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “It is as much about protecting the drivers as the passengers.” He added: “We need to be cautious and make sure that whatever we come up with doesn’t have unintended consequences.” Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils don’t permit passengers in the front seats of taxis. Feedback from South Ayrshire Taxi and Private Hire Operators’ Forum members suggested the inidual drivers should decidethey want passengers up front. The members also told the council there should still be an option to have two passengers seated in the front. There are  licensed taxis and  private hire vehicles in South Ayrshire.

the match The simple answer to the question is never.Readers will be rubbing their eyes in disbelief, but the self destruct button was firmly pushed last Saturday and the home side weren’t alone in a gt strewn afternoon.Both teams seemed determined to outdo one another in a goal fest of biblical proportions.As both sets of coaches closed their eyes in horror, a sizable crowd was entertained as both nets rippled and bulged at regular intervals.With only four league games on it was the perfect opportunity for the winner to go top, an achievement that looked well and truly on when a double from the departing Sary Rahma put the Pupils in pole position.It wasn’t to be the ideal parting gt for the Pupil’s top scorer, a game that could have taken on the guise of a classic, was down to two s unable to defend as units and not as the score suggests the failings of respective defences.It was a crazy match from start to finish the visitors taking an early lead only to be pegged back immediately by Rahma.Neilston restored their lead minutes later, but the McFadyen sponsored Pupils ed to the other end and the game was level once more from a Grumoli strike.The Pupils got their noses in front when Robbie Dudley followed up his own header to score from close range with just  minutes on the clock.Although the game was stretched throughout, it wasn’t devoid of quality,  the home side#s finishing was clinical in the early stages.Three each and only half way through # the referee’s whistle brought the first half to a close and allowed time for everyone to draw breath.Sary Rahma put the home side ahead with  minutes to go and celebrated in some style – possibly his last goal for the home team and maybe the winner The dream finish to a successful stay eluded him, as the home side collapsed in the final quarter to surrender the initiative and points.The extraordinary game also had a thumping free kick from Martin McCallum that almost demolished the cross bar, before he rounded the keeper to narrow the deficit with five minutes left. IIn the final minutes the Pupils were denied what seemed a stonewall penalty.Who knows what the score would have beenit had been given and converted.Looking forward to a better team performance, Campbeltown Pupils travel to play Easthall in the league tomorrow.Gary Grumoli was in the thick of the action till going off injured in the closing moments. _cpupilsSary Rahma caught in a balletic move in front of the Neilston goal. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"letter campbeltowns role in the perisher","story":"Shortly before the war ended in , HMS Thames, the submarine depot ship, arrived at Campbeltown with her attendant submarines.The Thames was the base for the Periscope School which trained submarine commanding officers in the principles of attacking.The submarines were used to put theory into practice.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

authorities across the country had seen spending on maintaining their roads cut by  per cent since .Iain Gray, East Lothian MSP, said the latest report which revealed the state of the countyrsquos network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices. Money will have to be found and some services which are lsquonice to haversquo may have to see new or increased charges.

This process starts again now and the Conservative Group will play the fullest role it can in determining a responsible approach to our vital infrastructure.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said: ldquoMore investment is required in roads to ensure that we keep up the momentum.ldquoIt is concerning that the current level of investment is not enough to prevent conditions deteriorating further.

With  holiday lodges crammed on to the former fairways, the beautul landscape and its wildle will be lost forever. There is another way! A country park, managed by a charitable trust, could deliver fantastic community benefits, education and natural play spaces, as well as jobs and spend in the local community, enhancing rather than damaging the environment.The spokesman said it was ldquohugely questionable that  new self-catered lodges were needed, adding: ldquoAny search on [property rental website] Airbnb will show an average of  self-catering options available in North Berwick pretty much every week between September and May, so an additional  could actually overload and damage the existing tourism market.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

I noticed it one day when I went to collect my son. This would have been around .I mentioned it to a friend. She and I were in the same womens group and a friend of hers had died from breast cancer. The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds. Isnt that lovely Another special tree was one I saw at a holiday place we rented at Achnacloich, near Oban.The gardens there have this amazing redwood that looks like a gigantic hand.The reason it looks like a hand was that when it was planted a rabbit kept nibbling the bud in the middle. Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees. All the species are beautul. There is such a range of colourful berries and they are a hardy plant. In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

To find a location, he followed instructions said to have come to him in a dream and loaded panniers of gold on the back of a donkey.William followed the animal as it roamed across his lands. When night fell, it rested under a tree on a higher and rockier site close to the steep-sided Allt Dearg.The castle was built on that spot with the unique quirk that it was constructed around the tree. This subsequently became a feature of part of the cellar, known since as ldquoThe Hawthorn Room.Legend has it that the tree has magical qualities which have on more than one occasion saved the castle from disaster.Modern scientic analysis has revealed that the tree died in approximately , most likely as a result of being deprived of light because the castle had been built around it.

Professor Norman Drummond, the former army chaplain who chaired the Scottish First World War commemorations , made it clear in his address that the service, attended by over , people including Princess Anne and the First Minister, was not just about then, but now as well. The memory of the Great War, he said, was a tool for the living and a warning not to let politics get out of hand. No one referred to anything ndash or anyone ndash specic, but the congregation will have had their own ideas about what he could mean.The service had started in the light at pm and ended in the dark an hour later in a day full of symbols. At am, pipers played laments all over the country, at .am cathedral bells began to ring out and at am, thousands of Scots made the traditional gesture of silence, which this year was given added poignancy because it marked what came to be called the Great Silence: the days and weeks after the guns stopped on November , .The service at Glasgow Cathedral was the focal point of the day and, in words and music, concentrated on four themes: first, sadness at the loss of lealso, the sense of victory against the odds and the seeds of social change ndash the congregation was reminded that the Glasgow rent strikes happened just a short walk from the cathedral.The fourth theme was one that perhaps some might feel less certain about in uncertain times: courage for the future. In his prayer, Professor Drummond quoted the Canadian medical officer Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae: ldquoTo you from failing hands we throw the torch be yours to hold it high. That torch of hope and love, said Professor Drummond, continues to be thrown to each and every one of us, in our homes and in our families, in our communities and across the nation. But the torch is not as bright in some places as others, the places where war is still happening,  years later.One of the next generation taking the torch symbolically at the cathedral was ten-year-old Cara Lucas from Peebles who read the prayer of St Francis of Assisi. ldquoLord make me an instrument of your peace she said, but the words were especially poignant because Cararsquos family knows peace is far from being sorted yet: Cararsquos father Alexander James Lucas was a Royal Marine Commando when he was killed in action in Afghanistan on November , . He was  years old.Cararsquos reading was among the many words of peace and hope in the service, but there were also reminders of the greatest tragedies. Such as the fact the signing of the armistice did not immediately mean the end of the killing. It was signed very early in the morning but a few hours later, at .am, trooper George Ellison of the th Royal Lancers died near Mons. He is the last known British soldier to be killed. Scottish battalions also continued to be involved in operations until  and in southern Russian until .The music at the service reflected the desire, or duty, to remember these stories ndash at one point the Glasgow Cathedral Choir, their voices beautully filling the nave, repeated one refrain ldquowe will remember them. And the service reflected how valuable music was to the men in the trenches by including Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag. The bit in the song about lighting your fag may not have quite the resonance it once had, but it was one of the most moving moments of the service when the congregation sang the song in  just as men would have done in the trenches in .The music also focused on particular stories ndash like John Lauder, the son of the great Scottish entertainer Sir Harry Lauder. Soloist Amy Hawthorn and the congregation sang perhaps Lauderrsquos most famous song Keep Right on the End of the Road. The words are still inspiring, especially when sung by a thousand people: ldquo yoursquore tired and weary still, journey on til you come to your happy abode. But the congregation was reminded why Sir Harry wrote it: his son was killed in action in December . Sir Harry decided the show had to go on and ed to the stage just a few days later.The congregation at Glasgow also included the descendants of some of those who died in the war, including the family of four Glasgow brothers, including William Herbert Anderson who was awarded the Victoria Cross. Lieutenant Colonel William Herbert Anderson, known as Bertie, was commanding the th Battalion, The Highland Light Infantry, as it moved through France in March . He was awarded the VC for leading his command in a double-counter attack, successfully driving the enemy away despite being overwhelmingly outnumbered. However, his bravery cost him his le and he died behind enemy lines on  March  at the age of .Bertie was the last of four brothers to perish in the war ndash Charlie had died on  December  at the age of , followed by Ronnie on  October  at the age of . Both had also served in the Highland Light Infantry. A week before Bertiersquos death, his youngest brother Teddie, who had transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, went down in a plane over Winchester on  March  aged just .Bertiersquos great-grandson, Robin Scott-Elliot, who attended the commemoration with his we Karen and their daughters Iona and Torrin, said he had always found it hard to imagine what his ancestors suffered.ldquoItrsquos unthinkable what the parents of Bertie, Charlie, Ronnie and Teddie must have gone through, losing all four sons in less than four years, he said. ldquoWhen I think about when they died in relation to my age now, Irsquom struck by how truly short their lives were.ldquoThe impact of their deaths was felt in the family for years ndash their parents never recovered, and my grandfather, who was a toddler at the time of Bertiersquos death, had to go through le without a father - an experience which was shared by many after the war.ldquoI am very proud of the brave actions of my great-grandfather and great-uncles. Itrsquos so important to pass these stories on to the next generation so that the devastation caused by the war is never forgotten.Iona Scott-Elliot, aged , great-great granddaughter of Bertie, added: ldquoI think we should always try to remember my great-great grandad and all the other men and women like him even though they died a long time ago.It would be hard to put it better than Iona did, but the Glasgow service did succeed in pointing out that the centenary commemorations have to be about more than remembering.The service reminded the congregation, and the audience watching on BBC, that amongst the troops at the front line there was relief at having survived but there was also anger and resentment too about what they had been put through.Some good came from that anger and restlessness ndash the vote was extended to all men over and to women over . But the service reminded us too that the lessons of the Great War were not immediately learned ndash there was a determination to be as hard as possible on the Germans in the peace negotiations after the war - and so - as we know - the seeds of the Second World War were sewn.This concern about how we learn the lessons of war and peace was reflected in one of the most powerful readings by Gurjit Singh Lali, a member of the Scottish commemorations . He quoted Gandhi: ldquoI am a man of peace, I believe in peace but I do not want peace at any price. I do not want the peace that you find in the grave. There were also words from King George V speaking in Flanders in . ldquoCan there be more potent advocates of peace upon the earth, he asked, ldquo than this massed multitude of silent witness to the desolation of war Norman Drummond explored similar themes in his address. Four years ago, when the commemorations began and a service was held in Glasgow Cathedral in , Professor Drummond asked an important question: what have we learned from all this  There were some who were critical of the idea of four years of remembrance and still are. Others asked whether it was right for then PM David Cameron to spend poundmillion on the commemorations. Part of the justication was that we should learn from the past and teach future generations, but four years on, Professor Drummond, and everyone , is still trying to find an answer to his question: what have we learned from all this In his address to the congregation, Professor Drummond said personal connections to war were important and had become more important over the last four years ndash cupboards were opened, boxes found, and letters from a century ago read and re-read. But Professor Drummond said he had learned that certain values are timeless ndash loyalty, devotion, courage, resilience. The lesson was to be there for each other ndash to be the stretcher bearer, in war and peace, for those in any kind of need.The final words of the service and the final powerful symbol went to the Right Revd Susan Brown, the moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Mrs Brown admits herself that she is not a big woman, but her voice was big in a cathedral that was bigger. Remember the poppy, she said. The black at its centre is the blackness of war. The red of its leaves is the red of blood. But most important of all is the green of its stem, she said, because that is the green shoot of hope.And the last bit of music in a service of music  That went to Andy Cant, who started the service with his violin high up in the roof of the cathedral. For the closing moments, he switched to the pipes and ended Scotlandrsquos act of remembrance with a wordless gesture that was perhaps its most moving. A lone piper sounding out clearly, powerfully and hopefully.The service at the cathedral was the centrepiece of a poignant day of remembrance that started before the sun came up. The first act of commemoration was at am when pipers across the country, standing in the dark, played Battlersquos Orsquoer, the traditional lament that is often heard at the end of war.Many of the pipers played at their local war memorial, but the lament was also heard at the Forth Bridge, and Cpl McClintock of Sqn ATC had the honour of piping Battles Orsquoer at the tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey. The lament was also heard at Ibrox Stadium.Just a few hours later, at .am, the bells of Dunblane Cathedral were rung to mark the moment  years ago when the bells were rung at the end of the war. Across the day, church bells were also rung in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling ndash some by new bell-ringers recruited over the last year to commemorate the , British bellringers who died between  and .There were other, new ways to remember too, starting at Ayr beach in the morning. Slowly, as a group of volunteers worked away on the sand yesterday, a face emerged, only to be washed away later by the tide. The face on Ayr beach was of Walter Tull, the first black officer in the British Army and one of British footballrsquos first black players. Tull had signed for Rangers when he was  but was killed while engaged in combat near Arras in Northern France. Yesterday, the sea slowly erased the sand-painting of his face as a reminder of his sad loss.Similar events were staged at other beaches across the UK, including West Sands at St Andrews, where they commemorated Elsie Inglis, a pioneering surgeon and suffragist. Other beaches taking part in the project in Scotland were Scapa beach, Orkney, St Ninianrsquos beach, Shetland, Roseisle beach, Moray, and Culla Bay on Benbecula.The beach events were the idea of the filmmaker Danny Boyle, who said they seemed the perfect place to reflect some of the consequences of the Great War. ldquoBeaches are truly public spaces, where nobody rules other than the tide, he said. ldquoThey seem the perfect place to gather and say a final goodbye and thank you to those whose lives were taken or forever changed by the First World War.The beach remembrance events happened throughout the day but it was at am that most of the country took part. The Armistice was signed in  in Compiegne and came into force on the th hour of the th day of the th month and at the same time  years later politicians, civic leaders, veterans and relatives gathered to mark the centenary at the symbolic centres of remembrance across the country.At the Cenotaph in London, the Prince of Wales led the Royal Familyrsquos tributes as the Queen looked on from a balcony. Charles laid a wreath on behalf of his mother for the second year in a row, while an equerry laid a wreath on behalf of the Duke of Edinburgh.In a signicant and hopeful break with history, the President of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was also present and laid a wreath on behalf of the German people. It is the first time since the Cenotaph was inaugurated in  that a representative of the country has taken part in the UKrsquos national service of remembrance.At am precisely, the traditional two minutes of silence was held, but there was also a signicant and welcome sound: the chimes of Big Ben. The clock is being renovated and has been silent since August  when works began, but it has been fitted with a custom-built electronic mechanism built to power the striking hammer to ensure it can still sound for important national events.In Scotland, the am silence was observed at the Cenotaph in Glasgowrsquos George Square, while in Edinburgh First Minister Nicola Sturgeon laid a wreath at the Stone of Remembrance outside the City Chambers.Following the service, the city then thanked those who served with a procession from St Gilesrsquo Cathedral to the steps of the Scottish National War Memorial at Edinburgh Castle. The memorial houses and displays the rolls of honour of Scots servicemen and women from all the armed services, the Dominions, Merchant Navy, Womenrsquos Services, Nursing Services and civilian casualties of all wars.By the time darkness fell after pm, the remembrance took on a new shape at the Scottish Parliament when the names of the , men and women from the rolls of honour were projected on to the building. Along with Scottish servicemen, the names included nurses, munitions factory workers, Merchant Navy personnel, and overseas servicemen.The scale of the loss was reflected by the fact it took seven hours to show all the names, finishing around midnight. Each name shone on the building for around  seconds to the sound of Sir John Blackwood McEwenrsquos String Quartets Volume  by the Chilingrian Quartet. There were also images and designs that tell the story of the global war.The presiding officer Ken Macintosh said it was a striking tribute. ldquoThe fact it will take seven hours to project the names of all those who died reflects the sheer scale of the loss and devastation the warhad on communities right across Scotland, he said.The parliamentrsquos tribute was not the only light of hope and peace that shone into the dark evening. Shortly before pm, Shetlander Geoffrey Priest made his way to Saxa Vord, in the north of Unst, where he lit a beacon that was the centrepiece of the islandrsquos commemoration of the centenary. It is no surprise that Shetland would want to mark the sombre occasion, as  Shetland men lost their lives in the First World War ndash a higher proportion than anywhere  in Britain.Finally, the day and night of commemoration came to an end at .pm when an audience of around  filled the Usher Hall in Edinburgh for a performance of the multimedia production Far, Far from Ypres, which brings the story of prototypical Scots soldier Jimmy McDonald to le through songs, poems and real stories.The show featured large screen projection of images from the war and a cast of folk singers who remained on stage throughout the performance, singing the lsquotrenchrsquo, lsquomarchingrsquo and Music Hall songs of the time.Jimmyrsquos story brought the day of remembrance to an end and there was then a chance for Professor Norman Drummond to reflect on what has been learned over the last four years.Professor Drummond told The Herald that he wanted the last four years of commemoration to reflect a theme of reconciliation but also education.ldquoWhen I was invited by the Scottish Government to chair and set up the Scottish Commemorations Panel, I accepted on three conditions ndash that it would concentrate on education, genealogy and legacy and we asked: what do we learn from all this  he said. \"I think the Scottish commemorations have been pivotal in reminding us that this is not just remembrance ndash important though that is ndash but itrsquos about what we take forward to the future.ldquoWe live in ided times and I think the First World War gives us evidence of what happens when we let politics get out of hand.Professor Drummond and his family have also felt the last four years personally. His grandfather Norman Walker, who served on the Western Front, where he was badly gassed, was awarded the MC in . Later, he was an international cricketer and played for Scotland ndash all on one lung.ldquoI was about seven or eight when he died, said Professor Drummond, ldquobut I can identy with those who wish they could talk to those who are no longer with us, to ask them: what was it really like Professor Drummondrsquos we Elizabeth also has personal connections to the conflict through her grandfather John Burn, of the Tyneside Scottish, serving with the Northumberland Fusiliers. He was killed on the th September  and, earlier this year, Professor Drummond and his we went out to Johnrsquos grave in France.ldquoThere we were, he said, ldquo years on, around one grave almost to the hour of when he would have been killed.Professor Drummond said he wanted the day to reflect four themes ndash the first being a collective sadness at the loss of le. Historians still argue about the precise number of Scots who lost their lives but we can safely say that over , died.And it was particularly poignant on the centenary of the end of the war to note that many soldiers died on the last day itself, including  Scots.The second theme was victory and Professor Drummond acknowledged that it was not just about joy but profound mixed emotions.He also hopes that the commemorations over the last four years have struck the right tone. He said: ldquoWersquove always tried to have the appropriate tone and the advice wersquove received is that, yes, the victory was important at that time ndash therefore, we commemorate it from a long lens. But there was joy and relief that it was all over and that we had withstood overwhelming odds and were really proud of the way our men and women responded.The third theme was seeds of change ndash an effort to reflect the fact that the First World War led, in the short and longer term, to economic, social, cultural and political changes."},{"url":null,"title":"wind-turbines-generating-98-of-scotlands-electricity-demand","story":"WWF Scotland said that National Grid demand for the month was ,, MWh and that almost all of this could have been provided by wind turbines, which provided record levels of power.Turbines generated the equivalent of % of all Scotlands electricity demand or enough to power nearly five million homes last month, the group said.Read more:End oil and gas and hit the worst emitters hard ndash how Scotland could fight climate changeThe best day was October  when turbines generated ,.

We took forward the proposition that we did on the basis of the projects and the situation that we found ourselves.\"It came as Mr Mundell announced a poundminvestment in Dundees world-leading games industry.Devastated workers at Michelinrsquos Baldovie complex were told they faced losing their jobs last week.It was a devastating blow to a city which recently celebrated the opening of the pound million VA design museum.Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to leave ldquono stone unturned as ministers scramble to save the site.Michelin, which is the largest industrial employer in Dundee, blamed a struggling market and cheap imports for its decision.Dundee City Council leader John Alexander said he was under ldquono illusions about the struggle ahead.He said: ldquoThe reality is, the ripple effect this has is quite signicant. And at a time when we are trying to revitalise, re-energise the local and regional economy, this clearly sends the wrong message.ldquoWe are absolutely laser focused on getting a positive outcome for as many of those workers as we possibly can, and retaining a footprint for Michelin, whatever that may look like."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9030795.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sponsored-content-discover-six-delicious-ways-to-enjoy-fresh-scottish-seafood","story":"The Crinan HotelThe Crinan Hotel has been famous for the freshest seafood and a fine selection of other local produce for nearly fty years.You can choose from a range of dining options -The Westward Restaurant is just the place for a relaxing evening meal with an outstanding view out over the sea towards the islands.

At best this is a distraction as the whole category represents just .% of total alcohol and has been in long-term decline for many years.\"He stressed that there was \"no such thing as problem drinks, only problem drinkers\", adding: \"Many people inside and outside the drinks industry predicted that MUP would prompt consumers to switch - both regular and moderate drinkers who dont want to be penalised and dependent drinkers who will displace misuse from one substance to another, i.e. to include prescription and illicit drugs.\"Read more: Glasgow School of Art defends its fire measuresThe same market figures, compiled by IRI, show an % year-on-year surge in lager sales in supermarkets and other off-licence outlets over the same -week period.

With the exception of some own brand spirits, there has been no change in their price and therefore no expectation that sales would decline.Alcohol Focus Scotland noted that the increases coincided with an unusually hot summer, the World Cup and the royal wedding.Colin Angus, a researcher at Sheffield Universitys Alcohol Research Group, which provided modelling to the Scottish Government in relation to MUP predicting that the policy would result in  fewer alcohol-related deaths per year, said it was more telling to compare buying patterns in Scotland and England during this period rather than a straight year-on-year comparison.He said: \"A more relevant comparison is to look at alcohol consumption over the same period in England, where MUP is not currently in place.\"Alcohol sales in England rose by substantially more over the same period, suggesting that in the absence of MUP we might have seen a bigger rise in drinking in Scotland.\"As tempting as it is to look for immediate impacts of the policy, this volatility means that the real test of MUP will be in how drinking in Scotland changes over the next few years.\"This new data doesnt mean that MUP isnt working by any means - we just can tell that yet.\"Mr Angus added that that despite Buckfasts toxic reputation in the west of Scotland - where it has long been associated with crime and antisocial behaviour - it was less commonly consumed among those struggling with alcoholism.He said: \"The increase in Buckfast sales is striking, but we cannot tellthis is as a result of dependent drinkers switching, or simply increasing popularity of Buckfast in other groups.\"Although commonly associated with problematic youth drinking in the public perception, Buckfast has not historically been drunk in large volumes by dependent drinkers.\"Buckfasts distributor, J Chandler, also said sales of the tonic wine \"have been increasing over the past tow to three years\".Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland said: ldquoWersquore seeing some evidence that people are switching drinks - that is to be expected - but until the thorough independent evaluation of MUP we wonrsquot be able to see the full effect on consumption and harm.\"The evaluation is currently underway and will provide a complete assessment of its impact on health, crime and the economy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"more-than-1000-fewer-pupils-learning-a-musical-instrument","story":"New figures show numbers accessing instrumental music tuition fell from , in   to , in   - the first recorded fall in pupil numbers.The decline comes before the impact of more recent increases to charges with eleven councils hiking rates to as much as pound a year.The Improvement Service, the support organisation for Scottish local government, also found demand for instrumental music tuition is far greater than supply following drastic cuts to music tutors.Only five out of  councils are able to offer it to all interested pupils and many councils are operating waiting lists, Some are even managing demand through \"selection tests\".Parent body Connect said a survey on the issue highlighted the trend with one family responding: \"The current system of testing for aptitude in P without warning favours young people whose parents have already invested in music lessons.\"Anecdotally, those in my sonrsquos year who have passed the test are all already receiving private music tuition.\"Last week, The Herald revealed the number of music instructors working in Scottish schools has plummeted to an all-time low with just  dedicated tutors serving primary and secondary schools compared to , in .The decline, combined with the move by some councils to increase charges, has sparked fears school music is facing ldquoextinction.The latest decline was revealed as the Scottish Parliamentrsquos education committee prepares to open an inquiry into the future of school music services.The inquiry was launched after a petition calling for free musical instrument tuition to be made a statutory right was signed by nearly , people.Campaigners estimate it would cost about pound million per year to ensure all children have a right to instrumental lessons, but say the benefits make the investment worthwhile economically and educationally.Papers for this weeks meeting of the committee highlight concerns from the Instrumental Music Teachersrsquo Network on further cuts planned by councils.The network said Edinburgh was anticipating a potential budget cut, which would mean a  per cent reduction in music staff and , fewer pupils able to access the service.

But in , Countess Haig, we of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, suggested that a factory, employing those men disabled by war, should be created to make poppies for Scotland. First based in an old wood-chopping factory in the grounds of Whitefoord House in Edinburgh, it moved in  to an old printing works in the city’s Warriston Road.And after this year’s very special Armistice centenary year, the factory will be on the move again – albeit on a temporary basis.A team of around  ex-servicemen and women who hand-assemble more than five million poppies and , wreaths every year for the Scottish Poppy Appeal will be moving to Redford Barracks for two years to allow for a much-needed refurbishment of the factory.The aim is not to rip out the heart of what is a very special workplace – boasting regimental flags and thank you letters and posters from the thousands of school children who have visited.But some £. million from the Libor Fund – fines imposed on banks for manipulation of Libor levels – will ensure the factory is fit for the st Century.Overseeing the move immediately after this year’s Remembrance Day will be factory manager Charlie Pelling, who has been at the helm since .During a tour of the factory, Charlie explained more about the move.He said: “We’ll be moving on November  with the aim of being operational by the start of January.“The aim is to be back at our factory in time for the  or  appeal.“We have a small window of opportunity to make the move as the factory operates year round.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buteman webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Band of brothers...Alastair Skene, Gerry Lindsay, Stewart Ballantyne, David Adamson, Arthur Dyke and Danny Renowden who help to make five million Scottish poppies annually. \"  \"  Armistice  Picture Gallery: Meet Scotland’s poppy makersviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buteman webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Special year...for PoppyScotland with Gordon Michie, its head of fundraising, hoping to raise an additional #, from the  Poppy Pledge campaign. \"  \"  Armistice : PoppyScotland’s  Poppy Pledge campaign viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"“We are like a toy shop in that we work  months of the year with sales throughout that period but our sales climax in the run-up to Remembrance Day in the way a toy shop does at Christmas.“We’ve got to strip out asbestos from the factory, update the heating and wiring, modernise the windows and install a lt to the first floor.“We have to make the factory health and safety compliant and fit for purpose for the st Century.”Charlie is also hopeful that they will be able to create a learning facility.He said: “Thousands of visitors tour the factory every year – from pensioners to pre-schoolers.“Around  school children visit the factory each year, with the same number of adults too.“We want to create an educational facility where they learn about the factory before touring the site.”The workers who power the factory will, however, remain at its beating heart and will be involved in the refurbishment and move.“We have records for more than  servicemen and women who have worked here,” said Charlie. “Since , we’ve had in excess of  workers.“The factory exists to provide employment for ex service personnel who may otherwise struggle to find employment.“They work year round to ensure that enough poppies are created for the Poppy Appeal and for the many wreaths laid at ceremonies across the country.“The move to Redford Barracks will undoubtedly be challenging.“But we’ve got a plan and some very good people here so we’re confident we’ll do it and still be able to create all the poppies for .“The fact we don’t have a modern production line is something we cherish.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Tuesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmAfter  years of operations, reservations for Loganair’s Orkney Inter-Isles services can now be made online.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish. The Minister should stop dragging her feet and start delivering for the industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They also campaign to improve their lives and remember the fallen.Mark Bibbey, chief executive of Poppyscotland said: “Members of the Armed Forces are often based far away from home so an initiative like this which offers a signicant discount on travel must be applauded. This will also make Loganair’s extensive network more accessible to those who have served, and to Forces families too.It underlines Loganair’s commitment to supporting the Armed Forces community and is just the latest way in which they have demonstrated this.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented. Regular eye tests are important for everyone, but especially for people living with diabetes who should also ensure they attend appointments for specialist diabetic eye screening.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Tuesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Armadale to Mallaig crossing is among the most popular ferry routes in Scotland according to new figures obtained by Kate Forbes MSP.According to  statistics, Ardrossan to Brodick had the highest number of passengers with ,, followed by Largs to Millport , Wemyss Bay to Rothesay , Oban to Craignureand Mallaig to Armadale .Skye, Lochaber and, Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes said she was surprised that Mallaig to Armadale crossing proved more popular than Ullapool to Stornoway .The statistics also showed that the Skye to Mallaig route was the most popular crossing for coaches across Scotland.Kate Forbes MSP said: “Since RET was introduced by the SNP Government, it’s great to see the rise in passengers.“RET is vitally important to the islands and has arguably done more than anything  to level the playing field for island communities who need to travel.“Mallaig to Armadale figures were up by  per cent compared to the fateful summer of . Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role.

It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8695614.1541521803!/image/image.jpg","title":"irish language group funding snub claim rejected by dup","story":"A DUP councillor has rejected claims that unionists #snubbed# a request to fund an Irish language event.Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge submitted a request to Mid and East Antrim Council to fund an event as part of Seachtain na Gaeilge , which takes place each March.Sinn Fein councillor Patrice Hardy claimed unionist councillors had “refused to even countenance” the request, adding: “Seachtain na Gaeilge is a hugely positive, global event which this council should be supporting rather than snubbing. “The Irish language community aren’t seeking special treatment, they are only seeking equality.”Last year, Ms Hardy accused the council of being “anti-Irish to the core”, after a move to have the local authority participate in Irish Language Week was rejected following a vote by members. In a statement yesterday, she added: “Despite all the controversy over the previous refusal to fund Seachtain na Gaeilge or even to engage with the Irish language community to discuss this, it appears that some members of the council have learned nothing.”But DUP Councillor Gregg McKeen said Conradh na Gaelige had been treated “the same as any other group” who had made a funding request, by pointing them towards the council’s grants programme.He told the News Letter: “They will be assessed under the same criteria as everyone .

I thought about it and she helped me get started. It was Ms Muir who got me my first customers, some young people from the catering college who were doing work experience at the hotel.“Since then I have had all sorts of people through the doors, workmen, shopfitters, young doctors and shop managers.“I have had a lot of peopleto the BB every year and I even get Christmas cards from them.”FOOTBALLERSHowever, Betty explained one of her favourite parts of the job was hosting the overseas footballers for Ballymena United.In fact it was this that rekindled Bettys love of football and she regularly attends matches at the Showgrounds.When Betty was young her brothers used to take her to the Ballymena United home matches and they won the Irish Cup.Despite running a busy BB Betty is a keen traveller and has been around the world on her own four times.She is also involved in Radio Cracker and is a community volunteer in Broughshane and her retirement will allow her to spend more time on both.Although owing to arm pains she said there would be “no more weeding just tea making” and Betty likes the tea breaks.She commented: “I have had a wonderful  years running my BB and have enjoyed meeting so many interesting people and helping them to enjoy their stay in Ballymena.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank my neighbour Margaret who would fill in for meI was ever running a bit late. I would also like to thank all my customers for their support during the last  years.“I will greatly miss meeting and dealing with so many lovely people but I am looking forward to some more leisure time now.”Meanwhile, Betty was delighted recently to receive a letter from the Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Lindsay Millar, congratulating her on her retirement.The Mayor said Bettys service to local tourism was a “fantastic achievement”.She added: “Without the continued efforts of local people like Betty, who kept tourism alive during the dark years of The Troubles, Northern Ireland would not be experiencing the resurgence in visitors that we are lucky enough to benefit from today.”The Mayor thanked Betty for the “time, effort, resources and personal commitment” she has put into welcoming visitors to the Borough.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

We had Deck the Falls back in , Turkey last year and now this feels like the completion of part of a trilogy.”“The demand for the shows is growing each year,” said Gerard, “audiences have really taken the characters Ciarán and I play and given us such great support. At the start of November we learned that there are only  per cent of the tickets left at the Mac and people are coming in every day to get their tickets early for the Roddy’s. If there were more days in December we would put on more shows as the demand is there.”“Audiences can expect pretty much what they have experienced before, especially in terms of laughter,” said Ciarán. “There are wedding bells in the air in the production, North Belfast is meeting West Belfast and the introduction of the Glider is bringing our characters East.

Countess and Winalot, the two dogs, are woofing all the way towards Christmas too. Our bride is played by me and called Mini Driver who is from the Oldpark, Feargal is our groom and the all important wedding prep forms part of the story too.”Gerard spoke of how the hard work has been going on behind the scenes since .“It’s been great how much the audiences have backed us. The real compliment is that the audiences keep growing and this year we’ve added matinees into the Mac, we want to branch out to new audiences each year and will be taking the show to Naomh Éanna on December  as well.”Ciarán said that due to overwhelming demand a handful of dates will be performed after Christmas at Fruithill Bowling Club, Gort Na Mona and St Paul’s GAC on the ,  and  of December. “We will be working on new material for  and ‘Em Two Balloons will be bringing out a new production.

This was always going to be an extremely dficult, extremely complex negotiation, but we are almost within touching distance now.“But as the PM has said, it can’t be a deal at any price. It has got to be one that works in terms of feeling we can deliver on the referendum result and that is why there is a measure of caution.”In her annual address to the Lord Mayor’s Banquet on Monday, the Prime Minister confirmed the negotiations were approaching the “end game”, but said there were still “signicant” issues standing in the way of an agreement.If there is no deal by the end of Wednesday, the prospects of a special Brexit summit in Brussels in November will recede sharply, further reducing Mrs May’s chances of getting a vote in Parliament before Christmas.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mr Lidington acknowledged it would be an “important” moment, but refused to be drawn on suggestions it will mark the point that the Government has to start putting into action its no-deal contingency plansthere was no agreement.“I am not going to put dates to particular ascribed actions,” he said.He added however: “There does come a point at which contingency plans have to be stepped up simply so that in that eventuality, the preparations have been done.“You may have to run the two things in parallel.”Mrs May faces continuing unrest among Brexiteer ministers who fear she is preparing to give too much ground to Brussels in her efforts to get an agreement.Around half a dozen ministers, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Environment Secretary Michael Gove, are prepared to tell her that leaving without a deal would be better than the proposals on the table from Brussels, according to The Daily .The group was said to have met for drinks at International Trade Secretary Liam Fox’s office on Monday night to discuss their concerns, ahead of the Cabinet meeting.In her speech at Guildhall in London, the Prime Minister said that while both sides in the talks wanted a viable withdrawal agreement, “what we are negotiating is immensely dficult”.She added: “Overwhelmingly, the British people want us to get on with delivering Brexit, and I am determined to deliver for them.“I want them to know that I will not compromise on what people voted for in the referendum. This will not be an agreement at any cost.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup to back labours vote on brexit legal advice","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We also believe there are opportunities to provide post-mortem findings more quickly and enhance the support and information families receive.“While it is acknowledged that a service outside of Northern Ireland is not what we would wish for, working closely with a much larger centre such as Alder Hey will provide a more robust service in the interim period.”SDLP health spokesman Mark H DurkanUlster Unionist councillor Julie Flaherty, who lost her two-year-old son five years ago, expressed anger at the decision.UUP MLA Doug Beattie, who lost a grandson at only  months old, also hit out at the Secretary of State Karen Bradley and told her to immediately appoint a health minister to take essential decisions.Cllr Julie Flaherty, the current Lord Mayor of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon, said: “It is a tragedy for any family to lose a baby or young child. Nothing can ever prepare you for it and even years after it, their loss remains with you for every hour of every day.“I lost my son Jake when he was only  years and  days old in . Unfortunately I know from bitter experience how hard it is for parents to face delays for a post-mortem - my husband and I were forced to wait an extra  days in order for a specialist to be found.“That delay only made a nightmare even more dficult for us so I’m furious that the experience we were forced to go through will now be imposed upon so many more parents in Northern Ireland.\"Doug Beattie said: \"The news that child post-mortems are going to be undertaken in England instead of Northern Ireland will only add to the hurt and heartache of those families that have lost a young loved one. This is truly disgraceful and the blame must be levelled at politicians who have not been in post to make strategic decisions and not at the Health and Social Care Board.\"SDLP health spokesman Mark H Durkan MLA said the changes were \"unacceptable\" and has written to the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Health seeking urgent answers.Mr Durkan said: \"The proposal that families will need to send their beloved child away for a week to get these answers will mean more stress and suffering for families in their darkest hour. It may well lead to parents opting out of the process altogether.\"I am seeking urgent clarication not only on how this completely unacceptable situation has arisen but also on what solutions have been explored.\"If this service is lost now, will it ever be restored  Is there the possibility of an all-island solution \""},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic updates latest delays and updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is crucial the real voice of this region is heard, and the concerns and interests of people and business are taken into account.https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland stephen-farry-may-made-a-mistake-framing-backstop-in-constitutional-terms-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph news uk article.ece fab AUTOCROP h --_new__I.JPGEmailYesterday I joined with the other Northern Ireland Remain parties to stand up for the interests of this region. It is crucial the real voice of this region is heard, and the concerns and interests of people and business are taken into account..pushInstead, the voices being heard, and indeed amplied, by the UK Government are leading to a distorted narrative and much riskier situation. Northern Ireland rejects hard border - and % say united Ireland more likely after Brexit  Pro-Remain parties urging EU to stay firm on Ireland border backstop There is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit. All versions will pose huge problems and indeed dangers for the economy, political cohesion and opportunities for the people of Northern Ireland.Three broad paths are available through Brexit. The first is a Peoples Vote for to reconsider the entire process.The second is for the UK as a whole to enter into a fresh customs union with the EU and to stay in the single market.And,these are ruled out, then the third is to see a special deal in which this region stays inside both of those economic mechanisms.The backstop itself is not that special deal, but rather reflects the basic steps to avoid a hard border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement. It is the necessary safety-net - an insurance policy. It only worksit is open-ended, until and unless something better is agreed.Brexit is turning into an unprecedented crisis for the UK. With barely weeks to go before the effective deadline for a withdrawal agreement, it is clear the Government still doesnt have a coherent negotiating strategy and remains caught in contradictory red lines.Any deal within the Government does not itself guarantee acceptance by the EU and the honouring of existing commitments, including around the backstop. In turn, any withdrawal agreement increasingly looks likely to struggle to get through Parliament.I believe there is a majority across the UK and certainly among MPs for either a new referendum or a soft Brexit. It would be perverse in a democratic society to see a bad deal or no deal, with the UK going over the clf edge, without these possibilities being fully tested.More immediately,a withdrawal agreement is to be concluded then all roads lead through the backstop. The only viable version is something based on the proposals from the European Commission.The Prime Minister has made a profound mistake in making a drama out of this and in particular framing it in constitutional terms, or claiming the fragmentation of the UK economy. It is not a threat to or a change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. If anything, it would bring a level of certainty in an unstable and fluid environment.Economically, there are already plenty of examples where this region does things dferently. The backstop does not inhibit trade with Great Britain, and indeed could see Northern Ireland become a bridge between Great Britain and the EU, and vice versa.Northern Ireland would do much better from remaining under the EUs trade umbrella and maintaining access to the largest market in the world, while benefiting from its trade deals. By contrast, the so-called independent trade policy is a delusion.It is not too late for the UK to see sense and to turn this around. But it is time for anyone with a stake in the future to speak out.Stephen Farry is the Alliance Party deputy leader and party spokesman on Brexit"},{"url":null,"title":"listen pilots report multiple ufo sightings in irish airspace investigation underway","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees. For a modest fee, bulk waste can be collected outside peoplersquos homes.ldquoFor the le of me I do not understand why people are prepared to load up their vehicles and drive to secluded, rural areas to get rid of household waste. Why not just drive to one of the three household centres in our district Cllr Curran said local council officials were placing increasing emphasis on promoting the district as a major tourist destination and the last thing they wanted to see was roads littered with waste.He added: ldquoThe message must go out that illegal dumping is unacceptable and that the countryside and indeed town centres must be respected, not used as open air dumps by people who should know better.ldquoWe are fortunate to live in a stunningly beautul area which should not be blighted by the reprehensible actions of a mindless few.

It is clear that the objective of restoring the Ulster Way to Downpatrick and Rowallane has been on the organisationrsquos lsquoto-dorsquo list for far too long. Now is the time for action, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Walker said councillors now need to ensure that what he described as this ldquovital project is prioritised on a cross-departmental basis to have any hope of success within a reasonable timescale.ldquoIt is vitally important three separate council departments get involved moving forward. Delamont Country Park offers huge potential and re-establishing a network of community trails is an exciting proposal which we hope will come to fruition, he said.ldquoThe response from the public to have its say on the future of the park was brilliant and thanks to everyone who took the time to take part in what was a very worthwhile event. I initially lobbied for more investment in the park and am glad local council officials took this on board and are developing a masterplan with public input at its heart.Cllr Andrews said he was pleased to take part in last weekrsquos consultation and was impressed at how many people took the time to attend, confirming he will be supporting the motion and views outdoor leisure as an economic driver for the whole region.ldquoThe people who attended last weekrsquos event agree that the country park is a major tourism asset and offers signicant development potential which must be appropriate and not spoil what is already in place, he continued.ldquoDelamont can act as a major economic driver and benefit not just the immediate killyleagh area, but the wider district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Rogue trader tried to swindle £7k from Newcastle pensioner  ","story":"A FRAUDSTER tried to scam an  year-old Newcastle woman out of nearly pound, for tarmacing her driveway which he had deliberately damaged, Downpatrick Court has heard.Dean James Winderstood shamefaced in the court on Thursday on five charges relating to work he carried out in February.Winder, who traded as Unique Style Driveways, admitted one charge of fraud by misrepresentation and three further charges of aggressive, misleading, and unfair commercial practice.He was also admitted using an inaccurate service flyer which failed to say that his business was registered in England.All offences took place between February -.The court heard that the scam may never have been uncovered had it not have been for the actions of a taxi driver.Police praised the driver who raised the alarm with the Trading Standards Service after he learnt of what was happening as he brought the woman to a bank to withdraw pound,.Trading Standards called the police who arrested Winder and another person at the scene.Winder was given  hours of community service and fined pound by District Judge Amanda Brady for his actions, which were later condemned by police as ldquodisgusting.He was also instructed to immediately pay back pound, which he had taken from the woman as a deposit.A prosecution lawyer said that Winder approached the woman and her partner unsolicitedly to power wash and seal a paved area at their Mourneview Road home for pound.However, after doing the work, Winder pointed out some problems with the driveway and offered to do further work for pound,, which was increased to pound, to tarmac the full driveway.Some of the problems that Winder had pointed out in the driveway were those he had actually created while doing the first job, the prosecutor added.A defence lawyer acknowledged that Winder, now with an address at Holmes Avenue, Dreghorn in Irvine, Scotland, had seen an opportunity to get further work from the elderly couple and had done a ldquopoor job of tarmacing the driveway.However, he said Winder had made a full admission for his actions, offered his apologies and had turned up in court with the full amount of money to be ed to the elderly householder.The lawyer added that while there was another man involved in the work and transaction, Winder was ing the money on his own.Judge Brady described Winderrsquos actions as ldquomean-spirited. She told him: ldquoYou took advantage of an elderly person, quite deliberately, and deliberately damaged her driveway to get more money.Winderrsquos conviction was later welcomed by the police.Chief Superintendent Simon Walls said: ldquoThis was a callous and calculated act by Winder who deliberately set out to scam this couple out of their hard-earned money.ldquoWhat Winder did was disgusting and I hope the courtrsquos judgement will bring some level of comfort and reassurance to the couple.ldquoI would also like to praise the taxi driver who raised the alarm and thank our colleagues in Trading Standards Service.Chief Superintendent Walls also appealed to friends and family of older or vulnerable people to talk to them about lsquocold callersrsquo and make sure they know what to do when salespeople come to their door.He added: ldquoNot all cold callers are rogue traders, but some are. If you feel that something isnrsquot quite right, it usually isnrsquot.ldquoUnofficial traders can overcharge unsuspecting and often older householders for poor quality work, or work that is never completed at all.ldquoRemember, itrsquos your home and itrsquos OK not to open the dooryou have any concerns.

Keenan quickly tagged on a rsquo with two Morgan frees stretching the lead to four points by the th minute.Ballymartin were far from playing the role of bystanders, but they managed to shoot seven wides against the wind, misses that proved crucial at the finish.With  minutes gone Chris McKay had a stinging shot crash off the crossbar following a stunning passage of play, but Keenan and Morgan ensured St Johnrsquos kept ticking over with points apiece.Ballymartin continued to waste several good scoring opportunities before Michael Higgins picked up his sidersquos first score in added time at the end of the first half as St Johnrsquos went in with a - to - lead.It took the protagonists a while to settle in after the break, but with  minutes gone Cathal Doyle reduced the arrears to four points with a score from play. St Johnrsquos then cruelly lost the services of the influential Eoin Moag to a black card and minutes later he was followed for an early bath by Darren Savage, who received a second yellow and then red.St Johnrsquos backs were now to the wall and Ballymartin made sure they stayed there. However, another Morgan free stretched St Johnrsquos lead to - to - before the real Ballymartin fightback started.Consecutive points from Michael Cunningham, Ryan OrsquoHareand Ross Cunningham left a single point in it and Ballymartin were in the right tack.The Lilywhites pushed and probed for the equalising score, but with the game in added time St Johnrsquos broke free and a surging run from Conor Flanagan ended with him setting up Branf for the match-winning score.Just to rub salt into the wounds, Morgan added a point from play to leave St Johnrsquos with their Division  status intact.St Johnrsquos: D Morgan, C Magorrian, A Morgan, J Addis, D Savage, R Flanagan, M Grant, A McMullan, E Moag, C Brannf , C Morgan , C McKay, M Keenan , J Clarke, C Flanagan.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We also believe there are opportunities to provide post-mortem findings more quickly and enhance the support and information families receive.“While it is acknowledged that a service outside of Northern Ireland is not what we would wish for, working closely with a much larger centre such as Alder Hey will provide a more robust service in the interim period.”Ms Reid continued: “We are working closely with families, staff, charities and other partners to take every possible step to ensure that any baby or child who requires a post-mortem is treated with the utmost respect, dignity and sensitivity throughout their journey now and in the future and that families will have our full support when facing these very traumatic circumstances.“In the meantime, the wider Health and Social Care system will continue to exhaust all efforts to try to ensure that a local service can be provided in Northern Ireland in the longer term.”It is expected that new arrangements will be implemented from January .Briton dies after being bitten by rabid cat Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Nothing can ever prepare you for it and even years after it, their loss remains with you for every hour of every day.“I lost my son Jake when he was only  years and  days old in . Unfortunately I know from bitter experience how hard it is for parents to face delays for a post-mortem - my husband and I were forced to wait an extra  days in order for a specialist to be found.“That delay only made a nightmare even more dficult for us so I’m furious that the experience we were forced to go through will now be imposed upon so many more parents in Northern Ireland.“For the HSCB to even be looking at using technology such as an app, to allow parents to follow their child’s remains as they make the journey to England and back, demonstrates the sheer-cruelty and inhumanity of what is being proposed.“Whereas funerals in Northern Ireland usually take place  days after death, in England it is more typical to have a period of up to a week or even longer. The time between a death and the funeral taking place is especially traumatic so I am concerned that parents here will be forced to endure even longer delays as they have no choice but to follow the usual time-frames across the water.“There has been no accountable leadership in the local health service for almost two years, and with almost , HSC vacancies at present parents who have gone through one of the most traumatic experiences imaginable will now shortly again be directly impacted by the total abdication of political leadership in Northern Ireland.“I’ve spent recent months campaigning for the Children’s Funeral Fund for England, under which parents will no longer have to meet the costs of burials or cremations, to be extended to Northern Ireland but every corner I take I am told it can’t happen in the absence of a local Minister. The current political situation in this country is a total disgrace and utterly scandalous.“As a local Councillor I am disgusted, I am angry and I feel ashamed that this is even happening. This cannot be allowed to continue.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She is set to take part in her second overseas trek for the charity next year to Vietnam, with husband Dave.Hannah Leckie, community fundraiser for Cardf and the Vale, said: ldquoThank you so much to everyone who conquered the coals to raise vital funds for Marie Curie and those who turned out to support everyone taking part.ldquoEvents like this are essential in helping us continue to raise vital funds to provide care and support for people when they need it most.Cakes were donated for the event by Memory Lane Cakes at the Finsbury Food Group, while Sue from Burger Palace had hot dogs and burgers cooking for participants and their supporters throughout the night.The amount raised from the event is still being counted up.Marie Curie provides round-the-clock care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families at its hospice on Bridgeman Road in the town.The charity also provides a Hospice at Home service and has a team of clinical nurse specialists in the Vale who provide support such as symptom control and pain management.To find out how you can get involved in challenges and fundraising for Marie Curie, visit www.mariecurie.org.uk get-involved. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/albion_1.jpg","title":"new apartment building for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew  A new £m apartment building could be built in Belfast city centre amid early development plans, Ulster Business can reveal.

Those behind the scheme, which could be worth around £m, say around  construction jobs would be created at the peak of the build. A pre-application event is due to take place at the nearby Holiday Inn on November . Ciaran Deazley, project architect from Like Architects said: \"The Albion development seeks to provide a landmark building for inner city living. It has been designed as two buildings connected by a landscaped square, the high quality brick and glass facade will bring a contemporary presence and vibrancy to the area.\" It’s one of several major schemes under way across the city. Elsewhere, McAleer  Rushe wants to build a nine to -storey building, to include around  apartments, and  car park spaces. It would be based at a partially cleared site at Corporation Street.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Oly-1.jpg","title":"titanic quarter office scheme out for tender","story":"Posted on Tuesday  November  by Ulster Business A huge office scheme for the Titanic Quarter has taken a step forward as the development is put out for tender.
