claimed it was due to the General Election tomorrow. Buckingham Palace has not commented.  Andrew agreed to withdraw from public duty but initially wanted to remain a figurehead for Pitch@Palace, some 200 charities and other affiliations.          Tonight is the organisation\u0027s first event since the Duke of York was grilled on his relationship with convicted US paedophile Jeffrey Epstein (mugshot pictured) At the end of his disastrous interview with Emily Maitlis he said he planned to continue with Pitch@Palace and his other business schemes.  But he was forced to back down afters several sponsors made it clear they no longer wanted his backing.The organisation is believed to be dropping \u0027Palace\u0027 from its name.  At least 23 organisations have either dropped the Duke or accepted his resignation, including the English National Ballet, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Outward Bound Trust. In the immediate fallout, one of the country\u0027s leading accountancy firms, KPMG, revealed it had stopped sponsoring Pitch@Palace to protect its reputation.KPMG bosses decided to end the relationship last month due to \u0027unsavoury\u0027 issues stemming from the Duke\u0027s friendship with Epstein. The firm was a founding partner and had paid up to £100,000 a year in sponsorship since 2014.  Several other major companies and charities said they were also considering their links with Andrew in the wake of his extraordinary television interview about the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.The pharmaceutical giant Astrazeneca said it was reviewing its relationship with Pitch@Palace, while insurance firm Aon asked for its name be removed from the scheme\u0027s website. Aon sources insisted that the company is not associated with the Duke\u0027s scheme and that the supposed relationship had been publicised in error.                  At the end of his disastrous interview with Emily Maitlis he said he planned to continue with Pitch@Palace and

passport doctored hooked nose","story":"Share this article Ms Hernroth-Rothstein explained that the photo had been taken at the police station and printed on the passport and ID card a few days

of a \u0027computer glitch\u0027, she acknowledged it could be \u0027something technical\u0027 but said staff should still have noticed.          Angered: Annika Hernroth-Rothstein (pictured) says the

had filed an official complaint with police. The hooked nose has been a racist stereotype of Jewish people for centuries. \u0027I felt scared and kinda dirty when seeing it, but accepted the ID, went home and put it in a box never to be used,\u0027 she said. \u0027I showed it to a non-Jewish friend and he got so upset and sickened that I ended up posting it,\u0027 she explained on Saturday. \u0027I do wish I would have reacted there and then but I didn’t feel very tough at that moment and just went home with it, and put it away. \u0027Sometimes it takes someone else seeing something and reacting to it for you to understand that your feelings and reactions are valid.\u0027 She also took aim at Twitter users who doubted her story, saying Jews were \u0027scared to say something\u0027 because of the likely backlash.  Responding to an enquiry by Metro.co.uk, Swedish police said they were investigating the claim. Spokesman Magnus Roglert said police were probing whether the image was doctored or whether it might have been distorted accidentally. \u0027We will, of course, take a closer look at the matter and we therefore ask the person to contact us as soon as possible,\u0027 he said.   \u0027\u0027We are back-tracking the matter to see if a manipulation has happened or if the image just is distorted by shadows andor bad resolution. \u0027It\u0027s all

I just talked and talked. It was wonderful.’In addition to the scores of television programmes, he wrote more than 45 books, and starred in a Ribena commercial.He also had a Top 40 hit with Brontosaurus, Will You Wait For Me? and appeared on Jim’ll Fix It. Something he regretted.‘I didn’t like Savile. He was always telling me I should become a DJ because I’d make a lot more money. And why did he pick his nose like that?

In 1996 he let rip against wind farms (‘because they don’t work’) during one of his regular appearances on Blue Peter: ‘That was the beginning really. From that moment, I was not welcome at the BBC.’The killer blow came when he was dropped by The Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts, of which he was president and with whom he had worked for more than 50 years. They didn’t even tell him —he read about it in the newspapers.It was no surprise that he became sceptical of many of the conservation groups he had once enthusiastically endorsed.‘The World Wildlife Fund might have saved a few pandas, but what about the forests? What have Greenpeace done?,’ he railed in one interview.         As a young man he worked in an ink factory and as a plumber before studying and later teaching botany at Durham UniversityOf course, his position on climate change contrasted starkly with that of Sir David Attenborough who has been vocal in his belief that rising temperatures represent an existential threat to the planet.But Bellamy bore him no animus. ‘You can’t knock him, he’s done a fantastic job of opening people’s eyes . . . but we’re different. He’s a natural history man and I’m a campaigner.’David James Bellamy was born in London in 1933 and was raised in Sutton, Surrey. As a child he suffered from a kidney condition that should have killed him — he later revealed that he overheard the hospital sister tell his mother: ‘He won’t be with us tomorrow.’There were other narrow escapes — two bombs fell on their house during World War II.As a young man he worked in an ink factory and as a plumber before studying and later teaching botany at Durham University.He achieved wider recognition following his work on the Torrey Canyon oil spill in 1967 when the tanker ran aground off the Cornish coast causing an environmental catastrophe.TV work followed, launching his small-screen career, and thanks to his distinctive voice and screen presence, Bellamy quickly became a popular presenter. In 1979 he won Bafta’s Richard Dimbleby Award.At his peak, he was one of the most respected and sought-after experts in his field and although his ban from TV screens saddened him, he wasn’t bitter.‘When I was at the BBC, I could do whatever I wanted. In those days, you could say what you liked. You can’t now. The world’s gone bonkers,’ he said.         He achieved wider recognition following his work on the Torrey Canyon oil spill in 1967 when the tanker ran aground off the Cornish coast causing an environmental catastropheRecalling those TV years, he said: ‘I only ever filmed in the holidays, so my family could all come with me, which nearly bankrupted me.’It was quite a family.‘We were always going to have two children of our own and adopt two, but we lost our first five children before our son Rufus was born . . . So we adopted the next four, from all round the world, and they’re wonderful.’His wife Rosemary — who died last year — was his rock, the love of his life. They met when he was just 17 and were married 60 years.She was also very understanding of her husband’s interests. They had 32 different species of pet, including a crocodile. ‘I brought it back from Australia — you couldn’t do that now.’And he had no regrets.He told the Mail: ‘I’m the world’s luckiest man — I‘ve stood on top of the world and I married a wonderful woman.’He also inspired a generation with his love of the natural world.

It is also a nod to how competitive the market is getting.”Last week, Amazon successfully livestreamed its first 10 Premier League matches. The matches were accessible to subscribers to Amazon’s Prime service, which costs £7.99 a month or £79 a year, or were free to new customers on a 30-day trial. Amazon has said the two days on which matches were streamed set new records for the most signups to Prime since it was launched in the UK in 2007.Pete Oliver, the managing director of marketing at BT Consumer, said: “Customers can sign up on a flexible monthly basis for the first time.“Monthly pass forms part of BT’s ambition to offer BT Sport customers unrivalled choice and the highest-quality broadcasts on even more devices and platforms.”Sky began offering sport and entertainment on a pay-as-you-go basis seven years ago through its streaming service Now TV. The broadcaster has a range of daily, weekly and monthly passes without the need for a Sky TV subscription.Sky’s monthly sports pass is priced at £33.99. Offering a monthly pass has not resulted in a rush of cancellations by its core pay-TV base of about 10 million subscribers instead, it has primarily attracted a new set of “pay-lite” customers.Broughton said: “It is more risky offering sports monthly than film and TV content, because the timing of events opens the door to viewers waiting just for specific matches and then churning.“Given the high price of sports rights, it is a risky bet. Sky’s Now TV has mitigated the risk of contract customers moving to a ‘dip in and dip out’ culture by pricing the sports pass quite high in recognition that consumers have to pay for flexibility.”Netflix and Amazon have swiftly attracted 20 million UK subscribers between them. Last year, the number of subscribers to streaming services overtook those signed up to pay-TV providers such as Sky, BT, TalkTalk and Virgin Media for the first time.Monthly cost of streaming services and pay-TV passesSky Sports pass – £33.99, reduced to £20 for the first two monthsAmazon Prime Video – £7.99, or £79 a year (includes fast delivery, music streaming and other Prime member benefits)BBC TV licence – £12.90 or £154.50 annually"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44e6ed7e92fcaa81d98d4de94dd9a8e688b7ce3a/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6272005257ce1d5984b01986c45623d7","title":"saudi aramco touches 2tn in value on second day of trading","story":"World’s biggest listed company briefly reaches valuation sought by Saudi ruler Saudi Aramco has touched a market value of $2tn a day after the Saudi state-backed oil company made its stock market debut.Shares rose from Wednesday’s close of 35.2 Saudi riyals to a high of 38.7 riyals before easing back to 37.3 riyals.The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had sought a $2tn valuation for Aramco, but international investors balked at the price in light of lower oil prices, climate change concerns and geopolitical risks.The float was marketed almost exclusively in Saudi Arabia and across the Middle East after receiving a tepid response from international investors, who have also been wary of Aramco’s close ties to the Saudi regime amid human rights concerns following the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The Saudi government encouraged Middle Eastern state funds and wealthy Saudi families to support the IPO.

It’s high time its institutions – including the media – woke up to that fact. In 2016, both the United Kingdom and the United States were the targets of Russian efforts to swing their votes. The aim was to weaken the alliances that had constrained Vladimir Putin’s ambitions, such as the European Union and Nato.The efforts in both countries had much in common. They were aided by a transatlantic cast of characters loosely organised around the Trump and Brexit campaigns. Many of them worked in concert and interacted with Russians close to the Kremlin. The outcome in both countries was also eerily similar. Both countries have been at war with themselves in the three years since, pulling them back from the international stage at a time when Putin has consolidated his position in Crimea, Ukraine, Syria and beyond.Our Washington-based research firm, Fusion GPS, conducted much of the early investigations into Russia’s support of the Trump campaign, aided by our colleague Christopher Steele, the former head of MI6’s Russia desk. While our initial focus was on Russian meddling in US politics, it has since become increasingly clear that Britain’s political system has also been deeply affected by Russian influence operations.There the similarities end. For the past three years, the US has undergone a messy and boisterous effort to understand the extent of Russian influence on the 2016 election and beyond. There have been multiple congressional investigations with the power to compel documents and testimony from witnesses. There was a two-year investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller.After mostly ignoring the issue during the election campaign itself, the US media have made up for lost time by digging deeply into Russian interference and the extent of the Trump campaign’s complicity.All of these investigations have been imperfect. The congressional investigations often devolved into farce as Trump’s political allies decided to investigate the investigators instead of Russia’s attack. The Mueller report’s damning findings were obfuscated by lawyerly language and twisted beyond recognition by Trump’s loyal attorney general. Mueller interpreted his mandate narrowly, leaving crucial questions unanswered.But the process did produce an avalanche of documents and testimony, a great deal of it public, that has aided understanding of what occurred. That makes it harder for Russia to reprise its attack. The Mueller report’s main finding – that Russia had engaged in a “sweeping and systematic” campaign to elect Trump – was unambiguous and thoroughly documented. So too was Mueller’s clarion call for Americans of all political persuasions to wake up to the continuing threat of Russian interference in its politics.In Britain, the official response has consisted largely of denial. Consumed by bitter isions over Brexit and public spending, it took years longer than it should have for parliament to conduct an investigation of Russian penetration of British politics. Even now, the government has suppressed its findings until after the election – an unconscionable decision given the importance to the democratic system itself.Many US institutions have shown more backbone and independence than their UK counterparts. Some of those who served in the Trump administration, such as the British-born Fiona Hill and Lt Col Alexander Vindman, have been willing to stand up in public and tell the truth, despite intimidation from the president and his allies. In the UK, the courageous whistleblowers needed to expose Russian influence have yet to emerge.The UK media have started prying into these issues and important work has been conducted shedding light on the actions of Russian-backed groups such as the Conservative Friends of Russia. But, in general, news organisations have been slow off the mark, stymied by dwindling resources and overloaded by the hurricane of Brexit news. Britain’s onerous libel laws and its culture of official secrecy have only made matters worse.In both the US and the UK, there’s an understandable tendency by those helped by Russian efforts to minimise the perception of this influence. Conservative-leaning media in both countries see little advantage in uncovering Russian meddling that would appear to undercut their own political preferences. In the US, some of Trump’s defenders have even resorted to parroting Russian propaganda that falsely shifts the blame for their interference to rivals in Ukraine.The British official instinct to handle these unpleasant matters in private has not served it well. The public cannot have confidence that the political establishment will deal with these thorny issues any better than it has with Brexit.In short, Britain needs its own Mueller report: a full, independent and public accounting of Russian efforts to interfere in its politics. Few people will look forward to this process in a country already exhausted from fighting over Brexit. But it’s essential to halt Russia’s attack on Britain’s democracy and restore confidence in its politics.Putin will not be easily deterred. Russia’s economy is smaller than Italy’s, with little prospect of growth so long as it suffers under his kleptocracy. The only option to become relatively stronger, Putin believes, is to ide and weaken his adversaries. However, Putin is not the Wizard of Oz. He cannot invent underlying political currents he can only intensify them.This is the biggest danger we face: that we cannot escape our partisanship long enough to face down our common enemy. Putin is not a Conservative nor is he a Republican. The next time he interferes it could easily be in favour of their political opponents. Britain’s institutions must wake up to the Russian threat before Putin seriously damages the country’s centuries-old democracy.• Glenn R Simpson and Peter Fritsch, both former journalists, are the founders of the research firm Fusion GPS.

Which is why there was something cathartic about the moment that Lee Anderson, Tory parliamentary candidate for Ashfield, donned a black cagoule, stared into a mobile phone camera, and – with a zeal too seldom witnessed in contemporary politics – introduced himself to the wider world with a denunciation of “nuisance tenants”.“These people, who have to live somewhere, let’s have them in a tent in the middle of a field,” he grimaced. “Six o’clock every morning, let’s have them up.” Hood raised, face red, wind howling around him: Anderson looked every inch like the sadistic PE teacher of your nightmares – which, to be fair, feels like the right look for anyone advocating for the establishment of forced labour camps. “Let’s have them in the field, picking potatoes,” he continued, “back in the tent, cold shower, lights out, six o’clock, same again the next day.”Why not? Those on the wrong side of the ide that has riven Britain across a decade of post-crash politics have grown accustomed to insecurity and discipline – both at the hands of the market, which has placed many of the fundamental building blocks of a secure and dignified life out of reach, and the state, which has unleashed a blizzard of cuts and sanctions upon anyone falling short. Wearily familiar, too, is Anderson’s moralising tone: the decent man whose patience has finally run out, knuckles whitening with the strain of preventing his contempt for late capitalism’s losers getting the better of him.So for most young people – and increasingly, many in middle age and beyond as well – the only recourse available is to the private rented sector, where vast asymmetries of power between landlord and tenant mean that the latter can be evicted on a whim with only two months’ notice. Even in the best of properties, that profound, amorphous precarity takes a toll on everyone, not least the nearly two million privately-renting households with children, or the one in three millennials who are on course to remain private tenants all the way into old age.Most properties, of course, are anything but the best of them. Generation Rent, a national campaign group, has just been running a #VentYourRent exercise encouraging private tenants to share their experiences. Scroll through the testimonies and you’ll see stories of overcrowding, dodgy electrics, rat infestations and rogue landlord bullying fill every page. For the privilege of watching black mould bloom, renters are paying three times more on housing as a proportion of their income than their grandparents did.Recognising the scale of the problem, Labour has put landlord regulation and rent controls at the heart of its manifesto – a sharp distinction from both the Conservatives, who have vowed to strengthen landlords’ rights and failed to build a single one of the 200,000 new “starter homes” they promised in 2015. The Liberal Democrats’ loan to rent scheme, meanwhile, involving the extension of government-backed tenancy deposit loans to new renters under the age of 30 already likely to be saddled with a mountain of debt, has generated widespread mirth on social media (“They really are the Woke Landlords party,” observed one critic on Twitter).Labour’s position is the culmination of pressure from a new wave of housing movements and private renters’ unions, including Generation Rent but also local activist communities like the London Renters Union and Acorn, who collaborated on a groundbreaking Renter Manifesto for the election. The Residential Landlords Association has warned that the party’s plans would provoke a “serious rental housing crisis”, seemingly unaware that this is a perfect description of what we are living through right now.Like the footage that emerged earlier this year showing a Tory cabinet minister in black tie grabbing a young, female climate crisis protester by the neck, Anderson’s intervention was starkly illuminating: it underscored the fact that this election offers a dramatic choice between one party who understand that things cannot stay the way they are, and another who are unapologetic about defending the status quo.As things stand, the beneficiaries of that status quo are those who control, trade and live off existing assets and are thus liberated from dependence on the productive economy – including hedge funds, private equity firms and other purveyors of footloose, financialised capital, but also those who own their own homes outright or earn an income from pension funds, as well as actual landlords. The far bigger group that is losing out encompasses not only private tenants, but everyone reliant on wages and public spending for survival, not to mention all those who would prefer not to see the planet burn.There are, of course, a great many older people in the first category who, seeking an insurance policy against the spiralling costs of social care, are understandably protective of their assets and wary of radical change. Labour’s challenge is to convince them that efforts to rebalance the economy will improve rather than diminish their lives in the years to come, and that curbing the domination of market logic – in housing, as well as many other areas of society – will bring immense benefits to their children, grandchildren and the wider community as well.This election represents a reckoning at the ballot box: between rentier interests on the one side, and a more hopeful, equitable alternative on the other. The majority of Britain’s tenants, be they renting from the council or privately, will be praying that it leaves Anderson with time on his hands come Friday morning. If he’s looking for something to do, picking vegetables in a field would be a great start.• Jack Shenker is a writer based in London and Cairo.

Von der Leyen wants a €100bn (£84bn) fund of public and private money to help countries abandon fossil fuels, in addition to a plan from the European Investment Bank to incentivise €1tn of green investment between 2021 and 2030.But EU member states are stuck over the sequencing of the 2050 target and money. The three central European countries want generous and precise promises of EU funds before they sign up to the target. France, Germany, the Netherlands and other net payers into the EU budget think the climate pledge comes first, as they do not wish to preempt discussions on the EU’s next seven-year budget, due to be concluded in 2020.The European Green Deal is the EU’s answer to what the European commission’s new president, Ursula von der Leyen, called the “existential issue” of the climate emergency. Most EU countries have signed up to goal of a climate neutral EU by 2050, a goal demanding dramatic change in energy use, farming, housing, transport, trade and diplomacy.The European Green Deal is only the start of the journey: laws will have to be drafted and agreed by EU ministers and MEPs money will have to be raised plans will have to be implemented. It is a route map, rather than a destination, and time is running out.But the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, is seen by some diplomats as the biggest wild card. Babiš is under pressure at home, after an EU audit leaked earlier this month revealed he was in conflict of interest over EU funds received by his Agrofert conglomerate. The Czech prime minister was one of the strongest voices against the 2050 target in June the latest negative report from Brussels on his business interests is seen as making him an unpredictable player in the debate.Reaching an agreement will also be crucial for Charles Michel, who is chairing his first EU leaders’ summit, since becoming European council president this month. Officials have been wrangling over a summit communique to create what one source called “a smart linguistic solution” to get everyone on board. The latest draft summit conclusions seen by the  call for an “enabling framework” to support “a cost-effective, just, as well as socially balanced and fair transition taking into account different national circumstances”.Climate activists argue that a promise on the 2050 target alone is not enough and want the EU to set a more demanding emissions reduction target for 2030.“The world is on fire and our governments are letting it burn,” said Greenpace’s EU director, Jorgo Riss, in a statement. “It’s not enough for them to commit to a climate neutral EU in 2050. The presidents and prime ministers in Brussels today will be long gone by then. What counts even more is the urgent action they take now, while they are in power.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce5335926ded0d0e4f2abb0668b29002dd88f7b/0_227_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eadafc920f8d383a4afd8b1a184ef59","title":"harvey weinstein settlement women","story":"If approved, settlement would bring most of the civil lawsuits pending against him to an endMore than 30 women who were allegedly subjected to sexual misconduct by the disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein have reportedly reached a $25m settlement which, if approved, would bring to an end most of the civil lawsuits pending against him.Harvey Weinstein himself would not have to pay a penny to his accusers or have to admit wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement, the Times reports. The lack of personal accountability for the former movie producer has caused expressions of disappointment and anger from several of the women involved, though parties to the negotiations insist that the legal options open to them were limited.“I don’t love it, but I don’t know how to go after him. I don’t know what I can really do,” the actor Katherine Kendall, who was allegedly sexually harassed by Weinstein in 1993, told the paper.The pending settlement in the multiple civil lawsuits is by no means the end of Weinstein’s legal woes. On 6 January his criminal trial is scheduled to open with jury selection in a Manhattan court.The criminal charges against him include the alleged rape of a woman in 2013 and an accusation of forced oral sex on a similarly unnamed woman in 2006. Weinstein has denied any claim of nonconsensual sex, criminal or civil.In August Weinstein was also charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault to allow a third woman, the actor Annabella Sciorra, to testify about an alleged rape in 1993. Though the statute of limitations has passed in that incident, prosecutors hope her testimony will demonstrate a pattern of behavior on the part of the defendant that will help secure his conviction.Weinstein has been free on bail since his arrest in May 2018. On Wednesday his bail conditions were raised from $1m to $5m after the prosecution accused him of tampering with his electronic ankle monitor.Lawyers for Weinstein, who arrived at court on Wednesday walking with the use of a frame, had claimed the irregular handling of the bracelet was innocently caused by “technical glitches”.The pending settlement in the civil lawsuits was revealed by Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, the two New York Times reporters who first broke the news of Weinstein’s long history of alleged sexual misconduct in October 2017, sparking the #MeToo movement. The reporters went on to be awarded a Pulitzer prize and to write a bestselling book on the subject, She Said.Aspects of the tentative deal will probably be contentious and have already prompted angry responses from some of Weinstein’s alleged victims. In particular, more than $12m out of a total $47m package to close the Weinstein Company’s affairs would feed back to Weinstein himself along with his brother, Bob, and other board members to contribute to legal costs.According to the Times, two women involved in civil suits against the former producer, Alexandra Canosa and Wedil David, have refused to join the settlement and are challenging it.In a statement, Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for David, said: “We reject the notion that this was the best settlement that could have been achieved on behalf of the victims. It is shameful that $12m of the settlement is going to the lawyers for the directors who we alleged enabled Harvey Weinstein.”He added: “We plan to vigorously object to any provision that tries to bind victims who want to proceed with holding Harvey Weinstein accountable for his actions which is exactly what we intend to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b25364da855d284fd4c9beae1ed4b3e68318667/0_154_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dedfdcb34e4c8bc4b899f66bc6f251ed","title":"best films 2019 uk no 7 once upon a time in hollywood","story":"Quentin Tarantino’s masterful projection of 1960s LA may rewrite history, but is saturated with his love of the eraNot much stands between us and the Netflix-inspired bonfire of the cinemagoing experience: even titans such as Martin Scorsese have succumbed, caught between the pressing needs of escalating production budgets and shrinking box-office expectations. To give him his due, Quentin Tarantino is not going down without a fight. This is a director who prizes the actual projection of celluloid on large silver screens – and, in fact, one of the most enjoyable sequences in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood follows starlet Sharon Tate into a movie-theatre showing of the spy comedy The Wrecking Crew, in which she appeared opposite Dean Martin. From the lobby cards to the upholstery to the glittering beams of light, Tarantino offers a lovingly detailed homage to the act of film-watching as it was practised in late 1960s Los Angeles.Tarantino isn’t only interested in the big screen, though much of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is just as concerned with the industrial-scale production of the kind of TV shows that fuelled the everyday entertainment habits of Americans. (Tarantino, six years old at the time the film is set, would no doubt have soaked up countless shows like Bounty Law, the fictitious western serial of which Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the star.) Not only does Tarantino create superbly realised extended sequences of a real-life show, Lancer, in which Dalton has a guest-star bad-hat role he also films hilarious versions of TV ephemera: on-set interviews, commercial spots and the like.The symbiotic Hollywood connection between TV and film is spelled out in Dalton’s career quandary: should he stick it out in La La Land, or head over to Italy, Clint Eastwood-style, where a casting agent (Al Pacino) can get him work in spaghetti westerns. (Not Sergio Leone – Tarantino’s personal favourite, Sergio Corbucci, gets the namecheck here.) Tarantino’s connoisseurship ranges widely: we get a glimpse of the Joe Namath biker pic CC and Company, an encounter with Bruce Lee on the set of The Green Hornet (Tarantino got a lot of grief from Lee’s daughter Shannon for having his movie Lee first threaten and then get a kicking from Brad Pitt’s stuntman character), and shelves full of comics and merch of the era.Tarantino’s masterstroke, though, is to connect this Hollywood life with the Spahn ranch, the former TV set where the Manson family set up shop. It’s there where Pitt’s Cliff Booth, an acquaintance of the owner George Spahn (in real life notoriously pacified by sex with Manson’s female acolytes), confronts the family en masse, and realises their less than benevolent intent.For approximately the first two-thirds of the film, this is great stuff (the Bruce Lee scene aside, which is pretty funny even if it is a travesty). It’s that ending that in my view that lets Once Upon a Time in Hollywood down. Tarantino’s predilection for wish-fulfilment rearrangement of history has let him down before – surely I can’t be the only person who sees the ending of Inglourious Basterds, when Hitler and Goebbels are murdered in a cinema, as just as tasteless as – SPOILER ALERT – Booth and Dalton’s offing of Manson’s crew of murderous hippies, slasher-movie style. Certain critics have panned Tarantino’s view of the hippie era as regressive – that is certainly the case, but he is entitled to his point of view. It’s the boneheadedness of thinking it’s fine to replace harsh reality with glib film-nerd narratives that means this film is only good, rather than great."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ee60a90bc6aa624a3107dcc1165ef1155c6ffc5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=961b64a604a9cecd4cd88d4703ba23c7","title":"crass and contemptible is clint eastwoods new movie built on a lie","story":"Oscar-tipped drama Richard Jewell, the story of the security guard falsely accused of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing, has come under fire for suggesting a journalist traded sex for FBI tipsClint Eastwood’s indignant, Oscar-buzzed new drama Richard Jewell tasks itself with a noble and initially justifiable aim: to tell the truth about a man whose name has been unfairly slandered. It’s written, quite literally, on the poster with the words “true” and “truth” promising, at long last, facts behind the headlines that followed the tragic bombing at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. But there’s a catch.In an attempt to clear the name of Jewell, the security guard wrongfully accused of creating and planting the pipe bomb that directly killed one person and injured 111 others, the film throws another name under the bus, that of Kathy Scruggs, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution journalist who broke the story that he was under investigation. Its recent premiere at the AFI festival was accompanied by unease over a scene where Scruggs trades sex for a tip from an FBI agent, a damaging allegation that’s yet to be supported by any tangible evidence. To complicate matters further, Scruggs isn’t able to give her side of the story. She died in 2001 from an overdose of prescription drugs at the age of 42.“I was stunned,” AJC’s current editor-in-chief, Kevin Riley, who attended last month’s premiere, said to the . “No one has ever said Kathy did anything like that.”Initial outrage over the scene recently gave way to the threat of legal action, with the AJC choosing to hire the high-powered Hollywood lawyer Marty Singer, a man the New York Times once referred to as the “guard dog of the stars”. He drafted a letter aimed at Warner Bros and screenwriter Billy Ray, calling out the film’s depiction of Scruggs and her colleagues as “extraordinarily reckless” and imploring the studio to add a disclaimer to the film along with a public statement. He warned that if they choose to disregard this, a lawsuit will follow.The story of Jewell, played on-screen by the BlacKkKlansman and I, Tonya star Paul Walter Hauser, is one of undeniable frustration, of an innocent, if over-eager, law enforcement hopeful whose bravery was warped into something darker by the FBI who thrust him to the top of their list of suspects for a gruelling 88-day period. His public transformation from hero to villain serves as a cautionary tale for the authorities and the media, a call for caution in how cases of such gravity are handled.In the film, produced by Leonardo DiCaprio, he’s painted as a sympathetic victim, a well-intentioned, if naive, patriot while the agent on his tail, played by Jon Hamm but based on an amalgamation of real-life characters, and journalist close behind, played by Olivia Wilde, are both the clear villains. In reviews of the film, Wilde’s portrayal of Scruggs has been referred to as an “aggressive, unethical” reporter possessing a “sultry greediness” who was “ruthless, manipulative” and who “all but looks at the camera and says, ‘I am the bad guy in this movie’”. It’s a raucous, vampish, overtly sexual performance that sees Scruggs complain about covering the Olympics, calling it a “fucking nightmare” while complaining that it doesn’t get her “hard” without any crime occurring.“She was one of the better reporters I ever worked with,” her former reporting partner Ron Martz has said of Scruggs. “She was really tough and hard-nosed. When she went after a story she did what was necessary to get the story, within legal and ethical bounds.”The offending scene sees Scruggs slithering up to Hamm’s fictional FBI agent in a garishly lit bar, seeking a scoop. After being stonewalled, she claims she already knows the bureau is looking into somebody via sources. “Well Kathy, if you couldn’t fuck it out of them then what makes you think you can fuck it out of me?” he says.She scoffs, leaning in closer to him, caressing his inner thigh. He expresses concern over the case being jeopardised by leaked information but she tells him she would never go to print without a second verified source and that “would put us in a very different zone, as you know”, she purrs. “What kind of zone?” he asks. “We have to find out” she replies, leaning closer. After he reveals that the FBI is looking into Jewell, she calls him a “fat fuck who lives with his mother”.“This kind of puts a clock on things though,” she adds. “You want to get a room or just go to my car?”“This is happening?” he asks.“This is happening,” she confirms.“Well let’s get the fuck out of here then,” he says and the pair leave.The following scene, the morning after, has Scruggs sauntering into the office to her colleague Martz, asking him to do “one of those better word things” that he does, rewriting her copy as “you know I kinda write like a brick”. It’s all very dramatically juicy and firmly places Scruggs and her techniques in an easily definable amoral zone but it’s an encounter that remains entirely unverified.“If they had actually contacted me it might have ruined their idea of what they wanted the story to be,” Martz said recently to the AJC. “It’s obvious to me they did not go to any great lengths to find out what the real characters were like.”A family friend, attorney Edward Tolley, told the AJC that “if she’s being portrayed as some floozy, it’s just not true.”The film is based on both a 1997 Vanity Fair article by Marie Brenner and The Suspect, a recently released book written by Kent Alexander and Kevin Salwen. Alexander was the US attorney for Georgia at the time of the bombing while Salwen was covering the event for the Wall Street Journal and they conducted over 180 interviews for their research. The pair acted as consultants for the film, drawing on their vast knowledge of what really happened.In the book, Scruggs is described as “a delightful throwback to the 1930s newspaper wars” who could be seen as rude, bombastic and wild but also authentic and hard-working. “Kathy never quietly entered a room, she exploded into it,” said Martz in the book. Scruggs was famed for her connections within both the Atlanta police department and the FBI. One of her tactics was using her sexuality to flirt with cops at a local bar after hours but rumours that she would sleep with sources were just that. Scruggs would wear short skirts and low-cut blouses in a male-dominated office but any reputation that arose as a result was based on a regressive assumption. Her drive was relentless and her track record impressive. Before the Olympics, she was in charge of a regular column that helped the FBI and other agencies “apprehend nearly one hundred alleged criminals”.After the bombing, Scruggs worked tirelessly to secure a lead, eventually finding an APD source who revealed that Jewell had become the new focus, a shift based both on inevitability (even in the film, Hamm’s fed barks that “You always look at the guy who found the bomb just like you look at the guy who found the body”) and a mounting collection of concerning yet ultimately circumstantial evidence (Jewell had found himself in hot water for impersonating a police officer in the past and lost a security job for alleged threatening behaviour while he was reportedly a user of a site that featured the notorious bomb recipe-containing Anarchist Cookbook).For “a dedicated reporter” like Scruggs, though, one source wasn’t enough and she found another who agreed to meet her in a bar after work. While he confirmed that Jewell was a suspect, he couched it by telling her she couldn’t do anything just yet as “it might ruin the investigation”. She left after 30 minutes according to the book, returning the office frustrated, refusing to name her source and worked harder to find more confirmation. The story was then deliberated over, every word carefully picked and run past the FBI’s PR representative to ensure that printing it wouldn’t hinder the investigation.I contacted Alexander and Salwen who agreed to speak to me about the book. After praising Eastwood’s film over the phone, I asked them about its portrayal of Scruggs. They froze. They didn’t realise it would be a call about Kathy. They had a statement that would be coming out later that day and agreed to speak to me after it was released.The statement refers to Scruggs as “an outstanding police reporter” who “accurately” broke the story of Jewell becoming the primary suspect. But then it continues:“Scruggs secured her Jewell scoop from a law enforcement source. We have been asked repeatedly whether we found evidence that Scruggs traded sex for the story. We did not. Though this exchange may be depicted differently in the movie, Richard Jewell, we urge everyone to see this excellent film which conveys the story of Jewell, the unsung hero, in a compelling, dramatic and entertaining manner.”It confirmed what I already knew, that the allegation wasn’t taken from their exhaustive and unparalleled research, but also that they didn’t appear to have a problem with its inclusion or at least any wish to express it. Before my second call the day after, the publicist informed me that I wouldn’t be able to ask about this scene but could talk about Kathy in general. Their statement would be the final word on that matter.On the call, they praised her as a “terrific police reporter” whose work was “extraordinarily well-sourced” and thought Wilde’s performance was “fantastic”, having met with her themselves.“I think in general, look, the film is not a documentary,” Salwen said at one point.He also referred to the importance of “accuracy” in reporting and called the behaviour of the media outlets who followed Scruggs’s “very well-checked” story “despicable”, with the film providing a much-needed reminder of journalistic unprofessionalism. I countered that I and many others have seen the film as painting Scruggs to be the only visible, despicable face of the media, villainising her in the process, something their book is at pains not to do.“I’m not sure I agree necessarily with your assessment there, I think that the movie does feature other news outlets rushing to judgment,” Salwen said.Alexander followed: “You can quibble with a scene here or there for sure but taking in broad strokes of Kathy’s life, I think she was a larger-than-life figure and the movie got that across. I spoke with my wife who thought Kathy was just great and loved her as a character in the movie.”What the film fails to add, and what the book includes in detail, is how Scruggs’s career and health were affected in the years following. Jewell filed lawsuits against many of the publications and networks who he claimed had libelled him. Even though NBC and CNN stood by their reporting, they both settled with him out of court and the New York Post followed suit.But the AJC refused to do the same, holding its ground and defending its reporting. Ultimately, in 2011, the Georgia court of appeals ruled for the paper “because the articles in their entirety were substantially true at the time they were published”. It was a long-fought victory but one that sadly, Scruggs wasn’t alive to see.Throughout the legal battle that followed her story she refused to name her source and the drawn-out proceedings took their toll on her mental and physical health. “The pressure of the lawsuit never strayed far from her psyche,” Salwen and Alexander write in their book. An injury earlier in her career had led to chronic back pain and in September 2001, after a summer of isolating herself at home, she was found unconscious. The cause of death was ruled as “acute morphine toxicity” resulting from her prescription medication.The fallout from the film, which Warners is pushing for Oscars, having secured a Golden Globe nomination for Kathy Bates as Jewell’s mother, continued just days before its 13 December release.Warners has responded to allegations of defamation by calling any lawsuit “baseless” and defending its right not to add any statement addressing the scene to the film.“It is unfortunate and the ultimate irony that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, having been a part of the rush to judgment of Richard Jewell, is now trying to malign our film-makers and cast,” the statement read. “Richard Jewell focuses on the real victim, seeks to tell his story, confirm his innocence and restore his name.”Eastwood’s response was similar. When asked this week to discuss the controversy he claimed that the AJC was “probably looking for ways to rationalise their activity” but added that he’d never discussed it with anyone from the paper.But what Warners or Eastwood or screenwriter Ray (who “reserved comment” when I asked him to talk via email and whose next project is the small-screen adaptation of James Comey’s book A Higher Loyalty) have yet to reveal is where this allegation of sexual bartering came from and why the film decides to deviate from other accounts. Warners has said that the standard disclaimer during the film’s end credits – “Dialogue and certain events and characters contained in the film were created for the purposes of dramatisation” – covers any embellishment.Wilde, whose father is a respected journalist and the current DC editor of Harper’s Magazine and whose mother is an award-winning journalist turned Democratic congresswoman, didn’t attend the AFI festival premiere for Richard Jewell and has avoided any press for the film.Earlier this month, though, she offered up a defence of her portrayal on the red carpet for the Gotham Awards. The actor, who made her directorial debut this year with the female-fronted teen comedy Booksmart, has claimed critiquing the scene in question is actually sexist in itself.“I think it’s a shame that she has been reduced to one inferred moment in the film,” Wilde said. “It’s a basic misunderstanding of feminism as pious sexlessness. It happens a lot to women we’re expected to be one-dimensional if we are to be considered feminists. There’s a complexity to Kathy, as there is to all of us, and I really admired her.”She also criticised people for condemning a project that allows “for a woman to be impure” without addressing the factual issues at hand. While Wilde hasn’t made mention of the film or controversy on Twitter, she liked a tweet that urged people to “get their priorities in line” and take Eastwood and Ray to task rather than her.At the paper, emotions are understandably still running high. Editor-in-chief Riley told me he remained concerned over the film perpetuating “a false and troubling Hollywood trope” attached to female journalists.A current reporter at the paper also shared her thoughts. “The movie version of Scruggs is crass and contemptible,” Jennifer Brett told the . “She relies on trysts with her sources for information, curses at her colleagues, breaks into someone’s car hoping for an interview and shows no empathy after the deadly bombing, praying only that the suspect will turn out to be interesting. Those who knew and worked with Scruggs bristle at that depiction, and of course she’s not here to speak for herself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37d247721d3c475c7ce4b578a8b0e5e05182c78b/42_0_2585_1552/master/2585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0165a0365570331f330276bd7a36901","title":"every michael bay film ranked","story":"Will the director’s latest effort, 6 Underground, a vigilante revenge thriller starring Ryan Reynolds, match the bombastic grandeur of the rest of his oeuvre? And which Transformers film was the least bad, anyway?You can tell that this was Michael Bay’s final Transformers film. It’s basically a compilation of every bad idea the man has ever had. There’s King Arthur. Stanley Tucci is Merlin. There’s a sexy Oxford professor called Viviane Wembley. It’s heavily implied that planet Earth was a great big Transformer all along. Everyone hated this film, even the idiots who went to see the other four.The second Transformers film is unintelligibly stupid. Visually and narratively, it is the equivalent of locking yourself in a wardrobe with a million alarm clocks and then tipping yourself down a staircase. It is a long, embarrassing, self-serious mess. Worst of all, it features two characters – called Mudflap and Skids – who are almost certainly the most offensive racial stereotypes ever to hit the silver screen in robot form.I paid money to watch The Island in a cinema 14 years ago, and I am still furious about it. Ewan McGregor is wasted as a clone trapped on – that’s right – an island. However, the real crime here is Scarlett Johansson playing a character so one-dimensionally sexualised that she may as well be an airbrushed picture of a sports car. A small contingent is starting to claim that The Island is Michael Bay’s masterpiece. It isn’t.After Dark of the Moon, Bay and Shia LaBeouf said they were done with the Transformers franchise. And yet Bay returned almost immediately with this monstrosity, dragging Mark Wahlberg into the lead. As always, this is an indecipherably bad film, the only memorable aspects of which are Wahlberg’s apparent attraction to the actor playing his daughter and the inexplicable presence of Stanley Tucci.If this was a list about any other director, then Pearl Harbor would be last. A film that heavily borrowed the “lovelorn romance against the backdrop of a real-life disaster” formula from Titanic, only to mash it beyond all recognition with a pair of dumb ham-hands, Pearl Harbor was an absolute disaster from start to finish. It is, nevertheless, one of Bay’s Top 10 films.The first Transformers film rode the wave of childhood-destroying franchise reboots, and was tonally and visually incomprehensible to boot. The robots lacked definition, the Shia LaBeouf scenes felt half-finished, the camera letched over Megan Fox to such a harrowing degree that you felt the need to hose yourself down by the time the credits kicked in. It was terrible, but it is also the second-best Transformers film.A huge disappointment after the success of Bad Boys (although not financially because it did almost double the original’s box office). Bad Boys II saw Will Smith and Martin Lawrence twisting in the wind, trying to recapture the magic of their double act through a script that is cartoonishly problematic in its depictions of gender and race. This film would never get made today, thank God.To call something the least-bad Transformers movie is to damn it with the faintest praise imaginable, but here we are. This isn’t the best film in the series because of the plot – I’ve seen it more than once and, honestly, I wouldn’t be able to tell you what happened if you put a gun to my head – but for its technical prowess. The entire film was shot on 3D cameras that had to be designed to Bay’s specifications. At least there’s that.After five Transformers films, each more stupidly large than the last, Bay wanted a change of pace. He wanted to slow things down, tell a real story and maybe win an Oscar. The result was this, a film based on a true story that nevertheless stars Jim from The Office looking like a walking human growth hormone. Had any other director tried this, it would have at least contained a modicum of intelligence. It did get nominated for an Oscar, though, for best sound mixing.Armageddon tells the story of a bunch of roughneck miners (and Ben Affleck) who are sent into space to explode an asteroid heading to Earth. This was Bay’s third feature film, but it already bore plenty of defining traces especially the editing, which appeared to have been performed by an octopus having a seizure. Roger Ebert called Armageddon the worst film of 1998. It is Michael Bay’s fourth-best film.In his first non-Transformers film for almost a decade, Bay recruited the two stars with broad enough shoulders to carry his shtick. Wahlberg and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson are perfectly cast as a pair of musclebound knuckleheads whose terrible rampage of crime and violence is, incredibly, based on a true story. It’s a horrible story played for laughs imagine Scorsese trying to make Goodfellas after having had a grade-three concussion and you are in the ballpark.Bad Boys was instrumental in helping Will Smith to world-conquering status. After dabbling in middlebrow fare such as Six Degrees of Separation and Where the Day Takes You, this is where Smith cranked up his charisma as far as it would go and watched the money roll in. It’s stylish and lightweight – a perfect first film for Bay – and it’s telling that it’s this film that Smith is returning to now his career has taken a nosee. A very belated third instalment is due next year.This isn’t just the best film that Bay has ever directed (finally, Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage together!), but perhaps the most notorious. A fake intelligence source ripped off parts of this film for a 2002 chemical weapons program dossier, meaning that The Rock is probably directly responsible for Britain’s participation in the Iraq war. Not bad for one of the stupidest movies ever made.6 Underground is released on Netflix on 13 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7359012214070a327b65ce8465bbd15d852750d1/215_0_2337_1402/master/2337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08828681437c5a7f85ada97c8715d4e5","title":"fiddler a miracle of miracles review fiddler on the roof musical documentary","story":"Surprising revelations and praise from famous fans add to the appeal of this documentary about the world-conquering Broadway musical Fiddler on the RoofDirector Max Lewkowicz’s richly detailed documentary celebrates the illustrious Broadway show Fiddler on the Roof, the evergreen shtetl-set musical first staged in 1964 with choreography and direction by Jerome Robbins and starring Zero Mostel as Teyve, the milkman.Contributions from a range of interviewees – including people attached to the original production, such as producer Hal Prince and lyricist Sheldon Harnick, and famous fans of the show, including Fran Lebowitz and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda – help to structure the history lesson about how Fiddler became a massive international hit.

They are minor politicians who are, to cite the TV show Succession, the Kendall and Shiv of this story, with waxy hatchet-faced Imelda very much the Logan Roy figure.The Marcoses’ patent mediocrity and corrupted brand identity appear to have put serious political power out of reach for them, for now. But their resurgent cynicism and corruption created the conditions for Rodrigo Duterte, the quasi-fascist strongman president who is shown contemptuously tolerating the Marcoses for what they could yet do for him.It seems at first as if this is going to be simply a black-comic portrait of entitlement, comparable to Greenfield’s 2012 film The Queen of Versailles. Actually, it is more than that: a larger, tragic picture of tyranny and corruption in the Philippines that might stand alongside Josh Oppenheimer’s The Act of Killing (2012) and The Look of Silence (2014) about the repression and slaughter in Indonesia.There are exquisitely horrible moments in this portrait when Marcos, taking us around her fabulous Manila home, and speaking in an absurdly queenly and soft-voiced way about her lifestyle and her plans for the future, unknowingly reveals how loathsome she is. Or perhaps she does know and doesn’t care, and has a shrewd sense of how her outrageousness plays well with a certain part of her (sizeable) fanbase. But it is truly stomach-turning as she gives banknotes to poor little children in the street and, on being taken to a children’s cancer hospital, Madame Marcos winces with disgust at their poverty and suffering and says to an aide: “Give me some money to give away.”Briefly, we are taken through her history: she was the former beauty queen who enjoyed a whirlwind romance with Ferdinand, the ambitious young politician. Once in power, Ferdinand was content to let Imelda go abroad to meet foreign leaders – there is an emetic shot of Mao kissing her hand. This was because he feared leaving the country in case he was toppled in a coup, and also wanted to pursue extramarital affairs. When Imelda discovered these, a certain hardness entered in her soul, making it even harder than it already was.The Marcoses took the cash intended for roads, schools etc and converted it into jewels, paintings and prime Manhattan real estate, while striking brutally at civil rights, using detention and torture. Their rival, Benigno Aquino, was imprisoned, exiled and finally murdered, and his widow, Cory, was later to take over as president herself. There are wrenchingly emotional interviews with those who were detained and tortured under the Marcos regime. A grisly symbol of the corruption is the bizarre wild animal reserve that Imelda created on Calauit Island, a vanity project that involved moving hundreds of families off the land, and whose giraffes are now not properly cared for – like everyone and everything else.For all that Marcos has to be one of the most purely objectionable figures in public life anywhere in the world, she is not a fool and occasionally reveals shrewd insights about herself. She notes how cordially she was received internationally and smirks: “Sometimes it helps that you are not taken too seriously.” Later, with regard to her blandly conceited image management, she remarks: “Perception is real, but the truth is not.”• The Kingmaker is released in the UK on 13 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abb5267e505d14d28929ba50d3595a0ce720b8c0/0_51_3078_1847/master/3078.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f3e837edcd7d8fe698dfcd8bf16247b","title":"liverpool in advanced talks to sign salzburgs takumi minamino for 725m","story":"Liverpool are in advanced talks with Red Bull Salzburg to sign the Japanese forward Takumi Minamino for a fee of £7.25m.The 24-year-old impressed Jürgen Klopp and the Liverpool players in the two meetings between the sides in the Champions League and the Premier League club are keen to take advantage of the low release clause in the player’s contract and get the deal done in January.Minamino joined Salzburg from Cerezo Osaka in 2015 and has scored 41 goals in 129 league games for the Austrian side.Liverpool qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League after the 2-0 win at Salzburg and face a hectic schedule in 2020 as they attempt to defend their European title as well as trying to win the English top-flight for the first time since 1990.

And some people were keen to share their own storiesHow often it falls to science in these darkened days to bring a much-needed glint of hope. And so to this summer’s case in point. Never mind the quest for unlimited green energy, or pollution-free air, or an elixir for life. This was a breakthrough so profound that coverage went global: at last, researchers had worked out how to stop seagulls stealing our snacks.Or at least how to deter them. In field work that was equal parts brave and foolhardy, Madeleine Goumas, a postgraduate researcher at Exeter University, ventured into the Hitchcockian danger zones that are British seaside towns. Armed with only a watch, a notepad, a pen and a bag of chips, she set about gathering data. It was not long before she had her conclusion: hungry gulls back off if you stare them out.It was not as categorical as that, of course, but let’s not trouble with details. It was a watershed moment: a small but potent sign that humans might win this war yet. Better still, that victory might come from understanding hungry animals and learning to live with them, rather than charging at them amid a salvo of profanities, or declaring, as Alan Amos, the mayor of Worcester city council did in 2017, that it’s time to “kill the bloody things”.Goumas has given the issue more serious thought. Having your food snatched from your hand while sauntering down the promenade is a problem that needs sorting, but demonising seagulls doesn’t help. Herring gulls are in decline and on the UK’s red list of Birds of Conservation Concern. “We should try and understand it from the animal’s perspective,” Goumas says now. “If you’re putting a lot of food out, of course they are going to come and try and eat it.”Her work is part of a greater effort to understand what attracts and repels seagulls. The thinking being, to bastardise the ancient Chinese general Sun Tzu, is that the better one understands the enemy, the better one is able to save one’s snacks. Goumas showed that gulls pay attention to where people are looking, in line with gulls swooping from blind spots. The information has immediate strategic value: “Put up a parasol, eat with you back to the wall, look around you,” she says.The seagull study was Goumas’s first published paper and the media attention was overwhelming. But amid the circus came a small flurry of emails from readers keen to share their own seagull stories. A woman from St Ives wrote about how she had once been housebound with a bad foot and, in the many idle moments trapped indoors, noticed a seagull nesting outside, which also sported an injured foot. She became enthralled and watched the bird for years. Much later, she spotted the limping bird again, and turned the encounter into a poem.“A lot of it is about attitude. Things are only a problem if you make them a problem,” says Goumas. “Not everyone is going to avoid having their food taken, but they can take steps to reduce their chances of it happening.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5ed6292976c84fbacd1b0328ccaad4b8a22c53e/0_367_4224_2535/master/4224.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=739c1093c1da677cd0e84d323ff314c4","title":"what can we learn from london vagina museum","story":"From 12th-century carvings to 90s coy euphemisms, women and their sexual organs have been on a journey, and a new space invites further contemplation. Like: who would wear a pussy pendant?‘There’s nothing wrong with that word: it’s not a dirty word.” Sarah Creed, curator at the Vagina Museum in Camden Market, north London, is ending a story about a gynaecologist friend whose child at nursery was told it was inappropriate to say “vagina”. Obviously I know there is nothing wrong with it. But would I wear a pussy pendant, by the Dutch artist Denise Rosenboom, which are apparently flying off the shelves? Would I have Sam Dawood’s period sculpture in my house? (I can see that this is quite a philistine criterion for appreciating art). Or a model of the vulva, identifying all the parts?A lot of myths are busted in the opening exhibition, titled Muff Busters, at this new museum: what we tend to call the vagina is actually the vulva, for example. There is only one word that describes the whole kit and it was appropriated some centuries ago as an expletive. Discharge is not effluent, it is a sign of self-cleaning. The hymen is not like a wall that you punch through. Most moderately competent feminist adults will know all this, plus, you know, Google. Which is not to say that it doesn’t need saying rather, that there is something deeper going on here than the correction of an information deficit.“I think it’s very much part of this new generation’s experience it’s very normal to talk about vaginas and vulvas,” says Creed. “It’s great that that ethos exists. I’m an 80s child: even when I was a teenager, it was completely taboo.” I am a 70s child, and likewise. However, Emma LE Rees, author of The Vagina: A Literary and Cultural History, recalls feminism’s second wave: “I’m 50, and I can remember my mum being really open and honest, to the point that I can remember bursting into tears when she told me about menstruation. Because it just sounded so horrible.”The drive to shroud the female pudenda in a mysterious disgust, to make it unsayable, is centuries old Rees was driven to write her book, which a male colleague predicted “wouldn’t get recognition, because sometimes even serious research didn’t get recognition”, by chance. She came across a Sheela na gig – carvings of naked women with exaggerated vulvas, dating back to the 12th century – on a church in Kilpeck, Herefordshire. On consulting a 19th-century guide book, she was informed that it was “‘a fool holding his chest open to show his heart’. There’s no way that’s what that figure was,” she says.Such acts of erasure are unremarkable from that century, or indeed, any other. More interesting is the pendulum swing in feminism: from the consciousness-raising days of the hand mirror and the torch, where examining your own apparatus was a political and communal act (there would have been no more purpose to doing it on your own than there would have been staging your own AA meeting) through that late-20th-century phase when sex was no longer political, because nothing was political. In theory, this was because we were post-postmodern our biology needed not be our destiny and therefore to go on a journey of awakening through your vulva would have been particularly droll. In practice, that meant vulvas going back in the closet. Today, the full beam of attention has returned and to know yourself anatomically is, again, political. It has become the gateway body part to other conversations. Some of them - period poverty, for instance – are timeless, but reanimated. Others – sex work, trans rights – go to the heart of what ides feminism today.That is not to say that feminism was not ided in the 60s it is just that, in the absence of social media, nobody noticed. In the broadcast journalist Emma Barnett’s book Period: It’s About Bloody Time, she pieces together feminism’s relationship with the body. Barnett was, of course, concentrating on periods, rather than the more generic place-periods-come-out-of, but the principles were the same. That early radicalism – Germaine Greer telling women to taste their own periods – was not elaborated by the movement, because there was an equal and opposite force within the same generation of women: the equality wing of feminism.“What they were doing was trying to get us into the workplace,” says Barnett. So, she says, anatomy was “the last thing you’re going to bring up”. This is one of those obvious-sounding remarks that sets off a lightbulb in your head when I think of that generation, who were at the vanguard of the fight for professional equality, in both wages and opportunity, it is striking how hard-boiled they so often seemed about all aspects of the female experience. Miscarriage? Suck it up, happens to everyone. Childbirth? Back to work in 17 days. Period pain was for wimps a vulva was like a PowerPoint display, you should only bring it up if you’re going to use it in the next five minutes. I am not just beefing with my mother, by the way. This was all of them. I’m joking. (I’m not joking).So the gender-equality movement, whose wellspring was radical emancipation, did a handbrake turn back to pubic taboo when it had to make a choice between being accepted in the workplace now and enjoying a brighter, more open, more accepting tomorrow. It felt as though nobody really mentioned women’s bits seriously again until menstrual activism took off in the mid-00s, with avant-garde writers such as Chella Quint documenting a decade of periods, and the likes of artist Ingrid Berthon-Moine, who created a series of portraits of women using their menstrual blood as lipstick.What had happened in the interim was the post-postmodern 90s, when a lot of energy was concentrated on overcoming taboos around promiscuity. But there was a contradiction at the core of this: sex itself was a feminist act, especially if it was indiscriminate yet at the same time, we were extremely closed about female sexual organs, right down to what you called anything, or what anything looked like. “I loathe euphemisms,” Rees says. “Hoo hoos, vajayjays, lady gardens. But I don’t think the word ‘cunt’ can be reclaimed, either.” I agree, but I am interested: I don’t remember any adults using those coy synonyms before the 1990s and the swear word used to be 10 times ruder, friendship-endingly extreme.But tense silences never last for ever. Even without social media and selfie-awareness – the sense that self-acceptance is integral to one’s brand – we would inevitably have reached something beyond complete vulva omerta. Feminism has been on a whistlestop journey from ignoring the vulva to organising around it, and campaigns to end period poverty – often, like the climate strikes, starting at schools, although some, such as FlowAid, focused on awful deprivations endured by homeless women - make sense, even while I find them depressing. (It is such a failure of political empathy, that we would need such a graphic illustration of what poverty actually means before we can talk about it but that’s 2019, it’s nobody’s vagina’s fault). Contemporaneously, though, other fissures opened up, notably that of trans rights, in which there are certainly people on both sides who would have you believe that talking about anyone’s anatomy, in any context at all, is an insult verboten.Creed is comfortable on the territory: “We’re a trans ally, we’re an intersex ally. We’re LGBTQ+ positive. It’s not just women who menstruate,” she says. “Not everybody who has a vagina is a woman.” Her framing is different and it takes me a second to realise why: the current debate is fixated on, mired in even, what you need, physically, to qualify as a woman. Creed flips the perspective to “just because you have a vagina doesn’t mean you have to be a woman”, which lets in the experience of trans men (who, to my knowledge, are pretty much obliterated in the current debate, which is all about women-only spaces and, by inference, intrinsic male violence). This makes the question: “What do you need, biologically, to be who you are?” more complicated and thereby less heated.There has been a subtler attitude change to the vulva within some parts of feminism, which Creed explains, in precis. “Originally, there was a sense of reclamation: ‘This is mine, and it’s nobody else’s.’ But now, it’s more like: ‘This is mine, and also, I want to share it with you all.’ Not literally.”There is no reason that this should force the issue of sex work – still considered the pinnacle of male oppression in some quarters but an issue of solidarity for others – but it is unsurprising to me that Creed should bring it up. “Sex work historically was seen as for the pleasure of a man,” she says. “It’s difficult when you start there to build in a woman’s perspective.” It’s a judgment call, of course: you could perfectly easily create a vagina museum and still be anti-sex work. But once you reject the notion of the vagina as a mysterious space, you can no longer make the assumption that it is a site of oppression irrespective of whether or not the owner realises it in other words, there is no reason not to listen to sex workers.There is one thing about the vulva that has not changed, where the Vagina Museum explicitly sets out to move things on. Women still feel crap about themselves. “One thing that we look at is labiaplasty,” says Creed. “Between 2002 and 2012, it went up by 500 percent on the NHS.” One of the gynaecologists (and there have been a few) who has supported the museum said she had been working in this area for 20 years, had seen hundreds of labias in her time, and only one that was genuinely anatomically abnormal. So it is really mental distress people are just so upset with how they look. “Your vulva is like your face,” she continues. “There isn’t one look to go for. There is no ideal. But how can anyone know they’re not an outlier, if they’ve only seen their own?”Yet alongside all that self-hate, there is a playfulness that, I think, can not be explained by changing politics alone, or even at all the pussy pendants are flying off the shelves. “Who would wear a decorative vulva round their neck?” the third wave asks. “Who wouldn’t?” the fourth wave replies. All the merch and paraphernalia has this ludic, carefree subtext that the intensity of the 60s and 70s, and the squeamishness that came after it, could never have set out to achieve. You cannot strategise your way to self-acceptance or maybe they did and it just took a long time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f76ae8407481aa68670ede95f1393561d1656535/1382_982_2655_1593/master/2655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d3facf5c4c69f5a21e4406456f5be18","title":"bbc denies political editors postal vote comments broke law","story":"Broadcaster’s political editor said on air that ballots in so far were looking ‘grim’ for LabourThe BBC has said its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, did not break electoral law when she reported claims that postal ballots painted a “grim” picture for Labour.Kuenssberg told viewers on Wednesday that while parties were not supposed to look at voting papers when they were verified – but not counted – at opening sessions, they did “get a hint” of how they were doing and it was not looking good for Labour.She said: “The forecast is that it’s going to be wet and cold tomorrow. The postal votes, of course, have already arrived. The parties – they’re not meant to look at it, but they do kind of get a hint – and on both sides people are telling me that the postal votes that are in are looking pretty grim for Labour in a lot of parts of the country.“Of course, postal voters tend to skew to elderly voters and people who vote early … but the kind of younger generation who we know skew much more to the Labour party, you might expect to turn out to the polls tomorrow. But in this winter election, turnout is just another one of these factors that we just can’t predict.”Video of her remarks, made during an interview on the BBC’s Politics Live programme, was widely shared on social media on the final day of an election campaign that has seen unprecedented criticism of the media. It led to suggestions that she could potentially have breached the Representation of the People Act, which prevents the reporting of how people voted until after polls close.A spokesperson for the broadcaster made clear they did not believe there were any issues with the on-air comments. “The BBC does not believe it, or its political editor, has breached electoral law,” they said.Party candidates and agents can observe postal votes being verified before polling day but the ballot papers are placed face down and are not counted until polls close on election day.In reality, political parties regularly use the verification process as an opportunity to try to ine information on how they are performing in constituencies and adjust tactics in the final days of the campaign. This week BuzzFeed News reported claims that a northern Labour official had told colleagues that “postal votes in all Labour seats are bad” and ordered activists to stay in so-called defensive seats already held by the party. In 2010 the Labour MP Kerry McCarthy infamously tweeted the result of the postal votes in her Bristol East constituency, for which she received a caution from the police.The Electoral Commission issued a statement on Wednesday warning against revealing results. “It may be an offence to communicate any information obtained at postal vote opening sessions, including about votes cast, before a poll has closed. Anyone with information to suggest this has happened should report it immediately to the police,” it said. has learned that Waltham Forest council in east London has been scrambling to deliver postal votes that should have been out by last Friday, after an administrative error delayed the process.The problem affected 1,470 voters in three constituencies, including Chingford and Woodford Green, which Iain Duncan Smith won for the Conservatives with a majority of 2,438 at the last election and which is a key target for Labour.The council could not say how many voters were affected in each constituency but said all but one form had now been delivered.It said 1,364 forms had been hand-delivered by the end of Monday and 105 more had been couriered to voters outside London on Tuesday and Wednesday.A council spokesman said the borough had dealt with 27,993 postal votes for this election. He apologised for the error and said the Electoral Commission had been notified.He added: “Completed postal votes will get to us if they are posted by last post on Wednesday 11 December. They can also be handed to staff at any polling station in the constituency on the day of the general election.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5c914ef1d269ab9726a01209e88ce2702c285d9/0_148_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23d123a9f3cd36a3498b54bf10a018e2","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2020 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us coverAs 2019 comes to a close, we want to reflect on our journalism and look ahead to next year’s stories.

That would be the worst election result for the party since 1983, making it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to hang on as leader – while Johnson would have a free rein to complete Brexit at the third time of asking by 31 January.This is roughly the closest to the prevailing polling, in line with YouGov’s Tuesday prediction of a majority of 28. The Conservatives would end up with 340 seats (up 23) and Labour on 237, slightly ahead of its disappointing 2015 result, but 25 seats down on last time.Signs this is happening would be if the Conservatives gain Lincoln (Lab maj 1,538), Derby North (Lab maj 2,015), Wakefield (Lab maj 2,176) Wrexham (Lab maj 1,832), but not the seats with larger majorities mentioned in the section above.The Conservatives could afford to lose two seats in Scotland to the SNP (Stirling and Gordon) and one in London (Chipping Barnet), but would still have a good enough result to allow Boris Johnson to look forward to five years in Downing Street.After a successful pre-election purge of rebel Conservative MPs, even a majority of 10 or more could easily be sufficient for governing, particularly in completing the first phase of the UK’s exit from the EU.This familiar scenario kicks in if the Conservatives miss the 326 overall majority figure by a few seats. Boris Johnson could try for a minority government if the Conservatives end up in the low 320s, but anything in the high 310s would leave him theoretically reliant on the DUP, already unhappy with the renegotiated Brexit deal.The prime minister would remain in post while he tried to form a government, while it would be for the combined opposition parties to come up with an alternative and, if necessary, defeat him in a motion of no confidence sometime before Christmas.On this scenario, the Conservatives end up even, probably meaning that gains made in the northern half of England and all of Wales, are offset by losses elsewhere. The Tories do take seats such as Barrow and Furness (Lab maj 209) and Peterborough (Lab maj 607 at the last general election), but not Ipswich (Lab maj 831) or Stockton South (Lab maj 888) on Teesside.Labour, meanwhile, makes more gains in the south-east, taking Southampton Itchen (Con maj 31) and Hastings and Rye (Con maj 346), only loses four seats in Scotland and hangs on in Canterbury (Lab maj 187) and Stroud (Lab maj 687). Overall the party is still down, at 253 seats, but remains competitive.To complete the picture SNP gains four from the Tories, the last of which is Ochil and South Perthshire (Con maj 3,359), and the Lib Dems pick up Richmond Park (Con maj 45) in London. In Northern Ireland, gains by the SDLP in Belfast South and Foyle and by the Alliance party in North Down help with the arithmetic.It depends a little on the wider results picture, but if the Conservatives fall below the low 310s Boris Johnson could not form a government just with the DUP. The prime minister might try to talk to the SNP and the Lib Dems but the initiative would move to the opposition to see if it could form a government led by Corbyn.It is possible for Labour to lead a coalition if the party ends up with the same number of seats it has now, on 262. The party wins Norwich North (Con maj 507), gains Northampton North (Con maj 807) and Milton Keynes South (Con maj 1,725), offsetting any seat losses elsewhere.Winning Putney (Con maj 1,554) and Watford (Con maj 2,092) would be particularly helpful, as would restricting any losses to the Conservatives to a couple of seats in the north of England.The SNP also gains Angus (Con maj 2,645), the Lib Dems St Albans (Con maj 6,109) and there is a surprise win for an independent in East Devon. Beyond that there is limited headroom for the SNP, but if the Lib Dems can really pull off wins in Winchester (Con maj 9,999), or even Esher and Walton (Con maj 23,298), then the Tories are in trouble, and Boris Johnson out of a job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d8842509630b8e30b965ae80e6c5b1a3c5017a5/0_209_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e96a8ed0270c6b67b16d49f09119769","title":"have you experienced any voting issues share your stories","story":"We’d like to hear about any voting issues at polling stations or with postal votes and any other news tips that you think we should know about If you have experienced any problems with your postal vote or at the polling station, we’d like to hear from you.

His stepdad owns rental properties “and Labour wants to take those houses off him and give them to poor people, which doesn’t seem fair because he has been trying to pay off these houses his whole life”, he said. Furlong, who hopes to do a railway apprenticeship and become a train driver, said his future children would be lumbered with the debts racked up by Labour’s spending pledges.Asked for her opinion on Jeremy Corbyn, Martyna Laskowska, who was born in Poland, said he was an “extremist – a neo-Marxist. He tries to make everything equal but not everything can be equal, like healthcare or education.”David Hepworth was conflicted. “I like what Labour is trying to do with tuition fees. However, I don’t like Jeremy Corbyn and I don’t like Boris Johnson. And I don’t like how Labour spends money it doesn’t have.”Only a few of the students ever read a newspaper or news website, getting their news instead from Facebook or Twitter. They were all sceptical of everything they read. “I don’t think any sources are reliable,” said Hepworth. Samantha Knowles said she thought social media was going to be “the biggest influencer” in the election among young people: YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, “even on Snapchat”. She said she saw more negative things than positive things about Corbyn on her feeds.At Marple sixth form college in Stockport, two-thirds of students intended to vote Labour and the others were set on the Conservatives.Lucy Reid said she was voting Tory because she thought the result of the EU referendum should be honoured “even though I would have rather remained, because that’s what democracy is”.She disagreed with Labour’s plans to increase tax for those who earn more than £80,000: “My dad earns just £80,000, my mum earns just £15,000. That might sound like a lot of money compared to some people but I wouldn’t ever call myself middle class because my dad is a manual worker, he’s a scaffolder. He’s just lucky he’s been in his firm for so long they constantly raise his pay because he’s a loyal worker, whereas my mum works in a supermarket. Both of them have worked so hard to get where they are, but why should my dad be taxed more money just because he earns a little bit more than everybody else? That then affects me,” she said.Hannah Yates, a passionate Labour voter in High Peak, said her dad also earned enough to be taxed more: “My dad doesn’t mind being taxed that little more if it can go to the NHS or universities – it’s not like it’s being taken and thrown to the wind … For the working-class people who have to work three jobs to make ends meet, they need all the help they can get.”Taylor Marsden said Corbyn was “the first politician I can actually believe in. If it wasn’t for him, I probably wouldn’t vote … My mum works in the NHS and she tells me people are constantly leaving. I remember reading something about nurses using food banks so I support Labour’s policy of paying nurses more … I just think Labour’s policies are generally geared towards reducing inequality, whereas Conservatives just suit themselves.”But Dapo Gabriel Onibudo said he was breaking family tradition by voting Conservative. “Jeremy Corbyn is the main reason I am not voting Labour,” he said.Many in the class argued that the prime minister was a racist. “Boris Johnson said the most disgusting things about minorities and no one seems to be talking about it at all,” said Yates. “People are always going on about how antisemitic Labour is, when the leader of the Conservative party can be racist against black people, homophobic about gay men and say sexist things about women and have absolutely no punishment at all … he referred to black people having ‘watermelon smiles’ and referred to gay people as ‘croptop-wearing bumboys’.”All but one of the upper sixth formers the  spoke to at Waldegrave school in Richmond-upon-Thames said they planned to vote Liberal Democrat, many for tactical reasons. The sole dissenter was Isabel Atkins, who will vote Labour for “the redistribution of wealth”, despite assessing the party’s chances in Twickenham as “close to none”. Her parents have not forgiven the Lib Dems for breaking their promise not to increase tuition fees while in coalition with the Conservatives: “I’ve got four older brothers and they have all gone to university.”But for the rest of the class, tuition fees were not a key issue. They were more motivated to try to stop the Conservatives winning. Some, like Sylvie Sizeland, wanted to support Labour but said there was no point in Richmond: “It would be a wasted vote.” She was going to vote tactically to try to oust Goldsmith, “because in the mayoral campaign against Sadiq Khan he made some really racist remarks about Khan”.Ami Thakrar said she liked many Labour policies but found them “far-fetched – like the idea of giving free broadband to everyone”. Benjamin Baker described Johnson as “exceptionally unreliable and not trustworthy for thousands of reasons. You’ve got the however many millions of pounds for the NHS on the bus he supported, you’ve got him saying he would never go back to Brussels, he’d rather die in a ditch, and yet here he is very much alive and kicking.”Meanwhile at Only Connect, a service helping young people and ex-offenders through music in King’s Cross, north London, Labour is drawing most of the young voters. Tèsharn Dundas, 19, said Stormzy was heavily influencing the youth vote after the grime artist signed a letter alongside other musicians backing the Labour leader.“During this election I have seen lots of tweets with people saying they are voting Corbyn because of Stormzy,” Dundas said. He added that Corbyn was also appealing because of his policy on scrapping tuition fees and free broadband plan. “He is taking away university fees, and offering free wifi, so yes I think I will vote for him … He is more down to earth too.Like Dundas, she thinks Stormzy could help sway a lot of young people. “If Stormzy is behind them, they will probably win,” she said.“I don’t like the Conservatives at all. I don’t connect with them … I don’t think they are for young people or the working people. I think it is hard for them right now to steer the country in the right direction.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be347a5b6a21e4a19bb276485b8e6f9c9a069f35/0_307_2996_1798/master/2996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6331409d2be6facf67186c70e36f0307","title":"polls open in most important general election in a generation","story":"Early turnout appears strong as queues reported at some polling stationsLong queues have been reported outside a number of UK polling stations as initial turnout in the general election appeared strong following a closely fought campaign billed by both main parties as the “most important in a generation”.Voters in some London constituencies tweeted photos of lines of voters, with some saying they had not previously faced such a long wait to make their choice. Similar scenes were reported elsewhere, including in Cambridge and Manchester.Boris Johnson was the first of the main party leaders to cast his vote, arriving at Methodist Central Hall in Westminster with his dog, Dilyn, at about 8.15am to make his choice in the UK’s third general election in less than five years.Prime ministers usually vote for themselves in the constituency they represent, but Johnson opted to cast his vote in the seat containing Downing Street rather than in his own Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency in west London.Jeremy Corbyn cast his vote later in his north London constituency. He was greeted by a small number of supporters as well as a protester dressed as the Sesame Street character Elmo, who was restrained by security guards as she tried to approach the Labour leader.Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, cast her vote at a primary school in Bearsden in her constituency of East Dunbartonshire. The Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, voted at Broomhouse Park Community Hall in Glasgow. The initial queues will prompt speculation about a big turnout after a six-week campaign dominated by Brexit, the NHS, claims of bias and accusations that the prime minister was ducking media scrutiny.Emily Waterhouse, a solicitor, said she waited an hour to vote in the east London constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow, and when she left at 9.15am there were about 150 people in the queue.There have been trials of voter ID in local elections and the Conservatives have stated that they want to bring in some form of UK-wide ID requirement for voting in the future, but for this election there is no change to the current system.You do not need to show ID to vote in England, Scotland and Wales in a general election. You don’t even need to bring your polling card. You just need to tell polling staff your name and address. They will then cross your name off the list and give you a ballot paper.If you’re voting in Northern Ireland,\u0026nbspyou must show photo ID.Only the following forms of ID will be accepted at polling stations in Northern Ireland:Your photographic identification does not need to be current, so even if it is out of date you can still use it to vote. The presiding officer will have the final say over whether or not the photograph matches that of the person intending to vote.\u0026nbspFind out more about voting in Northern Ireland.Alixe Bovey, a voter in Streatham, south-east London, tweeted that she had queued for 35 minutes. “In 20 years of voting in Streatham Hill, always at about this time of day, I have never encountered a queue of more than six or seven people,” she said.Voters in two London seats reported similar experiences. “I’ve voted at the same station and time for eight years, but have never had to queue before,” Craig Fordham, 45, from Putney, told PA Media. He said he had to wait for 15 minutes.Long queues were reported in Manchester Central, a usually safe Labour seat being defended by Lucy Powell. And Twitter users posted pictures of long lines in Cambridge, where Labour’s Daniel Zeichner is defending a 12,661 majority. The Electoral Commission has advised that polling stations can become particularly busy towards the end of the day. However, voters in a queue at a polling station before the closing time of 10pm will be entitled to a ballot paper. As soon as voting closes at 10pm, the results of exit polls carried out by Ipsos Mori for BBC News, ITV News and Sky News will be announced.The exit poll is derived from voters at 144 stations being asked to fill in a mock ballot paper as they leave, disclosing how they have voted.In the last general election, in 2017, the exit poll correctly predicted a hung parliament, while in 2015 it was more accurate than the opinion polls during the campaign but did not predict the Conservative majority that emerged.The first official results are announced about an hour after the close of the polls. Out of 650 UK constituencies, Houghton and Sunderland South holds the record for being the quickest to return a result after declaring at 10.48pm in 2015.The rest of the results are declared throughout the night. The majority of counts will be completed by 6am on Friday. If a party wins in 326 constituencies, it will have gained a majority."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cd252e45802568f4022d3192d0e1221125cca8d/1207_440_3347_2009/master/3347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df391bc0fd9e272e9e675f4bda8969ee","title":"uk no longer makes running on world stage says ex no 10 adviser","story":"John Casson blames absence of strategic thinking about UK role in worldBritain has not made the running on any foreign policy issue since at least 2013 and suffers from a fundamental absence of strategic thinking about its role in the world, the most senior foreign policy adviser to David Cameron has said.John Casson – who worked in No 10 from 2010 to 2014 before becoming UK ambassador to Cairo until last year – warned of a lack of confidence across Whitehall about Britain’s role in the world. “We see lots of actors smaller than us by most metrics making more of a difference because they have a clearer-eyed sense of their strategic intent and the power they hold,” he said.Speaking at a debate on future British foreign policy at Chatham House, he also lamented that no British prime minister since either Tony Blair or Gordon Brown had thought it worthwhile to invest in personal relations with foreign leaders, adding this judgment had cost Britain dear.Casson criticised Boris Johnson, describing the prime minister’s strategy as haphazard. He said: “Boris Johnson makes speeches about the cult of the strongman and wanting to stand up to human rights abusers in certain situations, but then in other situations pops up making contradictory signals to that.”Without naming him, he also delivered a scathing assessment of a recent foreign secretary’s ability to think strategically. Casson recounted: “I once got stuck in traffic in the back of a car with one of the most recent foreign secretaries and I said: ‘Given all of us in the Foreign Office spend our time trying to make sure you don’t do anything different from what we normally do, what is it the thing that you think you are trying to get us to do to leave behind as your legacy?’“This person thought about it for a bit and said: ‘Well, I really think we should be trying to save the African elephant and leading on the international wildlife trade, and it is really important that we bring girls into school worldwide and I suppose one of these conflicts in the world, we should be taking a lead on solving.” We then had a discussion about whether Palestine, Libya, Syria or Yemen was particularly ripe for British intervention.”Johnson repeatedly as foreign secretary highlighted the future of elephants, using one speech at Chatham House to admit he was “obsessed with the tragic fate of the African elephant”. He also said more girls in education was the key to unlocking some of the world’s greatest problems.Casson added: “I say this by way of saying there has been an absence of any depth of strategic thinking not just at political level but also confidence amongst officials not just in the Foreign Office but across Whitehall to think clearly about what is the nature of the power that we hold.“The bald fact for me is British foreign policy – as I was brought up to recognise it – came to an end in September 2013, when David Cameron made a conscious decision to stop being an activist prime minister on foreign policy after he lost the Syrian vote in the Commons. Since then it is very difficult to name an issue on which Britain has made the running in the international space.”He insisted this was not a lament for liberal interventionism, but instead a breakdown in a pro-active optimistic foreign policy drawing on Britain’s strengths.As a former foreign affairs private secretary to Cameron, he added a prime minister “needs to be on the telephone a lot and travel a lot and see a big part of their job as having relationships with foreign leaders for the sake of relationships with foreign leaders. Since Tony Blair, and perhaps Gordon Brown, we have not really had a prime minister that has had the capacity and the appetite to see as a fundamental slice of their job investing in those political relationships. It has cost us in terms of foreign policy outcomes.”He said from his own experience at No 10 that it is “a bloody battle” to get the prime minister to focus on foreign leaders since “the building is full of people who think it is a waste of time because it does not win you elections”.He attributed the decline in UK foreign policy influence to a range of factors including the absence of the US holding the ring for its allies, the distraction of Brexit, the shift to a multi-polar world, but also the absence of any confidence in the British political system about what the UK can offer to help the shape the world.The critical factor in shaping British future power would be Brexit, he said, saying the world would be watching and smelling for the signs of economic success or failure. “If the rest of the world think we are in a mess, the rest of our foreign policy will be very difficult to conduct.”He added that Britain had confused its international brand. “Are we an open country that aspires to set an example and stand up for certain type of norms and influence?” He said this showed in the country’s policies on visas, foreign investment and universities. “It is not just about foreign policy statements. We need to find our way back to a clearer narrative of what is our point of attraction.”He also urged Britain to be ruthless about aligning its future leverage after Brexit, saying it needed to think whether it wished to remain close to Europe, become the best friend of the newly emerging nations or instead maintain as long as possible the transatlantic umbrella. He said the few bureaucratic changes under way in Whitehall to prepare for Brexit did not match the scale of the challenge facing the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83c634dcef354dbc023f3031d596ed57f63195d7/485_818_2148_1289/master/2148.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d894c505da85a2d6758650eb58718309","title":"whats happening where you are on polling day","story":"Help us document what’s happening around Britain on polling day by sharing your stories, photos and videosAs you go out to vote today we want you to show us what’s happening on the ground.This is the place to share your stories from wherever you are on polling day in words, pictures or video.

Follow the latest developments – liveCardiff University has suffered an error with its online voting registration system, leaving up to 180 of its students ineligible to cast their votes, writes Will Neal. The university says it is difficult to give an exact figure, but the issue has reportedly affected all students who registered to vote in November. The university initially gave its students a deadline of the end of October to register via its own internal system. When the deadline passed, all applications that had been submitted were sent to the local council. Due to an administrative oversight, the portal was then left online throughout November even though applications were no longer been passed on. As a result, a number of students who accessed the portal after the October deadline were not registered to vote. The city council has said it is too late for them to be included on the list of voters for the area as the legal deadline for registration has passed. It comes after Cardiff received up to a thousand invalid applications ahead of today’s elections, due to problems with inputting addresses. Efforts were successfully made to contact those affected, but at least 200 people were not registered in time.  A spokesperson for the university said: “We are deeply sorry and apologise, unreservedly. We have contacted all students we believe are affected. As soon as the issue was brought to our attention, we did everything possible to put it right.” “We undertake a full review of our processes to ensure this can never happen again,” he added. In Brussels, all the 28 EU heads of state and government, except Boris Johnson, are gathering for a two-day summit.Johnson is being represented by Donald Tusk’s replacement as European council president, Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium.As Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, arrived at the Europa building, where leaders are meeting, he was asked what advice he would give the newly elected prime minister of the UK, whoever he may be. “To get a majority in the House of Commons and to be able to fulfil the agreements we decided on both sides,” Bettel told reporters. “To have a parliament in London that agrees on the future relationship and all these things very quickly.”Bettel’s comments reflect the widely held view among the leaders that a Johnson majority and an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU on 31 January would now be the least worst outcome.Charles Michel, the new president of the European council, has told reporters at a two-day EU leaders’ summit in Brussels that the EU will comment on the general election once the results are in.He said: “I show always respect for the choices made by the voters and we will wait and see what will be the outcome of these elections.”Should Boris Johnson secure a working majority, the EU27 are expected to issue a summit communique on Friday announcing their intention to move swiftly on to negotiations about the future relationship with the UK.The Conservatives in Southport, Merseyside, have been accused of attaching an election posters to a lamppost outside a polling station in the constituency.Reader Dominic Porteous sent in this picture of the offending poster.The south west London borough of Merton says it is taking “urgent action” to remove election posters near polling stations. PoliMonitor, supported by a grant from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, analysed 139,564 tweets referencing the 2,503 candidates on the social networking site published on Monday 11 November 2019 referencing.. It found that 23,039 were abusive. Other findings of the PoliMonitor research were: Concerns were raised before the election at the number of MPs - particularly women – standing down with many citing abuse, including cabinet minister Nicky Morgan and Heidi Allen, the former Conservative MP who defected to the Liberal Democrats via Change UK. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott who was found by a previous study to be subject to nearly half the abusive tweets sent to female MP, was sixth in the PoliMonitor list of politicians receiving the most abuse, behind Michael Gove (Conservatives) and Caroline Lucas (Green party).Sam Cunningham, CEO of PoliMonitor, said:While most candidates received little or no abuse, the most prominent candidates received thousands of abusive messages, deterring politicians from having constructive conversations about policies which matter. For some, this abuse is deterring them from taking part in politics altogether. More positively, the most extremely abusive terms were absent in the data analysed, suggesting social media companies and the public are getting better at stamping out the most abhorrent and unacceptable language.Brexit has upended Northern Ireland politics but election day here has boiled down to a traditional, familiar contest between Orange and Green.Of 18 constituencies the most closely watched and bitterly fought is North Belfast, where the DUP’s Nigel Dodds risks defenestration by Sinn Féin’s rising star John Finucane. Both men voted this morning amid grey rain that matches voters’ dour mood.Remainers – a majority here – say Brexit has been foisted on them. Leavers, who tend to be unionist, call Boris Johnson’s deal a betrayal that will weaken Northern Ireland’s position in the UK.Existential stakes, yet Northern Ireland’s MPs may be little more than spectators when the region’s fate is decided. A hung parliament is the only chance either side has of exerting influence at Westminster.Sinn Féin and the DUP have thrown everything they have at North Belfast, a toxic battle of smears, dirty tricks, tribal appeals and Troubles-era rhetoric.Defeat for Dodds, its deputy leader and Brexit architect, would hit DUP morale and confidence. But the party may return to Westminster with an additional MP courtesy of North Down, where it is favoured to win the seat vacated by by independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon.Sinn Féin’s nightmare scenario is for Finucane to falter in North Belfast and for Elisha McCallion to lose her Derry seat to Colum Eastwood, leader of the SDLP.The party of John Hume hopes to clinch a Lazarus-like revival by take an additional seat in South Belfast where Claire Hanna, thanks in part to Sinn Féin and other pro-remain parties standing aside, is tipped to oust the DUP’s Emma Little-Pengelly.Naomi Long, leader of the non-aligned Alliance party, has an uphill battle against Gavin Robinson, the DUP’s incumbent in East Belfast.Whatever the results, there is hope the DUP and Sinn Féin will in coming weeks negotiate their way back to Stormont, the seat of the assembly that collapsed in acrimony three years ago, zombifying Northern Ireland politics.Some cautious optimism, too, in the Republic where a thinkthank report says there could be an economic bounce if Johnson wins a majority and pushes through his Brexit deal.Police in Nottingham helped an older voter to a polling station after responding to a report of an 80-year-old suffering from the cold and struggling to walk.“It transpired he’d overexerted himself walking to his local station to cast his vote,” according to the police operation response team. He was also got a cup of hot coffee to “warm him up”. There is no sign now of the pre-work polling queues reported earlier in the Tory marginal of Putney. This image was taken just after dawn.Jack Shenker writes for the  that this election pitches the interests of rentiers against renters.He says that the Conservatives are intent on preserving the status quo, while Labour believe things cannot stay as they are.As things stand, the beneficiaries of that status quo are those who control, trade and live off existing assets and are thus liberated from dependence on the productive economy – including hedge funds, private equity firms and other purveyors of footloose, financialised capital, but also those who own their own homes outright or earn an income from pension funds, as well as actual landlords. The far bigger group that is losing out encompasses not only private tenants, but everyone reliant on wages and public spending for survival, not to mention all those who would prefer not to see the planet burn.There are, of course, a great many older people in the first category who, seeking an insurance policy against the spiralling costs of social care, are understandably protective of their assets and wary of radical change. Labour’s challenge is to convince them that efforts to rebalance the economy will improve rather than diminish their lives in the years to come, and that curbing the domination of market logic – in housing, as well as many other areas of society – will bring immense benefits to their children, grandchildren and the wider community as well.A long queue of students voting has been reported at one of the University of Exeter’s Cornish campus in the relatively marginal constituency Falmouth and Truro. The Conservatives are defending a majority of 3,792 over Labour in the seat.Meanwhile, turnout appears to continue to be high at the University of Kent in the Labour marginal of Canterbury.Lots of people have contacted the  to tell us that they have had issues with postal votes.Fraser Robinson and his wife are registered to vote in Ceredigion, Wales, and had applied for a postal ballot from the Netherlands. The documents never came through. He said: We made sure we were registered and were confirmed but ballots never arrived. The council electoral services officer I spoke to confessed that she was ‘tired of hearing from people overseas that they hadn’t received ballots’ and that she heard the same complaints during the EU election.  The council has put the blame at the feet of Royal Mail, Royal Mail has blamed the council and the Electoral Commission has told me it is not their concern. Their casual approach to this problem has been really hard to stomach. If it was just my ballot lost in the post it would be one thing, but my wife’s as well as other complaints from Ceredigion postal voters makes me wonder if any of them were actually dispatched.Maggie, who works on an administrative team in Poole, said that because her postal vote hadn’t arrived she’d had to take time off work to make sure she could vote in her constituency of Mid Dorset and North Poole. She said:I got in touch with the electoral office in Dorchester in Dorset who told me that they would reissue the postal pack but if that doesn’t arrive this morning, I’m going to have to drive from where I live in Wimborne to Dorchester (23 miles) to collect the documentation that will allow me to vote in person at home. I’ve had to take a half-day off work and obviously pay for the petrol – but I think it’s very important to vote in my constituency today. This is a particularly important election and it’s possible my vote could make a difference where I live. James Aufenast lives in north London but was supposed to be submitting a proxy postal vote to Bath and North East Somerset on behalf of his sister Julia, who lives in Hong Kong. He said:My sister is really concerned about what is happening in the UK right now despite having her own problems in Hong Kong. She was keen for me to vote for her by proxy (postal vote) and we organised well ahead of time. However, Bath and NE Somerset Council failed to send out the voting forms in time. In a marginal constituency where every vote counts, she feels she has been deprived of her democratic right at a crucial time.  I feel culpable too as it was up to me to organise and I have let her down. Obviously the responsibility lies with Bath, but I think the reason I am so upset is because it feels like a huge amount is riding on this election.  Aufenast said that when he contacted the local council to chase the issue up, they told him he was not the first person to have called in.  The council said in a response to his query: We have received a lot of calls from electors that have not received poll cards and postal votes. It’s a combination of a national election and the Christmas post that have created a Royal Mail fiasco.Party activists in Haddington, a large market town in the Scottish National party target seat of East Lothian, report unusually high levels of voting this morning – something put down to voters eager to avoid going out after dark and very high levels of interest in this election. Lorraine Glass, a veteran SNP election campaigner standing outside the Aubigny sports centre, said turnout had “really quite good”, despite the chilly December weather. It’s busier for this time of day than it would normally be. I think people are much more engaged than they were in 2017. People have been really polite on the doorsteps. They say they’re fed up with Brexit but they’re wanting to talk to you about it.Sandra Gaughan, a Labour campaigner, said people wanted to vote during daylight hours.It gets dark at 4.30pm. It has been really, really constant.I was here at 7.30am with my daughter before she went to work, and she had to queue. There were people queueing here at 7 o’clock there was some woman who was quite bureaucratic saying: ‘Tell me which street you live on and I will tell you which booth to go to.’ East Lothian is being keenly contested by the SNP’s candidate, Kenny MacAskill, a veteran SNP figure most famous for freeing from prison the man accused of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, when he was Scottish justice secretary.Good afternoon, this is Haroon Siddique, taking over the blog for a bit to give Matthew a break. I’ll then be back to take you through from 3pm to 8pm.Another place where queues have been reported is University of Lincoln. Lincoln is expected to be one of the tightest contests. The Conservatives’ Karl McCartney is trying to win back the seat he lost by just 1,538 votes to Labour’s Karen Lee in 2017. McCartney, who ousted Labour in 2010, won by just 1,443 votes in 2015.A 48-year-old man has been arrested after a suspicious device was found near a polling station in North Lanarkshire (see earlier).Police said the device was discovered on the ground floor of Glen Tower flats in Motherwell at around 1am on Thursday. A cordon was placed around the building as residents were evacuated following the find. Explosive ordnance disposal staff were called to the scene to examine the item before carrying out a controlled explosion despite the device being found to be “non-viable”. People who were registered to vote at Glen Tower have been told to attend an alternative polling station at Knowetop primary achool on Knowetop Avenue in Motherwell. A community room within the building was due to be used as a polling station. Ch Insp Mark Leonard said: “Police in Motherwell have arrested a 48-year-old man in connection with a suspicious device found on the ground floor of Glen Tower flats, Motherwell, around 1am on Thursday December 12 2019. Inquiries are ongoing.” Here’s a round up of some queuing news from PA Media.Waits of more than half an hour were reported at various locations across England on Thursday morning.Queuing appeared particularly widespread in London, with long lines reported in a number of constituencies.Chris Schofield said more than 70 voters were waiting in the Bermondsey and Old Southwark constituency - some of whom gave up and left during his 20-minute wait, “presumably to go to work”.“It’s about 20 times busier than it was in 2017, and for the locals and Euro elections,” the 27-year-old consultant said. “Atmosphere is very London: orderly queueing and no one is talking to each other!”Several voters claimed they had never seen queues like it in years.Asked why he thought there were so many queuing, Schofield said: “I think it’s the election of a lifetime for many of us.” Alixe Bovey reported queueing for 35 minutes in the Streatham constituency.“In 20 years of voting in Streatham Hill, always at about this time of day, I have never encountered a queue of more than six or seven people,” she tweeted.Waits were also reported in English cities such as Cambridge, where John Walsh tweeted to say it was the “first time ever” that he had to queue to exercise his democratic right.Voters unable to vote for whatever reason can return to their polling stations at any time before 10pm on Thursday evening.The Electoral Commission advises polling stations “can get very busy, particularly towards the end of the day”, but says voters in a queue before 10pm will be entitled to apply for a ballot paper.Voters in England, Scotland and Wales do not need to take anything with them to vote, while those in Northern Ireland must have photo ID.

The fun legends relating to the origins of the UK’s parakeets are probably not going to go away any time soon.”However, analysis by Le Comber and colleagues based on geographic profiling methods used to track down criminals concluded that Britain’s booming parakeet population has grown from numerous small-scale accidental and intentional pet releases.The analysis tested other popular theories, including that parakeets kept at Syon Park in west London escaped in the 1970s when a plane crashed through the aviary roof, or that damage to aviaries during the Great Storm of 1987 was responsible. However, none of the suspect sites showed up prominently in the heatmap of more than 5,000 unique records dating from 1968 to 2018.The research, published in the Journal of Zoology, drew on sightings recorded in the National Bioersity Network Atlas dating back to the 1960s. When this failed to produce an obvious hotspot of parrot activity, the researchers turned to newspaper archives, and a search turned up thousands of pages of news stories about parakeets written between 1804 and 2008.The team found numerous sensational accounts of human deaths due to so-called parrot fever, an infection called psittacosis, which has the potential to be passed from bird to human and which can be deadly. In 1932 the Middlesex County Times reported that parakeets had been spotted in Epping Forest and credited the “parrot disease scare” of 1931 for an increase in pet birds being released into the wild.A 1952 headline in London’s Daily Herald reported calls to “Stop import of danger parrots”, while a 1974 report in the Reading Evening Post described eight people falling sick after the death of a parrot.Steven Le Comber commented on the findings in August, when the research was submitted for publication. He died in September, aged 53."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19881050d55e63b93fa6d29a8a8e6334faad9b67/0_18_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c668145cae27742d8c7555a0dbdd8ec","title":"five ways to get your family into classical music","story":"Classical music offers something for everyone, says Kate Faithfull-Williams, from toddlers to teens to the kid rolling their eyes as they read this over your shoulder …Classical music can be daunting. With a genre dating back hundreds of years, the choices are overwhelming. So where do you start? With the benefits, that’s where.“Music brings people together and helps kids – and parents – listen better,” says composer John Webb, who has worked with everyone from five-year-old songwriters to traditional Indian musicians and a virtual symphony orchestra to introduce new audiences to classical music. Classical tracks are also scientifically proven to relieve stress, boost brainpower and even help us be more open emotionally – all good news for happy families. So, here’s how to get involved ...Toddlers and preschoolers“Young kids are innately musical,” says Webb, mimicking the singsong speech and extended vowel sounds we instinctively use with small people – “Ooh what a bee-yoo-tiful baby”. Children have an unrepressed desire to dance, too. “Kids move in different ways to different music, tiptoeing, stamping and twirling,” explains Webb.So how can you bring out the best in your mini maestro? Composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty topped the iTunes Classical Charts, says: “Try listening to Carnival of the Animals by Saint-Saëns, which describes lots of wild animals through music.”From age five to eightDid you know that this is the prime age for children to write music? “Kids naturally make up their own songs as they play,” says Webb, who generously describes those improvised 10-second tunes as, “mashups”. To enhance that natural ability, he advises using a story as a hook. “Kids love stories, and quickly understand that different notes and speeds of music create a sense of character. Classical music is easily simplified and it can be creative and powerful for children.”Want to get involved? Try something like the BBC Singers Family Concert (9 February 2020, Milton Court Concert Hall, Barbican, London prices from £5), which promises to be very interactive and is aimed at kids aged five and over. Alternatively, join the BBC Concert Orchestra at Musical Roots (22 February 2020, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Southbank Centre, London prices from £5) for a magical adventure the whole family can enjoy, exploring exciting and unusual connections between composers, their music and their families.From age nine to 12You may know that playing an instrument can improve a child’s memory and coordination, and teach them perseverance. You definitely know that persuading your pre-teen to practise playing an instrument is like lighting a stick of dynamite, so explosive are the arguments.The solution, suggests Davis, could be as simple as inspiring your child by letting them see someone older play their instrument expertly. The BBC is laying on two upcoming events that will transport young people into a different world and get them excited about playing.Try Family Total Immersion: Lift Off! (1 December, Barbican Hall, London prices from £5) with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, which celebrates 50 years since the moon landing with live music, interactive workshops and film to take you on a musical adventure through space. Best of all, there are more than two hours of drop-in foyer activities, including the chance for kids to try a variety of instruments before the show.David Walliams is also doing a special performance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra (2 May 2020, Barbican, London prices from £5), which is virtually guaranteed to hook kids into playing classical music. Walliams will read from his bestselling children’s books, including Bad Dad and The World’s Worst Children, alongside musical treats from a full orchestra.The teenage yearsCan parents introduce anything to their sceptical teen? “The kiss of death is for a parent to show keenness,” warns Webb. “Osmosis is your best bet, so play the pieces you like at home. Go for tracks with a pounding rhythm and bleakness, like Shostakovich Symphony No 5, as the raw energy and emotion may get your teen’s attention.”Film can also be a good entry point for teenagers. “I would always point towards innovative composers and performers who are very current,” says Davis. “So maybe don’t start with Mozart. Instead, go for composers like Max Richter, who scored Mary Queen of Scots, or Joby Talbot, who scored The League of Gentlemen. Both Richter and Talbot are also serious concert hall composers in their own right.” Talbot’s Everest will be performed with the BBC Symphony Orchestra next year (20 June 2020, Barbican Hall, London prices from £10).If all else fails …Stealth is a weapon at your disposal. “There are so many great concerts out there, but the mistake is dragging a reluctant child to a classical concert and expecting them to walk out enlightened and interested,” warns Davis. “So find an appropriate concert of music your child might grow to like and research the music that’s going to be performed. Play sections of it in the car and at home ahead of the concert. Otherwise it’s a huge amount to take in. As the composer Philip Glass once said: ‘People don’t know what they love, they love what they know.’”Learn more about getting the whole family into classical music with advice and events from the BBC’s Get Involved initiative"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ee784fcdd4027a5ef4fd8c71226c1032b8aeb04/0_52_1634_980/master/1634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=956a0dfa172a1c09e7f770c69bb77bda","title":"mindful music how listening to classical can help you be more present","story":"Classical music is known for its calming properties, but it’s more than pleasant background music. Jonathan Lennie chooses seven tracks that promote a feeling of mindfulness in the present momentLife can be chaotic – between work, family and social commitments many of us have difficulty switching off. And the thought of spending quality time on yourself is often forgotten. This is what mindfulness seeks to address. Non-judgmental moment-to-moment awareness is a form of meditation in which we engage with our thoughts and the world around us in the present moment. And being a spiritual art form of fixed duration, classical music is an ideal medium with which to practise it. Here are seven pieces of classical music that can transport us into a world of relaxation and wellbeing.Edward Elgar – Variations on an Original Theme, Op 36 (Enigma): 9 NimrodNimrod is one of a suite of short pieces from Edward Elgar’s Enigma Variations. In popular culture it has become a British anthem, though it was actually a cryptic tribute to his friend Augustus Jaeger. The enigmatic element of the work is useful in mindful listening, in that the overarching musical theme is intended as a mystery that need not be solved – like the mystery of life, to be dipped into as it occurs. Concentrate on what is actually happening in the music as you breathe along with the work’s gentle pulse, rather than zoning out as you anticipate the orchestral climax. The conception of the work is an instance of mindfulness itself. The composer was noodling at the piano when his wife pointed out that he had written a marvellous melody. He had allowed it to emerge, he later said, “from nothing”.You can listen to this piece live at the BBC Concert Orchestra’s Orchestra Unwrapped concert on 26 September.Pauline Oliveros – Deep Listening“Walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears,” said American experimental composer Pauline Oliveros. She became obsessed with mindfulness through “deep listening”, a term she coined in 1988 after descending four metres into a disused water tank to make a recording of the same name. The underground room had an acoustic resonance lasting 45 seconds, allowing the musicians to create a smooth overlapping texture by listening carefully to each other. The album Deep Listening presents four pieces conceived as an aid to mindful focus. Choose one of them, concentrate on the constant drone of the didgeridoo, then become aware of the slowly evolving sounds of accordion and voice as they expand and contract around it. Purge your mind of clutter as you focus on this swirling soundscape, allowing the melodic trombone line to order your thinking.Gustav Mahler – Symphony No 2 (Resurrection), UrlichtGustav Mahler declared that: “A symphony must be like the world. It must contain everything.” To experience his immense symphonies is, therefore, to musically engage with the vastness of the human experience, and his second is a case in point. It starts with a funeral march and questions the randomness of life, before concluding that it is wondrous and meaningful. This positivity begins in the fourth movement, Urlicht (Primal Light), a slow, simple song arranged for solo singer and sparse orchestra. When the choir, with full orchestra, enters for the final Resurrection movement and sings: “Die shall I in order to live rise again, yes rise again”, feel the energy flow through your body, swelling and expansive like the music.Johannes Ockeghem – Alma Redemptoris MaterIf ever there was a form of music designed for mindful reflection, it is Renaissance polyphony, which shows the beauty and complexity that can be achieved by voices alone. Alma Redemptoris Mater by Johannes Ockeghem is such an example. Written during the 15th century, this sacred motet is presented by just four voices. Close your eyes, breathe and follow the inidual vocal lines as they flow together and apart, weaving a rich harmonic tapestry of sound. Focus on the beauty of the words: “Loving mother of the redeemer, who opens the gate to heaven, and star of the sea … You who gave birth, in the wonderment of nature, to your own creator ...” After its five minutes duration, you should feel both calm and focused.You can listen to this piece performed live by the BBC Singers on 7 December.Ralph Vaughan Williams – The Lark AscendingThis exquisite musical depiction of a singing lark taking to the air has been described by British violinist Tasmin Little as “floating above a cushion of sound”. Its composer, Ralph Vaughan Williams was inspired by George Meredith’s poem The Lark Ascending. Read the poem, then listen to the music, focusing on the violin depicting the bird as “He rises and begins to round”. Observe the lark’s efforts to take flight: “As up he wings the spiral stair”, swooping as it trills “A song of light”. Follow its ascent, until at last the full orchestra glides with the creature, saluting its “Serenity in ravishment”. Finally, become the lark, letting your spirit fly free – and, in your mind’s eye, look down upon the rural landscape rolling beneath you.You can listen to this piece live at the BBC Symphony Orchestra concert on 1 November.Olivier Messiaen – Quartet for the End of TimeFrench composer Olivier Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time is an exceptional example of mindfulness. Incarcerated in a freezing prisoner of war camp, he created a piece about the end of time itself, when all earthly concerns will be swept away as foretold in the Revelation of St John. This extraordinary piece was premiered at the camp on old battered instruments in January 1941. By writing for the only instruments available (violin, cello, clarinet and piano), Messiaen was adapting to the moment, yet was focused on eternity. The mindful theme is also present in the musical structure itself, which is based on an unravelling mathematical sequence that, if played out, would be infinite.John Cage – 4’33’’Mindfulness is about time, specifically now. Consequently, the ultimate work of mindfulness might be John Cage’s 4’33’’. More of an experimental concept than piece of music, Cage’s 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence presents a set time framework in which a pianist (or any sologroup of musicians) sits at the piano and turns the pages of the empty score in silence. Meanwhile, the audience is invited to listen to the ambient sounds in the auditorium – breathing, air conditioning, the rumble of cars outside ... essentially, listening to the world around them as a unique aural event and appreciating its variety, rather than ignoring it as irrelevant noise. Of course, you don’t have to attend a concert to experience this – just set your timer, close your eyes and listen.Choose your own mindful listening from the BBC’s upcoming series of classical concerts from the BBC Symphony Orchestra, BBC Concert Orchestra and BBC Singers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae4395199abd2e5f588a39804555ebd7eb6327a8/98_100_888_533/master/888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfaa36247509e8f671eebeb4ef6deddc","title":"i just wanted to sing elizabeth llewellyns unorthodox journey to becoming a soprano","story":"Despite an illness forcing a decade-long hiatus, the singer’s career has moved from strength to strength. She tells  Tshepo Mokoena about her path into operaSome of us are destined to end up on a particular path, no matter what obstacles life may hurl in the way. Opera singer Elizabeth Llewellyn is one of those people. The 46-year-old’s unorthodox journey from her childhood in south London to breathtaking stage and concert performances around the world is testament to how there’s no singular route into classical music.At first glance, her story starts in a way you might expect, with a piqued childhood interest. Aged 10, Llewellyn began the piano lessons that would form the bedrock of her musical education. “I remember my piano teacher gave me a cassette of violinist Nigel Kennedy, playing a version of Vivaldi’s Four Seasons,” she says, speaking on a busy day in New York between rehearsals for an upcoming lead role in Porgy and Bess.As a child born to Jamaican parents and growing up in the 1980s, a career in opera may not have been an obvious choice. But Llewellyn has never been the type to follow the crowd.She quickly became hooked on classical music. “When you’re a child, you tend to get involved in whatever’s around you. So when you’re learning an instrument, you absorb what your teacher feeds you.” In her case, that entailed taking in classical music of all sorts, during lessons that stretched for hours at a time on Saturday afternoons. But that seemingly ordinary foray into music would start to ert for Llewellyn.Unlike many of her professional opera peers, she took a 10-year detour at the start of her 20s, when an inexplicable illness – akin to a series of incessant, persistent colds – forced her to leave Manchester’s prestigious Royal Northern College of Music and stop singing altogether. After working in everything from IT and telecoms to the travel industry, Llewellyn wound up back where she belonged: singing, for rapturous audiences. She debuted professionally as Mimì in La Bohème with the English National Opera in 2010, and will sing as part of a BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus performance in March 2020.Looking back, Llewellyn can trace her love for music from piano to an interest buoyed by “choirs, then learning the violin when I was about 13. I was involved in orchestra, and string orchestra, the string quartet …” and as her voice trails off you wonder how she managed to fit it all in around school itself. After being accepted to the Royal Northern College of Music, however, her entire perspective changed. “I was used to playing piano concertos with the school orchestra, singing solos in concerts,” she remembers fondly. “And then … you get to music college. And you realise you haven’t got any technique you’re not actually very good compared to everyone else around you” – and now she chuckles at the memory. “That first year, for me, was a bit of a horror,” a moment when she stopped and thought: “Oh my goodness, I’m really not that good am I?”Although she felt she had much to learn, Llewellyn’s always deployed an emotional heft in her singing. It’s part of the reason why, after several years away from music, a director of a local, amateur operatic music group noticed her talent and suggested she pursue opera with more commitment. After all, as she recalls: “Even when I applied for music college, I don’t think I wanted to be ‘an opera singer’. I just wanted to sing.”Though she’d not been immersed in opera from infancy – as is a more common background – she felt an undeniable compulsion to sing. And her time away from music proved pivotal to enriching her vocal delivery. She gained the life experience to pour into her work that she would otherwise have lacked, she thinks, had she leapt into the professional world as a teen.“Although I wouldn’t have chosen for things to have worked out that way,” she says, referencing the mysterious illness that derailed her, “I think I benefited from having that time away from the classical music scene. For singers, I think it’s really important to grow up emotionally and take time to absorb the world around you, and what it means to be human.” Though she half-jokes that “some of the plots of operas are fairly ridiculous”, she notes that “they are all rooted in real stories”.And so she’s looking forward to digging into some of that emotive and narrative flair as one of four soloists when Richard Farnes conducts Beethoven’s Missa solemnis, in March next year. “Vocally, it’s a really interesting piece to prepare for.” She considers it “a bit more ‘full-fat’ than, say, Mozart in terms of vocal approach”. Even listening to her describe the piece’s “muscularity” it’s clear that a passion like hers has the capacity to turn someone who normally avoids classical music into one willing to experience some, live.Llewellyn knows people may critique her, or look to knock her unusual route to success. But she’s adamant about the power of self-belief – after all, it got her this far. “You’ve got to know that your voice and your way of looking at the world, and your approach, is just as valid as the next person’s,” she says. “Your uniqueness and the thing that makes you you is really interesting. You can get pulled in lots of directions otherwise, and have no voice – and that’s death for an artist.” Chances are, even if others tried to pull her to and fro, Llewellyn would land on her feet. The stage is her home.Listen to Elizabeth Llewellyn live as she joins three other stunning soloists and conductor Richard Farnes for Beethoven’s Missa solemnis"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe915ca54e7af0c84420f550b290b3d7bf216b2e/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a482d2bd2b0b2de9db43d8d43be8f8cd","title":"leave the tuxedo at home classical music myths explored","story":"Don’t get caught up in outdated beliefs – classical music offers something for everyone, says Jonathan Lennie Despite the best efforts of orchestras and opera companies to attract a new and younger audience, some classical music myths still abound. Somehow, there persists an idea that classical concerts are very formal events in which people in tuxedos and ballgowns buy very expensive tickets to hear ancient, irrelevant music, performed by ageing men dressed like they are from the 19th century. And, even if you did manage to pass the classical music quiz to get in, they would soon spot your inappropriate behaviour and, not being an expert, you would have no idea what is going on, right? Wrong. None of that is true, of course.Trainers allowedModern audiences come in all shapes and sizes, and are as likely to be dressed in a T-shirt and jeans as in a suit and tie. What’s more, compared with other forms of entertainment, prices are very reasonable. Tickets for the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican in London, for instance, start at £12, or less if you take advantage of a young person’s scheme – certainly cheaper than a football match or the cinema in London, and not much to witness 90 professional musicians playing some of the world’s greatest music.Enjoy in unexpected placesMost performances take place in concert halls, but classical music is very erse – some concerts will feature a full symphony orchestra, others just a choir, a string quartet or even a solo pianist. Pieces for these smaller ensembles are called chamber music and are often presented in more intimate spaces, but over the past 10 years or so there has been a movement to present classical music outside of traditional venues altogether. The Multi-Story Orchestra, for instance, consists of young professional musicians playing a classical summer series at a multi-storey car park in London’s Peckham. Then there is Nonclassical, founded by classical composer and dance, grime, electro and hip-hop producer Gabriel Prokofiev, which puts on regular classical music gigs in pubs.Silence is not always goldenWhen it comes to concert etiquette, most concert halls – like most theatres – expect a degree of quiet attention from the audience. However, some organisations, such as BBC National Orchestra of Wales offer no-rules concerts. In its Classical Playlist: Live, audience members are encouraged to walk around, have a drink, keep their phones on and even take photos (Brangwyn Hall, Swansea, 5 October 2019). English National Opera (the London-based company that performs all its repertoire in English) is offering a relaxed performance of Gilbert and Sullivan’s comedy The Mikado, to encourage autistic adults and children to attend, inviting them to make noise if they like, while dimming the lights and removing any loud noises (23 November 2019).Beginners welcomeAs for not knowing what’s going on, all concerts provide a programme to read, explaining the background to the music you are hearing, and these are often free. The BBC even has a Discover New Music series, which includes its day-long Total Immersion events. (On 7 December 2019 at the Barbican, London, German composer Detlev Glanert’s work will be explored through film, interview and concerts with the BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.) Meanwhile, there’s also a series entitled Classical for Starters – the BBC Concert Orchestra’s recent Orchestra Unwrapped saw Alice Farnham conducting pieces by Mozart and Stravinsky, alongside well-known film music by John Williams. A month later, Dalia Stasevska conducts the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Rachmaninov’s sprightly Symphonic Dances (26 October 2019, Barbican, London). You may have noted that the conductors just mentioned are both women – the days of exclusively male orchestras conducted by old men are long gone. Indeed, BBC Symphony Orchestra has just appointed young British conductor Jules Buckley as its new creative artist in association. Buckley says he is eager “to innovate and challenge the stereotypes of what orchestral music should be”. His first concert with the orchestra will be at the Barbican, London, on Friday 28 February 2020 and features soul singer Lianne La Havas. Previously, Buckley has joined in the BBC Proms concerts at the Royal Albert Hall with erse programmes such as this year’s The Breaks, exploring the world of scratch DJs, hip-hop and breakdancing (6 September 2019).A millennium of varietyFinally, the assumption that classical music all sounds the same is clearly erroneous, given that it stretches back nearly a thousand years. From choirs singing mediaeval vocal polyphony, Tudor viol consorts, to songs for piano and voice, and vast modern-day orchestras, the scale and variety of music is incomparable. So while the incredible works of Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms will always have a place on the concert platform, there are plenty of pieces by modern, living composers too. Anna Meredith’s music, for example, embraces both electronica and traditional instruments – she has even written a Concerto for Orchestra and Beatboxer. Then there’s David Lang, whose fresh take on Beethoven’s Fidelio, Prisoner of the State, is a stripped-down opera with the orchestra on stage (11 January, Barbican). Spanning everything from medieval polyphony to beatboxing, there is no one single thing that is classical music – and the same is true for its audiences. All you have to do is turn up, buy a ticket and enjoy.Start your classical music journey with concerts from the BBC’s Classical for Starters series"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b94fe54eb8f09bc6a4d79273cb6c7ffe9ff71224/0_101_3769_2262/master/3769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56e38981e4bc8054d8f188b352adc852","title":"anthony rendon los angeles angels contract mlb baseball","story":"Third baseman Anthony Rendon and the Los Angeles Angels agreed to a $245m, seven-year contract Wednesday, a source has told the Associated Press. The news was also reported by MLB Network and ESPN.Rendon will get a $4m signing bonus, and salaries of $25.5m next season, $27.5m in 2021, $36m in 2022 and $38m each year from 2023-26. He would receive a $250,000 bonus for World Series MVP, $150,000 for League Championship Series MVP, $125,000 for election as an All-Star starter and $100,000 for selection as a reserve.Rendon is the third prized free agent to strike a big-money deal at this week’s baseball winter meetings. He’ll join three-time MVPs Mike Trout and Albert Pujols on a team that’s made just one postseason appearance in the past decade.The Angels had missed out on free agent right-hander Gerrit Cole, who agreed to a record $324m, nine-year contract with the New York Yankees on Tuesday night, according to multiple reports.“With our flexibility, if we miss a big player, there’s still very talented players that are accessible in the free agent and trade market right now,” Angels general manager Billy Eppler said on Wednesday, before news of the deal came out.Rendon, who has played all seven of his major league seasons with Washington, drove in a career-best 126 runs while helping the Nationals capture the franchise’s first World Series championship this year. His 19.9 Wins Above Replacement, per FanGraphs, over the past four seasons trails only Trout, Boston’s Mookie Betts and Milwaukee’s Christian Yelich among position players. Rendon is the latest big signing by owner Arte Moreno, following Pujols, Shohei Ohtani, Josh Hamilton and CJ Wilson. “We’re within some structure of a budget and a payroll forecast that you relatively want to be near and then we just take those opportunities to Arte and see if he’ll grant us the permission to do those things,” Eppler said. “There’s good players out there and players that warrant some sizeable contracts. I know the players that he likes.” Rendon follows Bryce Harper as a homegrown star in Washington to leave via free agency. Harper signed a $330m, 13-year deal with the Philadelphia Phillies last March. The Nationals had remained in contact with the 29-year-old Rendon’s representatives on Wednesday, according to general manager Mike Rizzo.“The third base market specifically is an active market,” Rizzo said. “There are several teams that are in the market for that particular position. I think it will move fairly rapidly, not only in the free-agent market but in the trade market I think we’ll see some activity.”After the news broke, Nationals shortstop Trea Turner tweeted video of himself kicking around a t-shirt featuring a picture of Rendon’s face and the message: “Anthony is my favorite player.”It marks the fourth big free-agent deal of the offseason pulled off by agent Scott Boras. Infielder Mike Moustakas joined the Cincinnati Reds on a $64m, four-year contract, then right-hander Stephen Strasburg reached a $245m, seven-year contract on Monday to stay with the Nationals before Cole’s pending signing came together a day later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/396865be011e2f6137d121853f370047b1c02328/1857_1465_3613_2168/master/3613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f4476be2dc0f63f369d0fbdb9cdf0aa","title":"ferrari flattered lewis hamilton talks f1 move","story":"• Ferrari admit they have spoken with world champion• Ferrari would veto bid by Mercedes chief Toto Wolff to run F1Ferrari have admitted for the first time that Lewis Hamilton, whose £40m-a-year deal with Mercedes expires at the end of next season, has discussed joining them.Ferrari’s no-nonsense chief executive, Louis Camilleri, also scuppered any ambition Toto Wolff has of leaving Mercedes to run Formula One by stating the Scuderia would be prepared to block such a move.Although Hamilton refused to deny a report at the final race in Abu Dhabi that he had met the Ferrari chairman, John Elkann, Camilleri confirmed discussions with the six-times world champion over one of F1’s biggest transfers have taken place.“It has been made public that Lewis has had conversations with our chairman,” said Camilleri in a revealing season debrief at the Italian team’s Maranello headquarters. “We clearly are very flattered that Lewis in particular and other drivers want to come and join us. Every driver on the grid would like to drive a Ferrari.Hamilton, who will be 35 next month, has indicated his next move will depend on the future of Wolff. The 47-year-old Mercedes team principal has been touted by the sport’s American owners’ Liberty Media as a prime candidate to take over from Chase Carey and run F1 beyond next year.Camilleri said Ferrari would be prepared to use their veto to stop Wolff, who has presided over Mercedes’ unprecedented run of success in recent years, being handed the keys to the sport.“Anybody who has been an active and important player in a certain team within the last years to take on the responsibility at F1 would create a conflict of interest,” Camilleri said. “It would not be a good thing that Wolff should ultimately run F1.Ferrari’s campaign was blighted by a series of errors by their drivers and strategical mistakes. Leclerc’s breakthrough season also forced Ferrari to drop Vettel as their No 1 driver. The four-times world champion, who is paid £36m a year, would be moved on if the Italians signed Hamilton.“Clearly Charles’ performance has had an impact,” Camilleri said. “That’s inevitable when you’re the world champion and this young kid comes along and has a phenomenal season. Charles has a lot of talent. He has surprised even ourselves as to what he has been capable of.“Their collision last month in Brazil was a nightmare. However, the air has been cleared. And sometimes you need a crisis to put the goalposts in the appropriate place.

Smith finally fell for it when he pulled Neil Wagner straight to Tim Southee at leg trap, marking the second straight time he has been out in that fashion to New Zealand.The innings was the slowest of the right-hander’s career when he has scored above 20, as he fought hard for 43 from 164 balls at a strike-rate of 26.21 He did not hit his first boundary until his 52nd ball and was later dropped on 19 at second slip by Tom Latham when he flayed away at Ferguson.Labuschagne meanwhile was brilliant at the other end, as he became the first Australian No 3 since Don Bradman to hit three consecutive centuries. The Queenslander started watchfully in a dogged first session and a half, before taking control of the game.As he got more expansive so did he score. He brought up his 50 when he uppercut Ferguson for four, while his century came up when he jumped down the wicket and hit Mitchell Santner for six over long on.Labuschagne now averages 89.88 since being called into the Australia side as a concussion substitute for Smith at Lord’s in the Ashes this year. His 132-run stand with Smith for the third wicket here was the second century partnership he has enjoyed with the man he so closely resembles in quirky traits.Wagner (with two for 52) had earlier taken the catch of the season to remove the in-form David Warner for 43. With Warner looking set for another big innings he bunted a low full toss back at the left-armer Wagner just before tea. The ball never went above shin height and the Black Caps quick fell low to his right and took the ball with one hand.It was only the second time Warner has been dismissed this Test summer, having amassed 532 runs after a big series against Pakistan. Joe Burns was the first man out, trapped lbw by Colin de Grandhomme on nine before ball tracking later showed he would have been not out had he reviewed it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0764efb6ee390ddaef6bbc81249b999a8639a28/0_145_3211_1927/master/3211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c33620f33b77cfaab1692c4d93927d5b","title":"nat sciver century leads england women to series win over pakistan cricket","story":"Natalie Sciver scored a series-clinching unbeaten century as England women made it back-to-back wins over Pakistan with victory by 127 runs in the second ODI in Kuala Lumpur.Sciver made 100 off 85 balls while captain Heather Knight made 86 off 100 and Fran Wilson clubbed three sixes as she contributed 85 off just 49 balls, helping England set an imposing target of 328.Pakistan never truly looked like troubling it as they slipped behind the required run rate early on, and the contest was over after they slipped from 140 for three to 145 for six.The wickets were shared around, with two apiece for Anya Shrubsole, Sarah Glenn, Sophie Ecclestone and Knight – who was named player of the match.“I was really happy to reach three figures, from a selfish point of view, but it was just nice to take the team to a big total,” Sciver said.“Fran batted so well when she came in and she really helped us accelerate towards 300 and beyond - it was a lot of fun batting with her and she played excellently.“It was a shame Heather didn’t get to her landmark because she batted so well and it would have been a lovely way for her to celebrate getting to 100 caps.“Pakistan have been quite testing, they were hard to get away at points today and they were solid with the bat so we’re happy to have gone 2-0 up and won the series.”There is one match still to play in the series on Saturday.

But in the attic studio of the Egg theatre lies just a handful of large geometric blocks. Is this really the set for a wintry tale of a hungry squirrel? And we’d expect some rousing singalong songs at this time of year. But it’s the understated syncopation of jazz that we hear. And who is our host for the next half hour? It’s Caroline Garland, whose culottes, beret and stripy tee make her look like an escapee from a sun-kissed 1950s caper on the Riviera.This is an unusually cool, even chic children’s production, but it’s also supremely welcoming and warm-hearted, with an understanding of its under-five audiences that is as sophisticated as its cultural references. Yes, the set looks like we’ve found ourselves inside a Bauhaus model but the kids are soon making slides out of the shapes and picking up tubes that resemble finished rolls of wrapping paper.Anyone who has spent a family show trying to keep a toddler in their seat can rest easy: Tim Bell and Kate Cross’s production enables its young audience to take part throughout. When a squirrel puppet pops out of a box, Garland takes it twitching and scrabbling up close to the children. Marc Parrett’s design is remarkably lifelike, neither Disneyfied nor anthropomorphised. That tummy isn’t as plump as it might be, the tail ratty rather than bushy: this squirrel really does look hungry. When it cocks its head and sets beady eyes on me I half suspect it will gnaw my toes.Productions for this age group often end with a bit of playtime. Here, Garland improvises and encourages the children as they stroll on and off the stage throughout the entire show,. yet she remains calmly in control of the story. One minute she sets off a chain of whispers around the audience about what will happen next later she demonstrates a simple game and lets the children get on with their own versions of it.At the end, Anisha Fields’ stylish, clever set reveals a flurry of surprises. The blocks, cones and balls spill all over the stage and suddenly resemble a forest landscape.

Take a traditional alarm system, make it wireless and inject a bit of smart into it without trying to do too much and making it over-complicated.The system comes in a kit with one contact sensor, one motion detector, a keypad, a range extender and the base station, which connects to your home wifi and contains a very loud siren. It’s enough to get you started, but if you have more than one entry door or ground-floor windows, you will probably need at least one more contact sensor or motion detector.The Ring Alarm is a DIY, wireless solution, which makes it rental-friendly. You can screw everything in place if you want or, as I did, simply stick the various bits in place with foam fixers.Installation was surprisingly straightforward and easy. You’ll need a Ring account, and its app on your smartphone, which guides you through the whole process. Plug the base station into power and hook it up to your home network via ethernet or wifi.Then it’s simply a process of pulling the battery tabs out of the various bits one by one and choosing where to put them. The whole lot can be done in about 15 minutes if you know where you want everything to go.The system uses the Z-Wave wireless protocol, not wifi, to connect to the various different components, reaching up to 76 metres from the base station. A range extender is included in the kit, but each device works as its own range extender, so unless you live in a really big house or have thick walls and obstructions, you probably won’t need it.The user-replaceable 3V lithium batteries in the contact and motion sensors should last about three years, while the rechargeable battery in the keypad lasts between six and nine months. It can also be left plugged into the microUSB power adapter if you have a plug socket where you want it mounted.The keypad arms and disarms the system like any traditional alarm. Type in your four-digit pin and press the “Away” button, which triggers a 60-second timer accompanied by a red light and what sounds like a game-show countdown tone for you to get out the door. Both the keypad and the base station make a noise and flash to let you know what’s going on during arming or disarming.When you come home, simply punch in your pin and hit the “Disarm” button before the entry delay timer runs out. There’s also a “Home” mode for when you’re staying in, which arms only the contact sensors by default. The LED ring on the base station shines red when the alarm is set or blue when it’s off.The keypad charges via microUSB and can be mounted practically anywhere. I stuck it to the wall behind the front door for convenience.The alarm worked faultlessly in my two-month test, going off when it should and not when it shouldn’t. The motion sensors weren’t errantly triggered by flashes of light, as some can be. You can also tailor the motion sensor sensitivity to stop it being activated by pets – though as my home is pet-free, I couldn’t test how well this works with cats or dogs.As a basic, easy-to-install wireless alarm, the system excels, but it’s also a little bit smarter than most.You can control the whole thing from the Ring app, which means you can arm and disarm it remotely. You can get notifications when things happen, see the states of various sensors such as when a door was opened or closed, see battery levels of the various bits, and change settings such as brightness of LEDs or volume level of alerts.One of the best features is the ability to give everyone their own pin, which means you can see who armed or disarmed the alarm and when. That includes guest codes, handy for neighbours or tradespeople, which can be set to operate on a schedule for extra security.The alarm system can also integrate with any other Ring products you might have. You can set cameras to record, floodlights to fire up and other bits when the delay entry or alarm is triggered.The Ring Alarm works just fine without a monthly subscription, but a Ring Protect Plus subscription of £8 a month or £80 a year adds two extras. The first is a 3G backup connection that activates when your internet goes down, meaning the alarm still works when there’s a power cut.The second is optional assisted monitoring. When the alarm goes off, Ring’s automated system phones through a list of people until it gets an answer.One Ring Protect Plus subscription works with all Ring devices in your house, so if you have cameras, you get 30 days of video events and snapshots as well as a few other things.It’s worth noting that Ring is under scrutiny for the way it links with police in the US, and the use of its Neighbors app, and the use by users of footage captured by its cameras. As with any smart device, whether or not you should use it comes down to whether you trust the manufacturer – in this case Amazon. The alarm system potentially raises fewer privacy concerns, however, as it doesn’t need cameras to operate.The Ring Alarm starter kit costs £249 in the UK or $199 in the US. Additional contact sensors cost £29$20, motion sensors cost £39$30 and keypads cost £59$50.For comparison, smart alarm systems from traditional manufacturers such as Yale start at £150 for the most basic kits and scale quickly with the number of sensors, sirens and keypads required.The Ring Alarm manages something that few smart home devices do: it’s a simple, effective product that isn’t worse just because it’s smart.Day to day, you can just use the simple, quality-looking keypad and go about your day. It’s easy to install, rental-friendly, straightforward to use and adaptable to various needs. It doesn’t try to do too much, it’s just a good alarm in and of itself, and doesn’t need a single other Ring product to work well.The Ring app is also well-designed, responsive and works reliably - something that can’t be said of some more established competitors. The smart bits, such as being able to get alerts when things happen, remotely control the alarm and review events from inidual sensors, are good too, as is the ability to generate unique pins for guests or tradespeople.Having a backup battery in everything, plus the option of backup 3G, also means the alarm is dependable, even if the power goes out. I felt an extra-level of reassurance having the Ring Alarm system installed and armed compared to just having smart cameras set up while on a recent holiday.Start integrating other smart devices you have in your home and you can build some really sophisticated security systems.One thing the Ring Alarm kit and components are not is cheap - at least in the UK, where it is significantly more expensive than in the US. Competitors from traditional security firms start cheaper, but scale in a similar way with inidual sensors.If you want a simple DIY wireless alarm that’s easy to install and use, but you also want to be able to monitor it remotely and for it to be smart without being overloaded, Ring’s Alarm is an excellent option that was worth waiting for.Pros: wireless, effective, simple to install, rental-friendly, smart but not complicated, works as well as a traditional alarm, expandable, dependable, good app, inidual pins, temporary pins, integrates with other smart devices and camerasCons: costs bit more than competitors, contact and motion sensors are fairly large, no keyfobNFC option"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bae2b1ddb087880ce7645e151531bb1f9ad6876c/0_35_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=007de6d8751364411dfba8025f4e470c","title":"best new european rail journeys 2020 vienna brussels berlin","story":"Timetables for the year ahead highlight new day and night services across Europe to destinations including Vienna, Brussels and Berlin, with easy connections into eastern EuropeAnd now for some good news … rail operators across Europe are responding to a growing interest in travel by train with the launch of a number of new services. Particularly exciting for fans of sleeper trains is the launch of several new overnight services, in a welcome reversal of a recent trend among operators to drop night trains.The switchover to new 2020 timetables takes place in the early hours of Sunday 15 December (though not all services will start on that exact date: some only start in the new year or spring 2020).Previous years have seen the launch of new European high-speed lines, such as the new fast links from Paris to Strasbourg and Bordeaux, and a bold new high-speed line through the hill country of Thuringia, bringing travel time from Berlin to Munich down to four hours.The are no route openings for 2020 but the new timetables demonstrate how European rail operators are developing new services to make optimal use of existing infrastructure. Notable among them is Österreichische Bundesbahnen (OBB), Austria’s main rail operator, which is expanding its network of daytime trains (branded Railjet or Eurocity) and overnight trains (Nightjet). In doing so, it establishes Vienna as the best-connected city by rail in Europe in 2020. Only Moscow comes close in having connections to so many other European capitals.15 hoursLaunches 20 January 2020In the last few years many European sleeper trains have been phased out, so OBB’s launch of new overnight services is a welcome introduction. In 2019, the company started to offer new overnight services between many cities across Europe – all served by comfortable sleeping cars, many with optional en suite facilities. New services included overnight links from Berlin to cities in Poland, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary. Now the spotlight is on Belgium, with direct twice-weekly night trains from Brussels to Vienna, Munich and Innsbruck.By the end of 2020, these new services will be running every night, which is great news for UK passengers looking to connect with Europe’s night train network on the Eurostar via Brussels. The new services make it easier to reach Tirolean resorts and cities such as Vienna and Budapest by train. It will be possible to leave London after lunch and, with just two changes of train (Brussels and Vienna), be in Romania or Serbia by the following afternoon.Other new night trains on the horizon for later in 2020 include direct services from Amsterdam to Bavaria, the Austrian Tirol and Vienna.7 hoursLaunches 15 DecemberOBB is also expanding its daytime services, with a new daily Railjet service from Vienna via Salzburg and Innsbruck to Bolzano, capital of the largely German-speaking Südtirol region of Italy, an area with strong eco-credentials where visitors are encouraged to explore by public transport. This will be the first time OBB’s smart, red Railjet trains have run on regular scheduled services over the Brenner Pass into Italy. The company’s twice-daily services from Vienna to Venice via the classic Semmering route through the Alps have been a big success, so the launch of comfortable Railjets over the mountainous Brenner line looks set to be a winner.11 hoursLaunches 4 MayEarly May will see the launch of a new daily Railjet train from Graz, Austria’s arty second city, via Vienna and Prague, to Dresden and Berlin. This will be the first time that scheduled Railjet stock has run regularly into eastern Germany, with the reinstatement of direct trains between Saxony and Austria. This new train is in addition to the two Berlin to Vienna trains introduced in 2018, both of which take quite different routes from the Railjet: the night train running via Wrocław and Ostrava, and the daytime service via Erfurt and Regensburg.9 hoursLaunches 15 DecemberThe number of direct daily trains from Vienna to Debrecen in eastern Hungary will be increased with a second daily Eurocity service. The new train will leave Vienna at 10.42 each morning (complementing the existing late-afternoon departure) and continue beyond Debrecen to Satu Mare in northern Romania. This is the gateway to the forested Maramureș region, famed for its wooden churches and ancient traditions. This new service is branded Eurocity by ÖBB, and it’s one of a number of new launches this month. Another adventurous new service is a daily train from Graz to Przemyśl, gateway to the south-eastern Carpathian region of Poland. The last stop before the border with Ukraine, from Przemyśl there are onward services to Lviv, Kyiv and many other Ukrainian cities.Not all the rail action is with ÖBB. Here are three examples of other new services that start this month4 hoursLaunches 15 DecemberFor years, there have been few fast train services in Germany between Saxony, in the east, and the Baltic coast. That changes with the launch of a new direct Deutsche Bahn (DB) Inter-City (IC) service from Dresden via Berlin to Rostock. The route will be served by four or five trains in each direction from 15 December, increasing to eight in March 2020. In May next year, the route will be extended north from Rostock to the coastal resort of Warnemünde.Various times and datesIn the UK, the most notable timetable change is a major revamp of schedules out of London Paddington on the main Great Western Railway route to Bristol, south-west England and Wales. Highlights include regular sub-two-hour timings from London to Cardiff. The fastest trains will dash to the Welsh capital in 102 minutes, making just two stops (Bristol Parkway and Newport). The new headline timing from London to Bristol Parkway will be just 68 minutes.4 hoursLaunches 15 DecemberThis isn’t a new route, but from mid-December trains will no longer be routed via the rail-ferry link from Puttgarden (Germany) to Rødby (Denmark). Instead, these Eurocity trains, run by Danish national operator DSB, will go via the Jutland route, and Odense, to reach the Danish capital. It’ll be 18 minutes faster but won’t quite have the romance of the entire train shipped onto a ferry to Denmark.This is an extract from Hidden Europe magazine.Nicky Gardner is co-author of Europe by Rail: The Definitive Guide.

Here’s what some of them saidVery happy that we now have a young female PM with fresh new thoughts on how to lead our beautiful country. She is well educated, bright and does not take any BS from anybody. She is a strong independent woman and a bright new star for her generation. I’m sure she will make a good example for all the young men and women of our world. It’s the young people that need to take over as they are the ones living here long after my generation has passed. Veikko, 65, Ilomantsi, FinlandI cannot recall when politics last made me cry tears of happiness. This did. I experienced my political awakening at age 16. The power that rose from the 2015 elections four years later didn’t look like me. This, now, is what politics is supposed to look like. It is supposed to look into the future, think of the welfare of the people. Ella Kivisaari, student, Helsinki, FinlandShe’s going to have a challenging time finding a way to fund government spending and find a path to improving employment. She’s fresh, popular and brings a major improvement in communication skills but also needs to break her ties with her predecessor Antti Rinne to be able to avoid an impression of being a marionette of his. Ilkka Kivi, 48, works in IT, Espoo, FinlandBest choice for prime minister. Our political party has long needed ‘fresh air’. Sanna is very good at speaking in the media and doesn’t hesitate to say her opinion. I’m very pleased. The opposition parties will have to face a lady in parliament and I’m loving it. Finland faces a bright future with Sanna Marin! Teemu Lintumaa, 35, FinlandShe seems competent and will probably do alright, but I would say that her appointment is almost like an act of desperation from her party. The SDP is in a similar downfall such as so many former ruling parties across Europe, with their voter base leaking both to the far-right, far-left and to the greens. She is basically their only politician with star power, and they are now pulling her from the sleeve to save them from oblivion. Whether that will work is yet to be seen, but basically this appointment is about a 20th century party trying to be hip, cool and relevant in the 21st century. Mikko Damskägg, 28, student, HelsinkiI first met Sanna Marin around 10 years ago in an election panel. She stood out from the other panelists in a most positive way, with deep knowledge and formidable arguments. Over the years, she has proven herself as one of Finland’s most apt politicians. I am so very happy and proud that she is our prime minister. Jari Kallio, 46, journalist and teacher, TampereI’m super excited and happy about our new PM! I think she’s starting a whole new chapter in Finnish politics by lifting up some really important values like equality, climate change and solidarity between people. Finland has been led by more or less right-wing politicians for over 15 years and since the actual election things have started to change in Finland for the better. Sanna Marin as our new PM will surely keep our new government in order and work towards the goals set six months ago. To see a young woman rise up to this position makes me really happy. Jarkko Veijanen, 39, project manager for a telephone company, Jyväskylä, FinlandIt’s great to see women and young women on the frontline in politics. We’ve been hailed as a very equal country but even now the comments regarding Marin’s appointment still leave me speechless. Her age, education, experience in both ‘normal jobs’ as well as politics are being questioned and I’m quite sure this wouldn’t have been the case if Antti Lindtman was appointed instead. I’m so disappointed in Finns not even giving her a chance.

The mass of presents and overflowing rubbish bins rather misses the point,” it says in its (Time not Stuff appeal, using words that might seem more at home in a vicar’s advent sermon. BSR, which serves 2 million households in Berlin, suggests alternative ways of celebrating to help the environment and ease the public purse.“One of our most precious commodities is our time,” it says. “So that’s what you should gift. How about an evening of cooking with someone, or a trip to a concert or cinema? Everyone likes to have nice memories”.It recommends giving the parents of young children a “babysitting voucher”, or holding clothes’ swap and share parties with friends, and visiting upcycling shops across the city as well as its own swap shop.BSR also advises being inventive with the remains of the Christmas goose or carp rather than throwing them in the compost bin. It urges Berliners to avoid drinking spicy punch and Glühwein (mulled wine) out of disposable cups “when ceramic ones will do”, pointing out that throughout the year 20,000 disposable cups are thrown away every hour in the city and the number is at its peak at Christmas.It suggests if Berliners want to give material gifts, they should make their own, such as knitting a hat or making chutney – and to wrap presents in toilet roll, newspaper, or pieces of fabric instead of plastic packaging and aluminium.As well as daily craft tips on its Twitter page throughout advent, such as an elk made from a toilet roll, it offers a video demonstration of how to make tree decorations out of egg boxes.

Lawmakers were debating late into the night on holding the vote on 2 March.Israel has been gripped by political paralysis for the best part of a year after two inconclusive votes gave neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor his rival, Benny Gantz, a clear lead.Both men have attempted to cobble together a 61-seat majority, while also stalling each other’s plays for power. A final 21-day period in which any parliamentarian could be nominated as prime minister also ended with no frontrunner.The development is seen as a boon for Netanyahu who had feared a last-minute deal by the opposition would end his decade-long run in power.However, under indictment in three substantial corruption cases and facing a small but vocal party mutiny, the leader of the right-wing Likud party immediately enters a new battle. The looming charges have weakened Israel’s longest-serving leader, and he will likely have to face a party leadership primary on 26 December.He is largely expected to win, although recent polling suggests his popularity may have taken a hit for the forthcoming national election.The political stalemate has played out during a fraught time for Israel. While politicians have bickered and traded blame, the country has fought on-off fights with militants in Gaza. Meanwhile, an increasingly open conflict heats up with Iran, Israel’s arch-enemy and a regional powerhouse.One option to end the domestic crisis was for the two main parties to join together in a unity government, as they would have more than enough support for a 61-seat majority. But there have been vast differences between the rivals during negotiations on key aspects such as how the next administration will look, including who leads it.Gantz ran his election campaign on the promise to topple Netanyahu, making it difficult for the opposition leader to accept a power-sharing deal without losing credibility.The prime minister has insisted his traditional allies from hardline nationalists to religious parties be included in any unity government, a precondition Gantz has rejected.Netanyahu was also reported to have demanded he serve first under any rotation agreement with Gantz, as he would want to remain in office as the court cases start rolling. If he retains the role of prime minister, he is not legally-obliged to step down from public office and could use his position to push for immunity. Netanyahu has denied all allegations as a “witch-hunt”.Fresh elections are expected to cost hundreds of millions of pounds and many fear bitter campaigns seen in the previous two rounds will further ide the country. Netanyahu was widely accused of racist scaremongering focused on Israel’s Arab minority to rally support.“Keep your children away from the television,” said Yair Lapid, a senior member of Blue and White, saying the campaign will be a “festival of hate, violence and disgust”.“What used to be a celebration of democracy has become a moment of shame for this building,” he added. “There are only three reasons for this election — bribery, fraud and breach of trust,” he said, referring to the criminal charges filed against Netanyahu.Netanyahu did not attend Wednesday night’s vote. In a video on social media, he accused Gantz of conspiring with Arab leaders and “forcing” new elections. “In order to prevent this happening again, there is only one thing we must do: win and win big,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4113228.1576158273!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fai reform group wants board appointments shake up","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Sport Shane Ross said the FAI was ‘a complete and utter basketcase’.  Photograph: Laura HuttonThe .A group of FAI employees, politicians and independent football figures are working on a plan to redraw how the FAI board is appointed.The group, which has met with long-time FAI critics Niall Quinn and Brian Kerr, envisages enforcing significant changes to how the board of the association is selected, and also splitting the FAI into two organisations.Currently, the board is selected by the council of the FAI, which is drawn from the smaller leagues and provincial associations. Sources close to the plan said the changes envisaged by the group would entail directors being appointed after an independent process. During this process, there would be a close examination of their qualifications. Details of the plan to split the organisation in two first emerged in this morning’s Irish Independent. It is understood that the plan to split grassroots and professional football originated in the FAI among a group of employees, and is loosely based on a similar structure in Welsh football. Elements of the plan have been in circulation in football circles, but it evolved during and after a meeting organised by Labour Party senator Aodhan O’ Riordan and party leader Brendan Howlin in Leinster House this week. The group is hoping to meet with senior politicians and civil servants as it moves the plan forward. Extremely complicatedHowever, sources in the football community said the success of the group’s proposals is far from assured. The proposals, in whole or in part, would be extremely complicated given how Irish football is run. If the association was to devolve responsibility for the grassroots game to a new organisation, that would likely need endorsement by the smaller clubs and leagues themselves. Such a project could prove logistically challenging, and any major reform to the council system may also face opposition from elements within the grassroots, some of whom feel it gives them a voice in governance at the national level. Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast, Minister for Sport Shane Ross said he was open to talk to anybody with “constructive suggestions about the FAI, because the FAI is a complete and utter basketcase, it’s in a very, very dark place at the moment.”“If we’ve got people like Brian Kerr and Niall Quinn who are going to make suggestions, I would be very happy to talk to them about it.”He said the government’s interest is in protecting funding - the €2.9 million in Sport Ireland funding which is given to the game every year. The government is devising a mechanism to channel the money into the grassroots without it going through the FAI, which Mr Ross said he hoped would be ready by next week. “The Government can’t believe the association which runs Irish football has sunk to such an awful low,” Mr Ross said.“What we cannot believe - and I cannot understand, and I think is quite unforgivable - is that the independent directors who were promised to us for so long have still not been appointed by the FAI.“We’ve got to see an organisation which is independent of what’s happened in the past - that’s terribly important.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4113281.1576156920!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"d%C3%A1il committee says it cannot investigate dara murphy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDara Murphy had the lowest attendance record of all TDs by a considerable margin. Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsThe Dáil’s internal ethics committee has said it does not have the power to investigate complaints about the former Fine Gael TD Dara Murphy.The Members’ Interests Committee met on Thursday morning to consider a request from Fianna Fáil whip Michael Moynihan that it inquire into Mr Murphy’s attendance record.The Cork North Central TD has been in Leinster House on 24 sitting days out of 70 in the first nine months of 2019, and 42 of the 104 sitting days during the whole of 2018. It is the lowest attendance record of all TDs by a considerable margin.Two sources on the committee said it would now write to Mr Moynihan and tell him that they could not investigate the issue and they could not direct the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) to do so either. This is because Mr Murphy is no longer a TD.The committee has also deferred a decision on whether to censure two Fianna Fáil TDs, Niall Collins and Timmy Dooley, over the voting controversy until the new year. It follows a meeting on Thursday morning where members examined whether four party TDs were in breach of ethics legislation following a complaint from Fine Gael TD Noel Rock.The controversy first emerged when Mr Collins voted six times for his colleague Mr Dooley while he was absent from the chamber during the weekly bloc voting session last month.It then emerged that the party’s Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers mistakenly sat in her colleague and party deputy leader Dara Calleary’s seat for one vote before moving to her own seat for the same vote.It is understood Ms Chambers will be issued with a warning. A report with a recommendation on the warning is likely to go to the Dáil next week.Mr Rock had filed a complaint to the head of the Members’ Interests Committee Hildegarde Naughten in relation to the three TDs as well as public expenditure spokesman Barry Cowen. It is understood the complaint abour Mr Cowen will be dismissed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4113083.1576154141!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk election 2019 voting under way in most important british election in a generation","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK Prime Minster Boris Johnson leaves the polling station after casting his vote.

Drax imports much of its wood from as far as North Carolina, while coal is available on its doorstep.\u0026nbspCapturing the carbon released when biomass is burnt\u0026nbspalso has its problems, said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner for Biofuelwatch. “Drax has been talking about carbon capture for a long time. But it’s not proven that this technology can work at scale when combined with biomass.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDrax currently removes around one ton\u0026nbspof CO2 per day but plans to scale this up to 16 million tons a year.One of the largest carbon-capture projects in the world, Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan, uses 31 per cent of all the energy it produces to collect CO2 and store it.UK will get by far its biggest carbon capture plant in 2021Ms\u0026nbspErnsting said that burning imported wood pellets by Drax was already pretty inefficient and it would become even less so if you add carbon capture, meaning you have to cut down and burn a lot of trees.”“If you increase logging that is not good for the climate. It is completely unsustainable.”\u0026nbspRaffaella Ocone, professor of chemical engineering at Heriot-Watt University, has also questioned whether carbon capture could be scaled up quickly and effectively.“I welcome that something is being done because we are in an emergency,” said Professor Ocone. “But it is unclear how long they would need before they can operate at full capture capacity and utilise the CO2 captured.”She pointed out a further potential environmental problem being\u0026nbspthe solvent chemicals\u0026nbspused to separate CO2 from other gases and allowing it to be stored. Many of these chemicals are corrosive and can cause environmental damage, but Drax says\u0026nbspits solvent is safer than those used in other\u0026nbspprojects and it is trialling methods that do not use solvents.Drax also needs more government subsidies after existing ones run out in 2027.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

Drax imports much of its wood from as far as North Carolina, while coal is available on its doorstep.\u0026nbspCapturing the carbon released when biomass is burnt\u0026nbspalso has its problems, said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner for Biofuelwatch. “Drax has been talking about carbon capture for a long time. But it’s not proven that this technology can work at scale when combined with biomass.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDrax currently removes around one ton\u0026nbspof CO2 per day but plans to scale this up to 16 million tons a year.One of the largest carbon-capture projects in the world, Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan, uses 31 per cent of all the energy it produces to collect CO2 and store it.UK will get by far its biggest carbon capture plant in 2021Ms\u0026nbspErnsting said that burning imported wood pellets by Drax was already pretty inefficient and it would become even less so if you add carbon capture, meaning you have to cut down and burn a lot of trees.”“If you increase logging that is not good for the climate. It is completely unsustainable.”\u0026nbspRaffaella Ocone, professor of chemical engineering at Heriot-Watt University, has also questioned whether carbon capture could be scaled up quickly and effectively.“I welcome that something is being done because we are in an emergency,” said Professor Ocone. “But it is unclear how long they would need before they can operate at full capture capacity and utilise the CO2 captured.”She pointed out a further potential environmental problem being\u0026nbspthe solvent chemicals\u0026nbspused to separate CO2 from other gases and allowing it to be stored. Many of these chemicals are corrosive and can cause environmental damage, but Drax says\u0026nbspits solvent is safer than those used in other\u0026nbspprojects and it is trialling methods that do not use solvents.Drax also needs more government subsidies after existing ones run out in 2027.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

should be going to genuinely zero-carbon energy,” said Ms Ernsting.Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said governments and businesses had a very poor record so far on making biomass work for large-scale energy production.“Decades of inaction by heavy polluters, such as Drax, has left us in a state where more drastic action is needed to tackle the nature emergency as well as the climate emergency,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Carbon capture with biomass remains speculative and cannot be used as an excuse to carry on with business as usual.\u0026nbsp“Any action to remove carbon from the

In 2015 David Cameron’s absolute majority was 12, the difference between the number of Conservative seats, 331, and all other parties, 319, in a House of Commons of 650. But because there were then five Sinn Fein MPs who didn’t take their seats, Cameron had a working majority of 17 (331 to 314).The working majority matters to a government trying to get its laws through parliament. So Boris Johnson needs to gain just four seats to gain a working majority of one (if Sinn Fein still has seven seats). The Conservatives had 318 seats at the last election, including the speaker (Buckingham originally being a Conservative seat and counting as one this time), so four net gains would give them 322, as against 321 for all the other parties.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A guide to party manifestos in the UK electionTinder encourages users to register to vote in general electionThe list was released\u0026nbspas the deadline passed to register to vote in the general election, with the group urging people who have secured their vote in the past few weeks to make sure they use it on 12 December.Even before what is believed to have been a massive last-minute rush of applications on the final day, applications to register have broken all records, with more than 2 million made by younger voters who are disproportionately in favour of the UK remaining in the European Union.In all, some 3,850,860 people applied between the election being called on 29 October and the registration deadline at midnight on Tuesday, with a record\u0026nbsp659,666 filing applications on the final day.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailBut as many as 1.2 million of the applications are likely to be duplicate entries by people already on the electoral roll, meaning that millions more will miss out on their chance to vote on 12 December.The Electoral Commission has estimated that up to 9.4 million people were not registered, or were recorded at an old address.The Vote for a Final Say group includes former personnel from the People’s Vote campaign, which was thrown into disarray after the dismissal of senior officials prompted a walkout by staff.The group is working with\u0026nbspyoung activists from For our Future’s Sake, a campaign to ensure that the voice of young people\u0026nbspis heard in the battle for a public vote.Former director of People’s Vote James McGrory, now a senior adviser to Vote for a Final Say, said: “Time is running out to stop Boris Johnson getting a landslide. There have been too many arguments about who has the best tactical voting website or polling data and not enough action.“We can all agree that these 25 seats are critical if we’re to prevent Brextremist Tories securing total power. Now is the time for everyone to roll their sleeves up and start fighting back.”As well as recommending votes for Lib Dem candidates in seven target seats, the group urges voters in\u0026nbspOchil and South Perthshire to back the Scottish National Party’s John Nicolson. He is hoping to overturn a Conservative majority of 3,359 votes.But the other 17 are Labour-held seats where Jeremy Corbyn’s party is attempting to fight off a challenge from the Conservatives.In a reflection of Labour’s struggle to make a dent in the Tory lead in the polls, they do not even include its most marginal constituencies like Kensington, Dudley North and Newcastle-under-Lyme, suggesting that anti-Brexit campaigners fear Mr Johnson is set to sweep up a number of gains from Mr Corbyn’s party.Mr Johnson would have to improve by nine on the tally of 317 seats won by Theresa May in 2017 to hit the magic number of 326 guaranteeing him an overall majority in the House of Commons.Labour seats on the Vote for a Final Say list include some of the so-called Workington Man\u0026nbspseats in the north of England and midlands, where Tories are hoping to win over working-class Leave supporters, such as Wakefield, Warrington South and Sedgefield. The latter is Tony Blair’s old seat where strongly anti-Brexit Labour MP Phil Wilson is defending a 14.6 per cent majority.Others include Birmingham Northfield, Bristol North West, Bury North, Canterbury, Cardiff North, Croydon Central, Eltham, Enfield Southgate, Gower, Portsmouth South, Reading East, Warwick and Leamington, Weaver Vale and Wirral West.In Canterbury, where Ms Swinson controversially overruled local activists who wanted to stand aside in favour of Labour’s pro-EU Rosie Duffield, the campaign advises Remain supporters to shun the Lib Dem candidate and back Ms Duffield.Vote for a Final Say has raised thousands of pounds to advertise tactical voting advice in these seats.This will be targeted particularly at young people, working class women and ethnic minorities, who the campaign believes are among the groups which are generally least likely to participate in elections but can be mobilised when it becomes clear that the stakes are so high.\u0026nbspAmanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, the co-founder of youth referendum campaign For our Future’s Sake, said: “More than a million young people have registered to vote in this generation-defining election over the last few days. Now we must make sure people use those votes – and use them wisely.“These 25 seats could decide whether Boris Johnson gets the majority he needs to do whatever he wants of us having the chance to stop him through a Final Say referendum. Young people are traditionally the group of voters least likely take part in elections but we also have the most to lose. In constituencies where just a few hundred people could make all the difference, it is vital we make our voices heard.”Analysis of applications to register to vote conducted by the Electoral Reform Society found that the 3,191,193 entries by midnight on Monday equates to 114,000 per day and was 38 per cent higher than in the same period before the 2017 election, when 68,000 a day put their names forward.Of this year’s applications so far, 2,125,064\u0026nbspapplications (67 per cent of the total) were made by people aged 34 or under.The complete list of 25 constituencies, with the recommended candidate for pro-Remain voters, is as follows:\u0026nbspOchil and South Perthshire, John Nicolson (SNP)A so-called “youthquake” in 2017 saw a higher proportion of young people than usual take part in the general election, and was credited by some for Labour’s unexpectedly strong performance.And as the cut-off for registration grew closer, an even greater proportion of young people registered. On Tuesday, 459,668 people aged 34 or under filed applications to vote - accounting for 70 per cent of those who applied on the last day before the deadline.Dr Jess Garland, director of policy and research at the Electoral Reform Society, said: “This surge in registrations is highly encouraging, given the huge numbers missing from the electoral roll. We’re seeing a major uplift in new registrations compared to the last election, with large numbers of young people signing up too – a traditionally under-registered demographic.\u0026nbsp“It’s vital we close the demographic ides in terms of who is registered. This is a strong start.”She added: “However, since you cannot check whether you’re registered already, we estimate over a million of the registrations we’ve seen are likely to be duplicates. We urgently need to update our archaic registration system to bring in the ‘missing millions’.”The Electoral Reform Society is calling for a “registration revolution”, in which citizens are automatically registered to vote so applying is no longer necessary.Vote for a Final Say\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Nigel Farage\u0027s Brexit Party has been squeezed to just 2 per cent, with the Greens on 3 per cent.If the prediction is accurate, the Tories would win the largest share of the vote at an election since Margaret Thatcher\u0027s first victory in 1979.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut nearly a quarter of voters (23 per cent) said they could still change their mind before marking their cross on the ballot paper, an increase from 19 per cent in\u0026nbspin 2017, the survey for the Evening Standard found.This rises to 41 per cent\u0026nbspof Liberal Democrat supporters, while Labour supporters are\u0026nbspmore likely to wobble\u0026nbspthan Conservatives - by 25 per cent to 17 per cent.What time will key seats declare their results?While the Tories maintain a 11-point lead, the\u0026nbspvolatility of the electorate and potential\u0026nbspmargins of error in polls leave Mr Johnson facing the prospect of an\u0026nbspindecisive outcome in the early hours of Friday morning.Gideon Skinner, head of political research at the company, said there was potential for more switching as voters head to the polls.Labour has squeezed the Liberal Democrat vote share over the course of the campaign, but our final poll suggests this has not been enough to prevent the Conservatives scenting victory, he said.Overall, the Conservatives have managed to keep their vote from 2017 more successfully than Labour, while Boris Johnson retains his lead over Jeremy Corbyn as the most preferred PM.\u0026nbspThe country is not unanimous though, with clear splits by age as well as by other groups, and the number of people who said they might still change their mind is slightly higher than in 2017, with potential for more switching between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Haskell was big enough to pacy Wrighty, the series’ one real character, and Jenner was a waste of £, as she had everyone treading on PC eggshells and queuing up to assure us she was “an amazing, amazing woman”.Most of the rest were merely present and it was hard to have an opinion about almost any of them. Especially Adele, who had a picture of Jane McDonald rather than a personality, and Oddboddish Myles, who seemed to be using “the experience of a letime” to get his own cookery show. Not the reason most people would go in there.But a lot of this year’s contestants were young, tearful, mollycoddled, over-entitled, insecure products of our woke times and were treated accordingly by the production team, who bombarded the poor homesick little lambs with fry-ups, roast dinners, care packages, letters from home and so much food, most of them left the camp sounding like they’d just spent a fortnight at The Palms in Vegas.Roman: “That was the best thing I’ve ever done in my le.”Andy: “I loved every single minute of it.” Myles: “It’s been the most beautul time of my le.”Which was lovely for them but dull as hell for us, no matter how much they banged on about the “emotional rollercoaster ride” and missing their ruddy kids.Nor did it help Ant  Dec, who tried their brilliant best to inject laughter and running gags into the show. This, though, was one series of I’m A Celeb not even they could save.On Sunday it ended, appropriately enough, with victory for Jacqueline Jossa, who probably hoovered up the “Gloria Gaynor” block vote on account of her husband Dan Osborne’s off-screen shenanigans, which were far more interesting than anything that happened on screen.If this flat, tearful, commercially driven series got the winner it deserved, it certainly didn’t get the right epitaph from Ant.“One thing’s for sure,” he claimed confidently at the end, “We’ll never forget the class of .”And with that, I’d forgotten them.A FEW points to make regarding the BBC continuity announcer’s plug for Gemma Collins’ podcast, which kicked in during The Apprentice: You’re Fired credits.“I’ve got a great podcast to tell you about.” You haven’t.“It’s so entertaining.” It’s not.“Was Gemma Collins an elephant in a past le ” PAST FEELGOOD television story of the week Nish Kumar getting booed off stage at the Lord’s Taverners charity dinner. Proof he really hasn’t been paying attention to his Mash Report audience.If he had, Nish would’ve noticed they’re not laughing, they’re applauding in furious agreement about just how much they also hate the Tories, Boris, Trump and Brexit.Those of us who don’t share any of these left-wing prejudices, of course, are just meant to sit and meekly accept the abuse and the fact that all the least funny, most obnoxious and radioactively smug people on TV suddenly seem to have decided they’re the nation’s new moral compass and we’re racist bigots.What’s brilliant about the Lord’s Taverners story and accompanying internet footage of the audience is they refuse to play ball. At the point the clip kicks in, Nish has already lost them and is, as always, playing the race card.Half the crowd are booing, the other half are begging him to say something funny, ashe might suddenly turn into Robin Williams.A great comedian could still have turned it round and adjusted their material, of course.But Nish Kumar is neither great nor even a comedian. He’s a left-wing propagandist who cannotoutside of the tiny BBC Channel  echo chamber, so he has to be ushered off stage by the tombola bloke in red livery.It could’ve happened to any one of a number of C BBC “comedians”, obviously. The Tez O’Clock Show, The Last Leg, Have I Got News For You and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order are all just as biased and unpleasant as The Mash Report.Nish is by far the smuggest offender, though, andthe BBC is ever going to make a mass audience laugh again, instead of just lecturing us, it needs to learn the Lord’s Taverners lesson and carve these words on a comedy gravestone: “Ladies and gentlemen, Nish Kumar. It’s time for us to draw the raffle.”THE title of ITV’s It’s Not The Robbie Williams Christmas Show was loaded with all sorts of obvious threats.He would sing and smirk and then sing some more.But even I wasn’t prepared for the ego, which I blame fairly and squarely on his we Ayda Field who, Robbie claimed: “Gave me the gt of loving myself.”And certainly didn’t need to keep the receipt.The comedy segments were another endurance, featuring his dad, Jamie Cullum, Ant  Dec and David Walliams, who’d dressed up as an obsessive female fan, but was nothing like as terrying as the real thing, Julie from Norfolk, who Robbie winched out of the audience for a burst of Something Stupid. Then instantly regretted it.His own fault. Robbie suggested, “Do whatever you want”, and she took him at his word.To the audible shock of the crowd, Julie was over him, under him, round him and very nearly up him. And hell knows where it would’ve endedRobbie hadn’t drawn things to a close with the instruction: “Take a bow, Julie.”Then take a sedative, take a cold shower and take your head out of his fundament.

A decent majority will liberate him to secure Brexit by January .But Boris also has a zeal to radically improve Sun readers’ lives — and we would hold him to it.His rival for PM, Marxist Jeremy Corbyn, was yesterday branded a danger to national security by one of his OWN senior front-benchers, shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth. A Boris victory would kill off that threat for ever.He would then be able to pour £billion extra into the NHS, hire , more cops to hammer crime, inject substantial new funding into schools and green-light multi-billion-pound, job-creating infrastructure projects.Plus, Boris will not raise income tax, National Insurance or VAT for five years.No sane politician can or should compete with the absurd freebies Corbyn claims he could dole out. Labour’s entire plan is a vast, ruinous fantasy, relying solely on the better-off sticking around to be hammered again and again for extra tax. The truth is everyone would pay for Marxist revolution.Boris, by contrast, would not bankrupt Britain. Nor wage war on private companies, as Corbyn would, and scare off investors, causing mass job losses.And, crucially, he tends to achieve what he sets out to. He ran for Mayor in Labour-dominated London and won twice. He led the Leave campaign to victory against the Remainer establishment. He was written off as a futureTory leader but won that too. He doggedly pursued, and won, the new Brexit deal every know-all said was impossible.Boris is being subjected to a tsunami of hate from Corbyn’s thugs and diehard Remainers who know he is Brexit’s last hope. Almost all of it is confected cobblers. Boris is as liberal as any of them.He is nothing like their hard-right caricature and they know it. Had he backed Remain they would love him.Boris is the right man to lead Britain into the s. And the alternative, as Corbyn’s own front-benchers privately admit, is too horric to think about.Vote Tory tomorrow.HEARING Corbyn branded a national security risk by one of his most senior frontbenchers is almost too much to grasp.Jon Ashworth, shadow health secretary, believes that his own leader is a danger to Britain. ThatCorbyn becomes PM on Friday the civil service will need to act rapidly to keep us all safe.The Sun has long considered Corbyn an unprecedented threat to our country. He is far closer to terrorists like Hamas than our No ally, America, which he detests. Our security partners would not trust him with classied information.But this taped confession tells us much about those around him too.In public Ashworth is a loyal Corbynista. In private he says Corbyn is a security threat and a loser who blocked Brexit. He longs to replace him with someone “half-decent”.He and his allies know their leader to be useless. Worse, they are beseeching voters to hand power to an extremist they know endangers every one of us.How can they look themselves in the mirror Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If youre stuck in the queue as polls shut, dont worry, youll still be able to vote.All you have to do is pick your favourite candidate, and put an X next to them on the paper.Polling stations have all sorts of odd rules, including not letting your kids vote for you.They can come into the station, but  you have to be the one to make the X on the paper.If you mark more than one box, your paper will be invalid.Once you are ready, fold the paper and put it in the box where votes are collected.You can use any of your pens, but pencils are advised. Instagram influencers will have to keep their snaps to themselves, atleast inside the polling station - the Electoral Commission warns against selfies in case it reveals how someone voted, which is against the law.The punishment for revealing someone s vote, even accidentally, is up to £ or six months in jail.Any pictures outside the polling booth are perfectly fine.Cats, horses, and any other pets, bar assistance dogs, will have to wait outside or at home.The polls are incredibly close, and as with the last two elections, not entirely trustworthy.While recent polls have Boris Johnson in the lead, polling expert Sir John Curtice has warned it is far from in the bag.Last nights YouGov MRP poll, which was the only one to predict Theresa Mays hung parliament, gave the Conservatives a  seat majority with a total of  seats.That is down from  from the last MRP poll at the end of last month.The poll also has Labour on  seats, down  from , the Lib Dems on  seats and the SNP on .It really is all up in the air, and polls throughout the election campaign have cast a Tory lead anywhere between  and  points.All this is by way of saying, every vote matters, there is no such thing as certainty until all the ballots are finally counted.A winter election means chilly temperatures.Parts of northern England and Scotland could see a white election day, after the Met Office warned of snow in parts of the UK.Elsewhere temperatures will be ranging from a frosty  degrees in the South East to  degrees in Northern England and Scotland.Parts of Northern Ireland and Wales will need to bring their umbrellas and raincoatsthey want to stay dry on election day, rain will move over the London, and the rest of England as the day wears on.The area around Southampton, Itchen - one of the most marginal constituencies -  is looking at downpours with between  and  mm of rain."},{"url":null,"title":"polls reveal 26 seats boris could nick off corbyn","story":"The survey, released last night, shows that your vote could remove nine shadow ministers who would have a position in a Labour government.Polling firm YouGov interviewed over , people between December  and December , and while their results show that the PM is on course for a -seat majority, it leaves a hung Parliament within the data’s margin for error.Last month, the same model predicted Boris would get a -seat majority.

By not supporting Jeremy Corbyn and his Communist buddies, I am - I am told - an “age traitor”. Boris is for boomers, the thinking goes, and Corbyn is for us.But scratch the surface and you’ll find that the Prime Minister - a man who made his name as mayor of London - has rather a lot to offer us young folk. And Jeremy Corbyn - a Marxist straight from the s- might just make  our lives a hell of a lot worse.Take, for example, the issue the vast majority of young people say matters to them most: housing.If you’re a young private renter, Corbyn’s radical plan to crackdown on “dodgy” landlords sounds really rather good.But there’s a serious catch. If landlords could be forced by the government to sell their homes to tenants at a price dictated by the Government, the buy-to-let market would collapse. And fast.In a few pockets of the country, where housing supply is plentul, that would be great. With landlords out of the picture, those desperate to get on the property ladder might stand a chance.In most of Britain, though, the picture wouldn’t be so rosy. Where available housing is precious and most people can’t afford to get on the housing ladderprivate renting is a blessing. And a collapse in the buy-to-let market would hike the price of it.So under Corbyn’s “fairer Britain”, those right at the start of their careers would soon be priced out of metropolitan areas.Then take university fees. Again, the idea of “free uni” sounds very tempting indeed. But under Corbyn’s regime, university tuition wouldn’t suddenly become free. It would just be paid for by the tax-payer instead of the student.What does that mean in practice  Well, it means that the  per cent of young people who opt to get a job end up at  would end up massively subsidising the  per cent who choose to enjoy three years of student le. I loved my time at uni, but I don’t see why my  year old cousin - who’s been working his socks off in the navy for three years - should be forced to pay for it.And evenyou are a student or planning to go to university, Corbyn won’t help you in any real sense. If students don’t contribute to their own education, universities suddenly have a lot less money. Which means they can’t admit as many teenagers.In Scotland, for example, where tuition has been “free” for years, fewer and fewer young people are going to university. And because the middle classes know how to game the system, it tends to be disadvantaged kids who get let down.Andyou work for yourself, which around % of Generation Z would like to do, Labour’s radical tax plan certainly isn’t for you.Even though Jeremy Corbyn has promised that only the richest five per cent of workers will face higher bills, new analysis shows that self-employed workers earning much less could be £, a year worse off under the new rules. And sole traders - ie. young, ambitious entrepreneurs who pay themselves lower salaries in order to invest in their businesses - would suffer the most.Boris Johnson might not be a hit at Glastonbury. But like a true One Nation Conservative, he believes in opportunity. And his pragmatic schemes, like % deposit mortgages, would give hard working young people a proper leg up in le.I don’t hunt, I don’t shoot, and I wouldn’t be seen dead in tweed. But I believe that a country can only succeed when ambitious young people are encouraged by the state to spread their wings and fly. Not given countless handouts by a bankrupt Government.So tomorrow, I’ll be voting Conservative with pride.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it has NEVER been more important. The stakes have never been this high.You can back Boris Johnson — who makes a direct plea to Sun readers — to secure Brexit by January  and steer us into a bright new decade as a prosperous and independent nation outside the EU.If you don’t, oryou stay at home, you risk handing power to Jeremy Corbyn’s extremists, who will reverse Brexit andus to the industrial carnage of the bleak s which his union paymasters consider a golden age.Back in  The Sun’s famous “lightbulb” front pagewarned of the nightmare of a Neil Kinnock Labour Government.That would have been a picnic compared with a Corbyn regime which threatens to drag our great country into a terrying and dark new era.Imagine you wake tomorrow to find Jeremy Corbyn, even in defeat, somehow cobbling together a Government in which the Scottish Nationalists and Lib Dems call the shots.Imagine this appalling Remainer pact drafting a new, rigged Brexit referendum and another hideously isive Scottish independence vote.Imagine them radically altering the voting rules to ensure hard-Left power for a generation.Imagine that the Pound has already crashed, hundreds of billions are being pulled out of the country and our global allies are making contingency plans to freeze out our new Marxist Prime Minister, considered a national security risk not just by them but by his own health secretary.This is not some scare story The Sun has invented. It is inevitableBoris Johnson has agonisingly too few seats for a working majority.As the economy begins its rapid descent into ruin, with the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs — maybe including yours — imagine how you will feelyou didn’t go out and vote to prevent it.The Sun has warned for years how dangerous Corbyn, his creepy shadow chancellor John McDonnell and their Communist aides are.We highlighted how they backed the IRA while it was executing our soldiers and civilians. How Corbyn considers Arab terrorists “friends” while loathing the West and our No ally America in particular.We told how his anti-Semitism had drawn Jew-hating bigots to his party like flies to a cesspit and led to Labour becoming only the second party after the fascist BNP to be probed for racism by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.We described how he and McDonnell revel in left-wing thuggery and foster a vicious hatred of opponents, exemplied by their repulsive social media trolls and the flashmobs that publicly vily and intimidate Tories.They have created a party of hypocrites and liars for whom no fabrication is too bigit damages the Tories they detest. A party which built an election campaign around a monstrous hood about the Tories “selling the NHS” to Trump.Corbyn was a joke once. Now, with this election as tight as it is, he is on the brink of power. It should terry every sane person in Britain. It is shocking that it does not. It is profoundly depressing to see people supposedly opposed to racism give Labour’s anti-Semitism a free pass asit is a “lesser” prejudice, even a socially acceptable one. Tell that to terried British Jews, resigned to emigrating to escape Corbyn. Or to the  former Labour MPs who yesterday begged the public not to vote for their old boss for precisely this reason.What has our country become that such a toxic, dangerous party could be within a mile of power  A party which derives its energy from grievance and hate  What has happened to our education system that the insane high-tax, business-destroying economics of Corbyn and McDonnell, which have brought ruin everywhere they have been applied, are discussed as a serious possibility  That despite mass starvation in Venezuela, which Corbyn held up as his model, his young fans still believe the same system is worth a go The answer is austerity and its successful weaponisation by a Labour Party relying on voters forgetting why it was necessary. Well, here’s a reminder: In  the global financial crisis and Labour’s scandalous over-spending left us heading for bankruptcy. Labour was borrowing nearly £billion a WEEK and left incoming Tories a snarky note: “Dear Chief Secretary. I’m afraid there is no money.”They thought it was FUNNY. The cost was nine long years of cuts, vital to get our finances back in order. These are now presented as a cruel Tory “choice”. That is nonsense. They had no alternative.But, yes, public services have struggled. The NHS is short-staffed and cannot keep pace with an older, sicker and rapidly expanding population. Police cuts have hurt the fight against crime.Homes are far too expensive for young people, particularly in the South. Many of those don’t recall Labour’s financial disaster. They just want change and an economic stake in society. But they and too many others who will vote Labour because they are sick of “Tory cuts” forget why they happened:Labour wrecked the economy. The Tories had to fix it.Boris is a dferent Tory, unafraid to spend big to pump le back into “left-behind” communities.His economic programme is far more lavish than that of Theresa May or David Cameron. He will plough billions more into the NHS, police, schools and new infrastructure projects. He has a zeal to regenerate regions that fell behind as London flourished. Mrs May talked about it. Boris will do it.And, yes, a Tory majority WILL deliver Brexit on January . But you are going to have to vote for it.Too many think they voted for Brexit once, it didn’t happen and they can’t be bothered voting any more. That all politicians are liars, so why trust any  Or that Nigel Farage has promised to deliver Brexit too, so you’ll vote for him.These would be disastrous errors.Farage’s party will not win seats. A vote for his Brexit Party is one lost to the Tories, as several Farage candidates have now admitted.Andyou’re a Remainer Tory who dislikes Boris, a vote for the Lib-Dems is not a “free hit”. It’s a vote for chaos, from which Corbyn is almost certain to emerge as PM.The stark reality is Britain cannot afford for Boris to fall short.Soyou are inclined to vote Tory you MUST go out today and do it.Boris has been in power only four months, hamstrung all along by a Remainer Parliament. He could be a great PM and deserves a chance.Go out and vote Tory today. Save Brexit, and save Britain from Corbyn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The choice facing you, the people of this country, tomorrow is truly historic.“The establishment doesn’t want Labour to win.” He added: “Tomorrow you can shock the establishment by voting for hope.Hope for yourself. Hope for your family. Hope for your community. Hope for our NHS. Hope for our country.”Mr Corbyn jubilantly declared “Labour is going to win the election” as he warned Boris Johnson to “look out”.On a -minute visit to Glasgow, Mr Corbyn blanked media amid a storm over his health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth trashing Labour’s chances in a leaked phone call. Instead Mr Corbyn declared class war on the wealthy.Slamming the Tories, he said: “Their’s is the party of billionaires, ours is the party of the many.“Tomorrow you can vote for despair and vote for the dishonesty of this government, or you can vote Labour and get a government that can bring hope to the future.”He then zipped down to Middlesbrough where shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald led the audience of around  Labour supporters in a festive singalong.The Corbynista frontbencher sang: “It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Johnson needs to go.“He’ll have to leave Number Ten, it’s time to get Labour in, they made a mess the Tories need to go.“It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas lots of ho ho ho. But the prettiest sight to see, will be Jeremy by the tree by No’s front door.”Labour’s party chairman Ian Lavery also boasted about their chances. Leaping to the stage, he yelled: “It’s within our grasp — we are only inches away from the winning line.”Brandishing the little red book containing their manesto, he said Labour will “transform society”.But Mr Corbyn had to pull out of two planned stops in Ashfield and Broxtowe as he ran out of time.New evidence of the cost of a Corbyn government emerged. Tory research discovered that Labour’s economic plans could send the cost of an average Christmas rocketing by a third.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell would like to implement a tax on food based on the number of air miles travelled. The nation’s favourite roast potatoes – maris pipers grown in Israel – would cost an extra p.A frozen stuffed Iceland Perfect Turkey Crown would cost another £. — as they come from Hungary. Sprouts, jetted in from South Africa, would cost £. extra.Christmas day costs the average family £ — butCorbyn wins, this could jump up another £.Meanwhile, Labour’s shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis has called for the government to give up trying to make Britain’s economy bigger.Mr Lewis has penned a chapter in Extinction Rebellion handbook This is not a Drill calling for ministers to “abandon the fetish of growth”. He is one of John McDonnell’s key deputies and would help run the economyLabour win.Tory ministers warned a Corbyn government would cost jobs, drive down wages, and ruin the economy.Treasury Minister Rishi Sunak said: “Don’t wake up on Friday the th to the nightmare of a Corbyn Sturgeon coalition.Corbyn’s plans wouldn’t just make your Christmas expensive, it would cost you an extra £, in taxes every year.”Treasury Minister Simon Clarke warned: “Corbyn’s Labour would wreck the economy and leave the country unable to pay for anything.”Last night Mr Corbyn prematurely declared victory in the social media election war.Labour said their videos notched up .million views on Facebook compared with m for the Tories.Mr Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell need to “hear first hand about the impact of terror on families”, the group said.It added Mr Corbyn was “not just a sympathiser of the IRA but a supporter”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It says “Friday th”. Then I hear a horrible cackling — and, OMG, it’s Diane Abbott standing by my bed, her face split open with mirth.“We’re in charge now!” she shrieks: “Ha ha ha ha ha.” And then the rest of the ghouls appear.Magic Grandpa Jeremy Corbyn, smirking through his beard, wearing his Lenin hat. Jo Swinson of the Lib Dems like a Girl Guide Leader from Hades. And then — grinning like Janette Krankie on acid — Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP.I try to hide under the covers but Diane pulls them back. “We’re in charge now,” she repeats. “And first we’re going to wreck Brexit. And then we’re going to wreck the country. Ha ha ha ha.”Friday, December  is the day we find out who will be ruling us for the next five years. And my nightmare could quite possibly come true.I’ve been saying for ages that the idiotic Corbyn could win this election — without actually winning any more seats.It is an incredibly precarious position for Boris Johnson and the Conservatives — and thus for Brexit.The polls seem to be tightening. The Conservatives haven’t run a terribly good campaign, it’s true.All it needs is another drop in the Tory lead of one per cent and we would be heading for a hung Parliament.That almost certainly means a government led by Corbyn, with support from the Lib Dems and the SNP. It would definitely mean an end for Brexit.The democratic decision we took three years ago would be forgotten. At best there would be ANOTHER referendum.Almost certainly rigged by Labour and the Lib Dems to ensure that, this time, the right side won, ie, their side.They have no respect whatsoever for that democratic mandate. They are very clear about that. But there will be even worse to come.Labour will usher in a ruinous economic programme which the country cannot possibly afford.Our entrepreneurs will flee the country. We’ll be back in huge debt once again. Spending on stuff we cannot afford.Labour plans to spend TWENTY EIGHT times as much money as the ConservativesWorst of all, we will be led by a halfwit who supports every enemy known to this country.You name a terrorist cell or a vile, authoritarian country and mad old Jezza will at some point have offered it support.From the IRA to the genocidal Islamists Hamas, from Cuba to Iran.The brilliant website Guido Fawkes has detailed all the times Corbyn has stuck up for terrorists or horrible totalitarian governments. Gawd help us, the list is almost endless.This is a bloke who has said he wishes Nato didn’t exist. That’s the military alliance which has kept peace for  years!But don’t take my word for it. Just this week yet another Labour MP was caught moaning about how truly bloody awful Corbyn was.Jonathan Ashworth said voters were turned off by the man and that the prospects for Labour were “dire”.He added: “I’m helping colleagues, banging on about the NHS for them, but it’s awful for them, and it’s the combination of Corbyn and Brexit . . . outside of the city seats . . . it’s abysmal out there . . . they can’t stand Corbyn and they think Labour’s blocked Brexit.”That’s not “Tory lies”, as the lefties always say when someone takes a pop at the old scrote.That’s a member of his own front-bench team. But then a good two thirds of Labour MPs can’t stand Corbyn and think he would be awful for this country.As Boris Johnson said, Ashworth was only saying what hundreds of Labour candidates and millions of voters were thinking.You wonder why some of those candidates don’t have the courage of their convictions and stand down.In fact, plenty have already done so. Ivan Lewis, for example, who has urged everybody to vote Conservative.Then there was John Woodcock and Ian Austin. Both former Labour MPs, moderates. They even made placards telling people to vote Tory.More MPs left Labour long ago — such as Chuka Umunna, who is now standing as a Liberal Democrat, and Brexiteer Kate Hoey can’t bring herself to support the party she served for  years.The man and his retinue of Trots — John McDonnell, Rebecca Long-Bailey , the ghastly Diane Abbott — are a laughing stock. Except I don’t find very much to laugh about, to tell you the truth.And along with Labour and the Lib Dems will come more stupid, socially isive identity politics. The whole country ided up into competing victimhoods.Gay, transgender, black, Asian. Asthese were the things which define us as human beings.But then that’s the infantile and damaging way the Left sees the world.Given all this, you might think it incredible that Corbyn could ever get the keys to No Downing Street. So many people despise the bloke.And that’s before we factor in his repellent anti-Semitism .And you might look at the polls and think — well, the Tories still have a decent lead. Nothing much to worry about.It won’t be Friday th or Nightmare On Abbott Street. It might well be Groundhog Day, but that’s preferable. But this is the big problem for BoJo and his Conservative team. Complacency. The suspicion on the part of the electorate that Corbyn could never actually win. When he could win all too easily — and don’t forget, the opinion polls are very often wrong.The other problem for the Tories is, of course, the Brexit Party. They are still fielding candidates in seats up and down the country — seats which the Tories need to win in order to form a government.Some senior figures in the Brexit Party have already said they would be far better off backing the Tories in order to get Brexit done.But Brexit Party boss Nigel Farage will not listen to them.So we have the terrible situation where people might vote for the Brexit Party in order to make sure we leave the European Union — but in doing so actually STOP Brexit from occurring.Becausethe Brexit Party takes lots of votes from the Tories, that lets in Labour and the Lib Dems through the back door. And the result  No Brexit.It’s in those seats in the North and Midlands where the Conservatives are most vulnerable to a high Brexit Party vote.This is a crucial election. Not just for Brexit, but for Britain’s future.That means a vote for the Conservatives, no matter how much that sticks in the craw.I’ve mentioned before that the only time I voted Tory I felt pretty glum afterwards.But this time there really is no alternative except in a tiny handful of seats where the Tories cannot possibly win.Once this election is out of the way, we need a new party to provide opposition to the Tories.A party that will replace Labour. For me, that’s the Social Democrats. But we’re not at that stage yet.For now it’s a case of walking to the polling booth, holding your nose and voting Blue.You decide our government. You may have your doubts about our democracy — I don’t blame you! You may feel uneasy voting Tory — don’t blame you for that, either.But you hold the destiny of our country in your hands.Indeed, when you put that cross in a box, you ARE the government. The person who decides what is best for our country.So make your vote count, please — and banish those nightmares for ever. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Election officials in my district agreed.Elsewhere in the capital voters struggled to access their polling station after a water mains burst in Bermondsey this morning - but still managed to cast their vote.Tim Bale, Professor of Politics at the Queen Mary University, said theof the lines didnt necessarily help either of the main parties.It depends whos in the queues, he said.In London weve seen in the past that a higher turnout in some constituencies will increase an already Labour majority, but not necessarily switch it.Professor Bale said the vote could go either way in the event of a high turnout but that it could help Labour and the Remain said.He added: Having said that,there are lots of people are motivated to vote who might not normally vote, it could be a good sign for Leave, like in the Brexit referendum.The third General Election in less than five years has been largely dominated by the  vote to leave the European Union - with Labour pledging to give voters another say in a second referendum, while the Tories have vowed to take the UK out of the EU next month.The last election in the UK in  saw a . per cent turnout, higher than at at the  and  elections - with bookies offering - odds on a - per cent turnout this year.In a final plea to voters on the eve of polling day, Mr Johnson warned that the election remained on a kne edge, but said it represented a chance to end the gridlock.A poll by The Dailyand Savanta ComRes, published last night, placed the Tories five points ahead of Mr Corbyns party - indicating the potential for a Conservative majority or a hung parliament.But a separate poll by Kantar put the Tories on %, Labour on % and the Liberal Democrats on %.Prime Minister Mr Johnson, who gambled his premiership by triggering the vote, has sought to focus on his pledge to get Brexit done throughout the campaign.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, his rival in the race to Number , has instead tried to highlight his partys credentials on the health service and other domestic issues.Mr Johnson arrived at Central Methodist Hall in Westminster at around .am to cast his vote, his dog Dilyn by his side.Mr Corbyn, SNPs Nichola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson were also seen entering their respective polling stations.The polls have narrowed in the final week of what has largely been a tame campaign - with few gaffes and many stage-managed visits.On Monday Mr Johnson came under fire when he pocketed a journalists phone when asked to view a photograph of a four-year-old boy who was forced to sleep on a hospital floor.The following day, however, Labours campaign was rocked when a member of the shadow cabinet was revealed to have poured scorn on Mr Corbyns election chances in a leaked recording.A terror attack on London Bridge - which echoed a similar incident in the middle of the  election - briefly disrupted the campaign, but quickly turned political as the Tories and Labour exchanged blows over how to deal with such threats.Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson said the polls showed it was still absolutely possible to deny the Tories an overall majority through tactical voting.We know from past elections that, very often, voters who vote tactically come to that conclusion in the final hours before they cast their vote, she said.Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, speaking in Doncaster, said he was hoping for very, very heavy rain in the town on Thursday, in the belief that it would depress the votes of the other parties.I know that people who are going to vote for us will turn out, because they absolutely believe in our message, they believe in their hearts as well as in their heads, he said.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

dropped off the radar screens of flight monitors in Malaysia just five seconds after it crossed into Vietnamese airspace.But the controller monitoring its progress in Kuala Lumpur was dealing with other traffic on his screen and didn’t notice it had vanished.Its been reported by the Atlantic that when he finally did, he assumed that it was now in the hands of his counterparts in Ho Chi Minh.However, Vietnamese controllers saw the Boeing  - which vanished with  on board - cross into their airspace and then also disappear.They then apparently misunderstood rules which meant they were supposed to inform Malaysia immediatelya plane did not show up.They tried repeatedly to contact the flight crww of the aircraft - which is believed to have crashed into the ocean - but to no avail.By the time they finally picked up the phone to inform Kuala Lumpur,  minutes had passed since its sudden disappearance.What ensued was an exercise in confusion and incompetence full of blunders, say those close to the long-running investigationKuala Lumpur’s Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre should have been notied within an hour of the disappearance, they say.Malaysia Airlines Flight MH took off from Kuala Lumpur and was heading to Beijing with  people on board.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at .am on March , , Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH close to Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around , miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate.However, it eventually took more than four hours to alert rescuers - which means it is virtually impossible to pinpoint where and when it went down.Five pieces, thought to be from the Malaysia Airlines plane, later washed up in Madagascar - more than , miles from Vietnam.Aviation expert Victor Iannello believes one fragment, which appears to be from the interior floorboard, is consistent with a “high-speed impact.More than  bits of aircraft debris have so far been collected from ious places around the world over the past five years.However, only three wing fragments that washed up along the Indian Ocean have been confirmed to be from the missing flight.Its been reported earlier this year that the pilot was in control until the very end but made abnormal turns before crashing.French investigators have been given access to a considerable amount of flight data sent during the flight prior to the crash.Official documents lend weight to fears pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, , crashed into the sea in a murder-suicide, they were cited as saying.Some feared Russian president Vladimir Putin was involved in the hijacking of MH.US Science writer Jeff Wise claimed Putin spoofed the planes navigation data so it could fly unnoticed into Baikonur Cosmodrome so he could hurt the West.French ex-airline director Marc Dugain accused the US military of shooting down the plane because they feared it had been hijacked.Malaysia police chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar suggested the disappearance could have been the result of a suicide.He claimed someone on board could have taken out a large le insurance package before getting on the plane, so they could treat their family or pay back the money they owed.Historian and writer Norman Davies suggested MH could have been remotely hacked and flown to a secret location as a result of sensitive material being carried aboard the jet.Malaysia Airlines found a -inch crack in the fuselage of one of its planes, days before MH disappeared.The Federal Aviation Administration insists it issued a final warning two days before the disappearance.But the Daily Mirror claimed the missing jet did not have the same antenna as the rest of the Boeing s so it did not receive the warning.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull unexpectedly said it was “very likely that the captain planned this shocking event”.He claimed the pilot wanted to create the worlds greatest mystery.Another theory claimed that he hijacked his own plane in protest of the jailing of then-Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and as a way to destabilise the corrupt government of Najib Razak.Another seemingly far-fetched idea said the pilot had deliberately crashed the plane to cover his track as he had parachuted out of the plane so he could spend the rest of his le with his girlfriend who was waiting in a boat in the sea.In the wake of the incident, South Korea noted that North Korea nearly took out a Chinese plane which had  passengers on board, on March , .Some fear Pyongyang shot the plane down, but others believe it was hijacked and erted into the communist nation.One theory claims that because many relatives were able to hear a ringing tone for up to four days after the crash so the doomed jet could not have smashed into the Indian Ocean.Nineteen families have all claimed the devices of their loved ones rang for up to four days after the jet went missing.However, wireless analysts claim that phone firms sometimes use a phantom ringing sound when the device is not active, the Daily Star reports.In September , British video producer Ian Wilson claimed to have found the missing aircraft using Google Maps.Despite millions being spent on the search to located the wreckage, the Brit sleuth believes he has found the jet in a mountainous area of the Cambodian jungle.In response, the Chinese government used observation company Space View to focus in on the high-altitude area on the outskirts of Phnom Penh.However, the firm claim there was no sign of any plane, least of all the Malaysian Airlines aircraft which has been missing since March .An MH sleuth has claimed that locals in Cambodia told him they saw a plane believed to be the doomed Malaysia Airlines flight crashing in the jungle.If the jet was flying north then possible locations could stretch as fast as the border between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to Thailand.The Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak originally asked the Kazakhstan leader Nursultan Nazarbayev to set up a search operation in the country but this quickly got sidelined as the rescue efforts focused on the Indian Ocean.The doomed flight is said to have mysteriously “flew round in circles” and veered of course shortly before disappearing.Data from British satellites could indicate the plane was oddly circling above the Pacic Ocean in South East Asia in the moments before it vanished.Aviation expert Jeff Wise, author of the Plane That Wasnt There, said data from Inmarsat, may suggest MH was flying bizarrely during its last minutes.Usually a jet will circle at a fixed altitude after being instructed to do so by air traffic control before being allowed to land at an airport.A satellite called F had made contact with the plane in the hours after it went missing via a series of what is technically known as electronic “handshakes”.Mr Wise explained: Just as the motion of a speeding train makes the tone of its whistle go up or down, the relative motion of the satellite and the aeroplane shts the frequency of the radio signals transmitted between them.MH’s disappearance has also given rise to a slew of conspiracy theories - some far more bizarre than others.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The result this time could go down to the wire.What the country needs to ensure Corbyn’s defeat is a vast coalition of voters united by the one aim of keeping him out of Downing Street.This was meant to be the Brexit election but it has rightly turned into a referendum on Corbyn’s spectacular unfitness for high office.And the only result should be a wholesale rejection of his bid for power.To achieve that, all anti-Corbyn voters – no matter what their past allegiances or their personal hostility to Johnson – must vote tactically for the Conservatives.Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow Chancellor John McDonnell must be stoppedThroughout the campaign, Remain supporters have talked feverishly of the potential for anti-Tory tactical voting to stop Brexit.But far more potent would be a wave of pro-Tory tactical voting to keep out Corbyn.At the heart of such a drive must lie the millions of decent, patriotic voters in Labour’s heartlands of the North and the Midlands, who have backed the party all their lives but are now profoundly disillusioned with Corbyn.If they held their noses and supported Johnson, then Labour would face annihilation.There are already signs that this could be happening.The so-called “Red Wall” of around  Labour marginals from Yorkshire to Wales, characterised by seats like Bolsover in Derbyshire and Crewe in Cheshire, appears to be crumbling.If a new army of Red Tory voters materialises on Thursday, the damage to Corbyn could be phenomenal.This week were reports that Labour are even in trouble in Leigh, where Joanne Platt has a majority of almost , and which is only th on the Tories’ target list.Similarly, the latest poll in the Lincolnshire port of Grimsby, which has been held by Labour for generations, shows a big lead for the Tories.This mood of revolt against political loyalties was captured in the words of one café worker in Labour-held Wrexham, North Wales, who said at the weekend: “I’ve always voted Labour and my family always voted Labour. On Thursday I shall be voting Tory.”People like her recognise that traditional Labour – the party of Clem Attlee, John Smith and Tony Blair – is now dead, replaced by a dogmatic, intolerant movement dedicated to the overthrow of capitalism.The election campaign has only reinforced Labour’s unfitness for office.Lavish pledges of free services and extravagant spending increases have been dished out like confetti, shattering the last remnants of the party’s economic credibility.Meanwhile, Labour has nothing coherent to say about Brexit beyond the threat of yet more dither and delay.It is no wonder that the five million Labour voters who backed Leave in the  referendum are in such despair.Boris himself put it well on a visit to Grimsby yesterday when he said that Labour’s Brexit stance represented “the great betrayal, orchestrated from Islington by politicians who sneer at your values and ignore your votes.”But it is not just Leave voters who should back the Tories. Remainers who loathe the idea of a Corbyn regime should do so as well.A hard-left Government is too big a price for stopping Brexit, for which the British people democratically voted three years ago.The arch pro-EU Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, now standing as an independent in his Beaconsfield constituency, said recently that he was “absolutely satisfied that Mr Corbyn would be a disaster in Downing Street.”Yet Grieve is making that dire possibility more likely by trying to siphon off votes from the Tory party.Indeed, all the opposition parties are acting as Corbyn’s allies, whatever their protestations.Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, in particular, could still badly split the anti-Corbyn vote in a string of Northern and Midlands seats, like Hartlepool.The latest poll in the constituency shows the Brexit Party on  per cent and the Tories on  per cent, a far higher combined total of Labour’s  per cent.In Doncaster North, held by Ed Miliband, Labour is on  per cent against a combined total of  per cent for the Brexit Party and the Conservatives.Further south, a vote for Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats is realistically a vote for Corbyn, just as in Scotland, support for the SNP will help to propel Corbyn into Downing Street.The choice is stark. Our country’s security, liberty and growth can only be secured by theof a Conservative Government.There is nothing to fear from the continuation in office of Boris Johnson, who stands in the long tradition of one-nation Conservatism epitomised by Benjamin Disraeli and Winston Churchill.But there is everything to fear from Corbyn’s ascent to power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Experts are forecasting Labour will not gain enough support to put the Conservativesapos hold on power in peril. Butthe predictions play out, it could see some top Tory figures ousted - with No-Deal Brexiteer Foreign Secretary Dominic Raabaposs Surrey safe seat now looking vulnerable. The pollsters are attributing the blow to the Toriesapos campaign to the nationwide tactical voting campaign targeting pro-Remain marginal seats. Labour has gained two seats in the latest YouGov MRP prediction since the last poll two weeks ago - but some key red strongholds are also in jeopardy. The highly anticipated poll predicts Boris Johnson is still likely to win the general election with a majority of . The margin of error also means that experts cannot rule out a hung parliament. But the Tories are already preparing for major upsets. The party is said to already be privately predicting Cabinet Minister Theresa Villiers’ Chipping Barnet seat could be lost to Labour after she held by just over  votes last time. Labour has also been pouring resources into Tory Justine Greening’s old seat of Putney which looks set for a red takeover, according to the poll. YouGov predicts tactical voting in heavily pro-Remain seats could see Tories lose control in Chipping Barnett and Putney. Labour is expected to hold key battleground seat Kensington by a whisker again after taking it from the Tories last election by just  votes. Here are the high-profile seats the polls predict could tip... Dominic Raab, Tory foreign Secretary - Esher and Walton  In  Dominic Raab won the Surrey safe seat with a majority of more than ,. Pollster analysis suggests the tactical voting campaign has taken a stick to his support and Labour is facing pressure to prod its supporters to give the Lib Dems their vote to topple the Foreign Secretary. The campaign to oust the Tories is playing out in marginal seats around the country as voters are urged to abandon tribal allegiances and support the party with the greatest chance of stealing a win. Mr Raab voted Remain at the  EU Referendum but has since proved himself a No Deal-backing Brexiteer in Boris Johnsonaposs Cabinet. The YouGov MRP model shows tactical voting is producing a sht towards the Lib Dems, with the party now on % and closing the gap on the Conservativesapos %. Theresa Villiers, Tory cabinet minister - Chipping Barnet   The Tories are already privately predicting they have lost the seat she held by -odd votes last time. She is only two points behind her pro-Remain Labour rival Emma Whysall in the north London battleground, which is a Remain area. Iain Duncan Smith, Tory - Chingford and Woodford Green  The welfare slasher and former Tory Party leader has a narrow two-point majority over his Labour rival. The seat on the border of East London and Essex has been a safe Tory seat since its creation in . Mr Duncan Smith has held the seat ever since, but his stronghold is looking set to change hands.

He has held the advantage since the constituency was created in , but his power showed signs of teetering in the  General Election when his majority fell below , for the first time. Reports suggest the Brexit debate has tested some former miners in the Derbyshire constituency which overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU. Skinneraposs Bolsover seat is predicted to go Tory, as his rival Mark Fletcher gains a three-point majority in the prediction. Caroline Flint, Labour - Don Valley  The Conservatives are predicted to steal the South Yorkshire seat the veteran Labour MP has held since . The Tories are predicted to cause a major upset for the left as Labour struggles to hold onto majority leave areas in the North. She has put in long service for Labour but her Don Valley seat is predicted to go Tory, despite her vowing to back a Brexit deal on behalf of her leave-voting constituency. Phil Wilson, Labour - Sedgefield  The veteran Labour MP may not be as big of a household name as other election hopefuls whose seats hang in the balance. But his is a red safe seat with a high profile, as the former seat of Tony Blair . The seat is predicted to go Tory by a whisker, handing power to Paul Sewell, which would see Labour lost the seat to its rivals for the first time since .  The previous MRP poll had Labour to lose  seats to the Conservatives, but that has now dropped to . Both partiesapos leaders are hot-footing it around the country as they visit five marginal seats each in their final push to win swing votersapos support ahead of polling day. The final YouGov MRP poll, which correctly called % of seats in , shows the gap between the two major parties narrowing - but predicts a dismal defeat for Labour yet again.  Its final poll before voters head to the ballot boxes tomorrow has the Tories hanging on to power -  but with the partyaposs lead narrowing to a -seat majority. The poll has emerged as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is touring the country pushing his get Brexit done mantra. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is calling for a vote for hope in his pledge his party will Save the NHS. Both parties are targeting marginal seats in the midlands and north as the race to the ballots looms.  In the final poll, voting intentions would see the Conservatives hold with %, Labour with %, the Liberal Democrats with % and the Brexit Party with %. The poll predicts The Tories gaining  seats on aposs General Election result, Labour would lose , the Lib Dems gain three, the Scottish National Party six. While the polls suggest the Tories will still edge back into power, the latest predictions show the gap closing between Labour and the Tories. But the polls donapost predict great leaps for Labour.

The polls have Boris Johnsonaposs Conservatives tipped to win either an overall House of Commons majority or the most seats in a hung parliament.Of course, anything is possible, andJeremy Corbynaposs Labour Party does win an overall majority it would have a radically dferent impact on Britainaposs future.So how will these radically dferent forks in the road impact the state of the UK  Our head of politics Jason Beattie has outlined the dferent options facing the UK. Boris Johnson wins an overall majority Brexit: The Prime Minister plans to railroad his withdrawal agreement through Parliament before Christmas to make sure we leave the EU by January . Far from getting Brexit done this triggers the start of months,not years, of trade talks with the EU and other countries, including the US, India and Australia.Johnson has pledged to get a trade deal with the EU by December . If he fails we could face a no-deal Brexit on that date. What happens next will depend on the size of the Tory majority. If Johnson wins comfortably he should be able to play for time butit is a narrow margin then he will be in hock to the hard Brexiteers in his party. Public services: The Tories have promised more nurses, extra money for schools and hospitals and , more police officers.But their spending plans only envisage more money for the NHS, with education, councils and the Home Office spending still below pre- levels. And they depend on what happens with Brexit. If there is no trade deal the economy could slide and the Tories will not have money to invest in public services. This could lead to a stinging backlash from voters.  The UK: The Conservatives’ Brexit plans could lead to the break up of the United Kingdom.Leaked Treasury documents showed that Northern Ireland will be “symbolically” cut off from the rest of the UK because it will remain under EU for trade and there will be checks on imports between the mainland and Ulster. Nicola Sturgeon will seize on the Tory majority and Johnson’s hard Brexit to press the case for another Scottish referendum. The leaders:Jeremy Corbyn will face calls to quit immediatelyhe loses a second general election .Allies of the Labour leader will try to persuade him to stay on with a view to installing a successor who will keep the Corbynite flame alive. A bitter leadership race could pitch the left of the party against moderates who argue Labour will only win power with a new leader who takes the party back towards the centre ground. Johnson will be safe for the foreseeable future as long as his Brexit plans do not become unstuck. Jo Swinson’s position depends on how well the Lib Dems perform. There is a hung Parliament  Brexit: Everything will depend on the numbers. Corbyn could become Prime Ministerthe SNP , Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru agree to work with him.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says she will only back LabourCorbyn steps aside. If Corbyn can form a government then he has promised to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the EU and put it to a referendum. Buthe is unable to form a government there could another election or Johnson has burnt his bridges with the DUP butthe numbers are tight he could try to strike a deal with the Lib Dems and the SNP - but they would demand a second referendum as the minimal price. Public services: Labour will want to press ahead with its plans to raise taxes on business and the richest %.Rail, water and the Royal Mail could be brought back into public ownership. There would be a big investment in social care, the NHS and education. The SNP is likely to support much of this but the Lib Dems are opposed to many of Labour’s policies. Could scrapping Trident be the price Labour pays for the SNP support   The UK: If Corbyn can form a Government with SNP support then a second Scottish referendum is highly likely.Labour has indicated this would be an issue for later in the parliamentary term. A new Brexit deal is unlikely to isolate Northern Ireland as Corbyn is looking for an agreement that keeps the whole of the UK in a customs union. The leaders: What happens to the leaders will depend on the result and who can form a government. If the numbers fall in Labour’s favour and Corbyn becomes PM then Boris Johnson may try to cling on as leader.But he will be under pressure to quit having thrown away the Tory lead in the polls and the chance for a fourth term in government. Jo Swinson could find herself in the role of kingmaker evenher party failed to make headway at the election.

The monarch is entitled in law to cast a ballot in general elections, but royal tradition sees her choose to abstain. By convention the Queen doesnapost vote, rather than because of a legal impediment, says an Electoral Commission spokesman. Historian and author Sarah Gristwood says itaposs consistently been a policy of this Queen, since her early days as head of state, to stay completely above the fray. It follows on from a major reinvention of the monarchy following the end of World War One and the establishment of the House of Windsor. Even though she doesnapost vote, the Queen does have a very important role to play after the results have been announced.  The leader of the winning party will travel to Buckingham Palace where they will have a meeting with the Monarch during which she will ask them to form a Government on her behalf.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShe’s been serving hot tea, home-made soup and a hefty helping of kindness to homeless people in her community since long before most of us were born. And at  years young, Britain’s oldest volunteer - the amazing Peggy Maskrey - is showing no sign of slowing down. The selfless pensioner still spends three days a week helping out at the busy Charles Thompson Mission, close to her home in Birkenhead - just like she’s been doing for the past  years. Peggy, who met her late husband Ted at the Mission, first came here as a shy schoolgirl in . As an adult she waitressed by day and volunteered at night before switching to day shts when she retired in .Now - after serving more than a million brews and hundreds of gallons of wholesome chicken soup - she says the fact she and her colleagues are still needed is a damning indictment of modern Britain. Taking a break from the serving hatch where visitors queue to say hello, she explains: “People are still in need aren’t they  It hasn’t gone away and that’s very sad. It shocks me really. “People still come here cold, hungry or lonely. It used to be men but now we see all kinds of people women, families, all sorts. “We used to have a lot of children coming here, a long time ago, when I was young, the children would be outside, barefoot, now we are seeing them coming to us again.” Her hazel eyes flashing, she leans in to clasp my hand and adds: “Children are suffering today. Today, children still need shoes. “When I started here there was no money from the social and we didn’t have anything like the NHS - you paid for the doctor - but we thought things would get better when they came in. “It’s supposed to be that the government give people the money they need - people shouldn’t be poor - but it’s not working out like that is it  “You don’t knowchildren are getting to see that money, you don’t know what’s going on but for a lot of these people things aren’t getting better.  “Now there are a lot of people sleeping in parks, in doorways - I never saw that when I was growing up. “There are more young people coming here who are homeless, that’s one thing I’ve noticed recently, people who need help here are getting younger. “We get young mums in who don’t have the things they need for their babies - nappies and bedding or clothes. “So you can’t really say things have got better. “All we can do is make sure that anyone who comes here feels welcome and gets a hot meal and anything  we have. “Everyone deserves that. It’s just a shame we’re still having to help people in this day and age.” Peggy is part of a dedicated volunteer team that does just that - serving up hot meals and drinks to  people a day, as well as providing second-hand clothes and household items, to anyone that needs them. When the Mission was founded,  years ago by a local philanthropist, it aimed to provide people with crisis support, solidarity and the odd treat. Run entirely on donations, there is still no means testing and no referrals system, just help given freely to anyone who asks for it.  Peggy smiles as she remembers being presented with rag dolls with hand-sewn clothes and painted faces at Christmas time, the joy of her mum’s puddings made with milk from the Mission and winter nights spent watching ‘Magic Lantern’ shows with her friends. These days young people are still a priority with baby equipment and a Christmas toy bank two of the newer services provided. And Peggy isn’t looking to hang up her tabard any time soon. After having a double knee replacement seven years ago she seems in fine health. She doesn’t even wear glasses and is positively nimble on her feet. Last night she was out after being invited to switch on Birkenhead’s Christmas lights and as she reels off details of the youth clubs she used to visit, her memory seems better than mine. And as manager, Bernie Frost, , says, Peggy isn’t some kind of volunteer mascot - she’s a vital part of this team. “She’s brilliant,” he says. “Everyone knows here and she really is the heart of the place.” As people start queuing to come in, cold and wet, ready to warm up and get something to eat, Peggy jumps up to help. “I’ve done every job here,” she says, smiling and gesturing to me to follow her. “I’ve scrubbed this floor many times, when it was all floorboards. “If I see a job needs doing, I just get on with it. “That’s what I’m here for. If I was at home I’d get lonely. “If you don’t get out you’re not meeting people, I’m here with friends. I’d encourage anyone - no matter how old they are - to volunteer.”  So what’s the secret to her health and vitality  Patting her lilac-tinged hair, she says: “Maybe it was all those pans of scouse or the broth, the sheep’s head soup, we used to have at home that’s kept me going. “My sister lived until she was  and my brothers all lived into their eighties. “I make myself a hot meal every day do all my own cleaning. I don’t really sit about. Why would you ” Last year her letime’s work was rewarded with an MBE. She travelled to London to receive the accolade with two of her nieces and her cherished grandson.  “It was wonderful,” she says, her eyes filling with tears. Prince Charles held my hand the whole time. “It was such an honour and a very special day. I’ll never forget it, being there with the family.” Typically modest, she adds: “But I’ve only done what other people done, just for a bit longer. “There is a good sense of community here, there always has been, that’s never gone away. “When I was younger we’d sell pansies for the Mission, I’d take mine round the pubs on a Friday night and my tin would be full with money. It’s the same now, people are kind.” It seems like a daft question but I have to ask it. Will she ever retire  "},{"url":null,"title":"voters report huge queues dozens","story":"NewsGeneral election: Busiest ever polling stations with huge queues outsidePeople took to Twitter to say that theyd never seen anything like it as enormous queues were reported outside polling stations in London and other major citiesShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video voters-wade-through-flood-after-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics voters-report-huge-queues-dozens-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

For Labour strategists hopeful that a high turnout could see them defy the polls and be in Downing St by Friday, the pictures will come as welcome evidence that they can still win. In Manchester, London, Cambridge and Lincoln people have shared snaps of voters queuing to vote.

Iaposve voted at the same station and time for eight years, but have never had to queue before, said Craig Fordham, , from Putney, who had to wait for  minutes. Chris Schofield queued for  minutes in the Bermondsey and Old Southwark constituency. Itaposs about  times busier than it was in , and for the locals and Euro elections, the -year-old consultant said. Atmosphere is very London: orderly queueing and no-one is talking to each other! Mr Schofield said there were over  voters waiting outside, adding that there were at least three officers working at the station but only one taking addresses from voters.  Asked why he thought there were so many queuing, he said: I think itaposs the election of a letime for many of us. Alixe Bovey said she was queueing for  minutes in the Streatham constituency. Sharing a photo of the queue outside her local station, she tweeted: In  years of voting in Streatham Hill, always at about this time of day, I have never encountered a queue of more than six or seven people.

Even in the safest of Parliamentary seats, you awake with dread on election morn. Facing you that day is the most public and potentially humiliating Performance Review that any HR department could have dreamt up. Election Day is both a political decision on the big issues of the day, but also a very personal judgement on your character - by your neighbours, local newsagents and publicans, even extended family members. It is also a day that never seems to end. You start early with a am leaflet drop to catch those going to the polls before work. It’s a last minute appeal, but the electorate is a fickle bunch who often only decide where their cross will fall once inside the polling booth. Then it’s back to base - known as Committee Rooms in the Labour Party - for a hot breakfast before the grind of ‘knocking up.’With lists of identied voters , the key task is to GOTV - Get Out The Vote. And, oh, it can be dispiriting stuff trying to convince the electorate to fulfil their civic duty that previous generations have sacriced so much for. ‘It looks like it might rain.’ ‘I’m just waiting for my we to come back.’ ‘I’ve lost my polling card.’ ‘Sorry. Not interested’ are just some of the most familiar excuses. By .am, the excitement of democracy can begin to pail. But then it’s time for the high street stall the drive around with the loudspeaker on the car and visiting other committee rooms to thank supporters and strong-arm volunteers. Lunch has to be taken as showily as possible, generously supporting the local café or pub – sometimes both. An army marches on its stomach, and canvassers need a good spread. Before you know it, it is balloon and leaflet time at the primary school gate. There are now tiresomely strict rules about politicking near playgrounds, but a few stickers and flags for the Year s never goes amiss. Then the long slog until polls close at pm. Right up until the wire, house by house street by street chasing down every potential voter. Sometimes knocking on the same door a good three times to make sure of that much promised support.

Tory Camborne and Redruth could give Labour a spot of red in the far south west and the Tories have bellwether Calder Valley by just  votes. But Labour may be more worried defending a string of seats predicted by YouGov to go Tory. By far the most worrying of these is Bolsover - held by mega-veteran Labour ex-miner Dennis Skinner for  years. However, the Brexit Party have also pushed in this seat so could split the Toriesapos vote. YouGov also predicted Labouraposs Ashfield, Colne Valley, Keighley, Stoke-on-Trent North, and Derby North, where suspended Chris Williamson is standing as an Independent, would go Tory.

And Anna Soubry needs to take on the tight Labour-Tory ision in Broxtowe. YouGov predicted the Lib Dems will take Winchester - but only by a whisker in a mostly disappointing night. Banff and Buchan is where the SNP suffered the biggest overturned majority in  - can they win it back off the Tories  The Tories also claimed Alex Salmondaposs old seat of Gordon. The SNP want it back. Meanwhilethe Tories have a good night in Scotland they could scalp SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who has a , majority in Ross, Skye and Lochaber. And Labour should get a rare comfortable Scottish victory for Ian Murray in Edinburgh South. Buckingham elects its first party politician since  after Speaker John Bercow quit. Itaposs been Tory since .  .am Sheaposs not quite Portillo, but Tory Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers could be the nightaposs biggest upsetshe loses her  majority in Chipping Barnet. Itaposs one of two seats predicted by YouGov to turn to Labour. Marginal Barrow and Furness, home to the shipyard for Britainaposs nuclear arsenal, was tipped to go Tory after Labour MP John Woodcock turned independent then quit. Tory Hendon would fall to Labour with a .% swing, but has one of the largest Jewish populations in the UK so could be affected by the endless row over anti-Semitism. The most interesting result could be Tory Finchley and Golders Green, a three-horse race with former Liverpool Labour MP Luciana Berger standing for the Lib Dems.  am With the election result all but certain, the flood slows to a trickle with just a dozen results due between am and am. But there could still be high drama as the Lib Dems fight to win back Richmond Park, an ultra-marginal where Tory Zac Goldsmith has lost before - and has enlisted the help of PMaposs girlfriend Carrie Symonds on the doorstep. Nearby Twickenham is also a crucial result for the Lib Dems but they really should win it, despite Sir Vince Cable standing down. The Remain-backing area had both the highest turnout in the UK and the biggest Lib Dem majority in . am and later The sun rises on a new Westminster - or just the same old one - at .am as eight final results come over the morning. Only Green MP Caroline Lucas has a good chance of holding Brighton Pavilion after the Lib Dems stood aside in a pact. Thereaposs no such pact in next-door Brighton Kemptown but Labouraposs Lloyd Russell-Moyle seized it from the Tories by nearly , votes last time. The last bit of drama could be Tory super-marginal St Ives - which the Lib Dems are hoping to win back after four years out of power.

Juliet Blaxland, , told the Mirror in September that she believed her home, one the furthest east in the UK, would be safe for at least five years. But violent autumn storms, alongside big tides, triggered a dramatic increase in erosion, with nine metres of land lost in the past four months. After the .-metre section fell away overnight in a “cataclysmic event” last week, engineers found the row of three cottages was now  metres from the clf and unsafe. Juliet and husband Giles Stibbe, , will move home next week. Juliet said: “We knew all along it would eventually be demolished but it has caught us by surprise, as we could have reasonably expected another year here. “But ever since we moved in we were always aware of how little time we had left.  “Demolition is incredibly sad. It’s the end of an era.” She said that the house is a “landmark” in Easton Bavents, East Suffolk. The village, north of Southwold, used to have a church, a thriving market and many houses. But unrelenting erosion has virtually des­­troyed the community. Juliet and Army veteran Giles moved into the ham­­let  years ago, renting from the local farmer. Since then they have seen the demolition of several houses and the disappearance of the land between them and the sea. And engineers have now told the farm owner that all cottage tenants should leave. Demolition crews are expected to raze the homes over Christmas.  Architect Juliet and Giles are moving up the coast to the village of Benacre. The area suffers from erosion, too, but their new home is far enough inland to be safe... for now. Coastal Partnership East, a group formed by several local councils, has been monitoring the situation.

Levi Byrne was diagnosed with an unpredictable type of epilepsy triggering many dferent types of seizures earlier this year. Recently her skin turned blue, she stopped breathing and went into complete tonic seizures as her muscles tensed up.The incident was triggered by a virus and a high temperature and the young girl had to be taken to hospital immediately, Wales Online reports.Mum Charlene said: It happened that quick that she flew out of my arms and landed face down on the sofa. I was patting her saying, aposLevi, Levi are you ok apos and there was no reply. She was just completely stf with back arched.I tried to roll her over and her lips were blue and she wasnapost breathing. As soon as I saw how leless she was I just shouted at my husband to phone an ambulance. As soon as she came around her first words were aposIaposm going to be sickapos and started to vomit. While vomiting she had another seizure like that because she was rigid and going blue again.There was mucus coming out of her nose with blood in it and I actually thought this is it, sheaposs gone.  She was pretty much grey and mottled blue, she was in and out of consciousness and was shaking, like she was in shock. Her skin was freezing. It was terrying and hopefully we will never have to experience anything like that again, but with it being an unusual type of epilepsy, nobody really knows how it will progress over time. The young girl first fell ill when she was just two years old and had some episodes where her head dropped to one side. At first her parents thought it was likely an ear infection but took Levi to see her GP after she lost all muscle tone in her upper body and fell face forward to the floor.  The condition became more serious and at one point the baby was having around  episodes each day. Charlene said: The most obvious sign was the dropping on one side, but she did have occasions of eyes rolling, body jerks, head going backwards with chewing expressions and gulping sounds. Sometimes she was aware during them, other times she wasnapost. Her blood work was sent all around the UK which all came back normal. She was a little mystery. After  months, Charlene and dad Andrew were told Levi suffered with Touretteaposs Syndrome and a rare form of epilepsy, both of which could intertwine, making it dficult for them to dferentiate between the two.  It is all still relatively new to us and we are learning as we go, but so far we have learnt that there isnapost actually a name for her epilepsy and itaposs a mixture of dferent seizures.Some are focal seizuresand others are generalized , added the mum of three who lives in Pembroke Dock, Wales.

Harvey, from Guilden Sutton, Chester, was four years old when his mum Rachel Hughes passed away after being diagnosed with oian cancer, which then spread to her lungs and brain. The boyaposs family always go out for a meal on the anniversary of his mumaposs passing and for the past three years he has carried out this act of kindness. Early years educator Ashleigh said: Jack and I went out for a meal and as we were tucking into our mains, a little boy and his father walked over to our table - we didnapost know who they were. His dad said aposdo you mindhe gives you something apos and the little boy handed Jack an envelope labelled aposfor youapos. As they were walking away his dad then said to his little boy aposthis is the lucky coupleapos and as they walk off his dad said to his little boy aposthat is your good deed of the yearapos. We were left a bit confused, but when Jack opened the card to read it he looked up at me in shock.  He passed it over to me to read and I got all choked up and burst into tears, I couldnapost believe what I was reading. We couldnapost finish our meal, it really touched us. Harveyaposs card to the couple included five £ coins and read: In memory of my mum who passed away six years ago today. She was a very loving, caring and kind person who worked as a social worker. Please accept some money towards your food bill. Have fun with your family. Harveyaposs stepmum, Katherine Robinson-Sharps, , said: Every year we always celebrate Rachelaposs le on her birthday and on the day she passed away. We go out for a meal to remember her and for the last three years Harvey has picked a couple to give a card to.  This year he gave it to a couple that were so lovely and supportive and he felt brilliant - it gave him a huge confidence boost. After Harvey gave them the card, Ashleigh and Jack went to find him and his family to thank him and took a photo to share only which quickly went viral. Ashleigh said: We wanted to share what had happened to show others what a lovely and thoughtful thing Harvey did, heaposs a special little boy and so brave. He was quite shy and reserved, but spoke about how excited he was for Christmas. Harveyaposs stepmum told us that he had done this for the last couple of years in memory of his mum, who was a loving and caring social worker that did a lot for others. He wanted to give back to people in memory of his mum. I canapost believe how viral my post gone, the comments are so positive. His mum would be so proud and heaposs a credit to his family and we cannot thank him enough. You hear stories like these but never expect it to happen to you. It just melts your heart - we will remember that day for the rest of our lives because it was a special moment and we are very grateful to have met him. In , on his th birthday, Harvey gave up birthday presents to raise money for The Hospice of the Good Shepherd in Backford, Chester, where his mum was cared for, by asking friends and family to donate to them instead of purchasing him a gt.  His donations even led him to win an award from the hospice, where he was presented a glass trophy with a picture of him and his mum. Katherine said she has shown Harvey all of the comments and he was pleased,a little surprised, it got such a big response. She added: Weaposre thrilled that Harvey picked Ashleigh and Jack. They were both really lovely with Harvey and we are so happy that weaposve connected with them. We hope to keep in touch with them.

Colin Ainsworth, , from Liverpool, had entered the McDonaldaposs in Widnes during heavy rain when he stepped onto  floor tiles and fell down. A hearing at Cheshire Coroneraposs Court, heard how witnesses rushed to help, including an off-duty fire officer and a nurse assistant who tried to give CPR. Meanwhile, a member of staff went to NHS Widnes Urgent Care Centre to find a defibrillator but was told it wasnapost permitted for community use, the Liverpool Echo reports. Emma Newhouse, who was eating in the restaurant with friends, told the hearing by the time they found one, paramedics had arrived and were giving CPR. Miss Newhouse said: Colin got by our table and slipped onto his knees. He kind of smiled to laugh it off but he slowly landed on his back.  I went over, checkedhe was OK, checked his pulse because he wasn’t speaking and then the McDonald’s staff said that maybe he should be put in the recovery . We put him into the recovery then I said we needed to start CPR straight away. After the off-duty firefighter took over CPR, Miss Newhouse switched to checking Mr Ainsworth’s pulse – and asked for a defibrillator. She said: I did shout for a defib but the McDonald’s didn’t have one so one of the McDonald’s staff went to the NHSup the road but the NHS actually declined the defib, so we continued doing the CPR until the paramedics came.  In a statement read by assistance coroner for Cheshire, off-duty firefighter Russell Hardman said he had sat down with his food when he heard a someone telling someone to put a man in the recovery position. The qualied first responder stepped in and gave CPR for roughly around - minutes, although he said it could have been longer, until the paramedics arrived and took over. In a written statement, McDonald’s duty manager Roy Bartsch said he rang  and relayed information as needed and confirmed that an ambulance had been allocated. He also sent a member of staff to find a defibrillator, and that paramedics had taken over the resuscitation before one was retrieved.

Richard Williams, , opened his online welfare entitlement aposportalapos to find he had been allocated £ to last until January - on top of a separate sum of p that went into his bank account. He now has no idea how he will manage over the festive period - or keep a roof over his head as he is already in rent arrears. Distraught Richard revealed he has had to rely on a freebie electricity aposvoucherapos to keep the lights on in his flat in Plymouth, Devon. Richard has also had to turn to his severely ill mum for meals and feels ashamed about using a food bank.  He said: I have got all of £. and that has got to last me until January  because of their silly assessment period. The DWP confirmed Richard had been handed less than his usual allowance - because he had earned £ in wages from a previous job. Are you a struggling parent  Contact us on webnews@trinitymirror Richard revealed he quit his role as a fire safety assessor for Wood Group at Devonport dockyard on November  this year after a workplace dispute. He has struggled to find any work since - so reactivated an old Universal Credit claim to help him get through Christmas and New Year. Richard qualied for monthly housing and allowance payments totalling £. But welfare assessment officials docked most of his pay - on the grounds he still had a source of income between November  and December  - meaning he only qualied for a mere £. in December Januaryaposs welfare pay-slip, equivalent to £. a week. Richard expects to finally receive his full money come January  - when Universal Credit is set to pay out againhe remains out of work. But his rent arrears will have soared to £, by then, he says, plunging him into financial misery. And heaposs frustrated his pleas for a Universal Credit aposadvanceapos to get him through until the start of  fell on deaf ears.  I feel right - although I donapost want to be homeless, Richard said. I need the people in charge of Universal Credit to really help me at the moment. I rang them and explained I needed an advance, and they said, aposno, itaposs up to the systemapos . I said, aposwell, who controls your system  Who controls your computer  They wouldnapost give me a proper answer. Itaposs disgusting - itaposs really bad. Universal Credit is a single monthly payment for people in or out of work. It replaces some of the benefits and tax credits that you might be getting now: Richard believes the welfare system - introduced by the Tories in a streamlined overhaul of the historic entitlement structure - is not working and letting a lot of people down. The DWP said it wrote off £. of Richardaposs £ dockyard wage in November December when assessing how much Universal Credit he would then be entitled to. But he said thereaposs no consideration for the fact people live month by month and donapost have spare income to sort out them out later on.

The Clune Park estate, in Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, is now home to about  people living in only some of the  flats.Property on the estate was once the cheapest in the UK, with one flat selling for just £, at auction, the Daily Record reports.The area however has been plagued with arsonists, causing shops, a primary school and a church to be abandoned. Plans to demolish the blocks created tensions between the council and private landlords who were refusing to sell up. The leader of Inverclyde Council, Stephen McCabe, previously said: It is a decimated, isolated community. It is a blight on the landscape. It is one of first things you see coming into Port Glasgow on the train. It would remind you of somewhere like Chernobyl. It is hoped next year bulldozers could move in to demolish the estate. We are progressing our strategy of acquiring all the properties to demolish them and we are progressing closing orders, Mr McCabe said.It has been a long haul to get here. We are continuing to engage with people who have properties in the area and we are trying to reach agreements with them in terms of acquiring the properties. Officers are hopeful that some time next year, we may well have sufficient properties that we can start to demolish in terms of at least one of the blocks.  Things are moving forward. I can see the end game. Some of the flats on the estate, which in the early part of the th century was home to shipyard workers, are in such poor condition that they pose a health risk.  Councillor Michael McCormick, Convener of Inverclyde Councilaposs Environment and Regeneration Committee, said: In the councilaposs opinion all of the flats on the estate are Below the Tolerable Standard- they donapost meet the basic requirements to be classed as fit for people to live in. And the results of several, recent, independent surveys have done nothing to change this view. The poor physical and social conditions in the area, combined with the level of input required from Police Scotland, Scottish Fire and Rescue and Inverclyde Council, clearly shows that the private housing market has failed and that large-scale, planned intervention is urgently needed.  Six buildings now have active Demolition Orders against them. The council is working towards demolishing all the buildings and clearing the site to allow this neglected part of Port Glasgow to be regenerated. A decade ago it was estimated that it would cost £.million to refurbish these buildings.  They have deteriorated even more since then. We are making steady progress in terms of acquiring these undesirable properties. But the remaining owners need to recognise that the only future for these homes is demolition and, frankly, the sooner the better. Mr McCabe added: We will continue to work and engage with the Scottish Government and call for them to support us with our strategy in terms of acquiring properties and potentially provide some funding for new a new build development on the site.

In July last year, because Pollyanna was suffering from bladder spasms so painful she said it was like being in labour, doctors removed her organ. She has been fitted with a stoma and has an attachable pouch to collect her waste. Pollyanna, of Ilkeston, Derbyshire, who is unable to work because of her condition, said: I’d been dealing with bladder infections for as long as I could remember, even as young as about four or five years old.\u2028 For years, I’d have that feeling of desperately needing the loo – but only be able to squeeze out a little dribble when I went.\u2028 Then, aged , I suddenly stopped being able to wee all together. It was absolute agony and horric to face something like that so young. I’ve had to grow up very quickly. Pollyanna was given antibiotics everytime she suffered a bladder infection but as soon as she stopped taking them the problem ed.  She said: I’d have to wear incontinence pads to school. I felt disgusting and didn’t tell anybody what was going on. It really affected my confidence.\u2028 I constantly felt desperate for the loo, but I had absolutely no idea what was causing it.\u2028 I thought I was just unlucky, and one of those people that are prone to infections like cystitis, which I know some girls are. Pollyanna tried everything to cure her symptoms, including cutting out certain foods, but nothing worked.  Then, aged , she “went into retention” for the first time, meaning she could not empty her bladder at all.\u2028 She said: I’d had quite a severe asthma attack, and literally couldn’t wee afterwards. Doctors thought that it may be the trauma that had caused it, and eventually, I was able to urinate again.\u2028  “But over the next two years, I found myself being able to wee less and less. But then in March , while she was working in Boots head office, Pollyanna realised she couldnapost remember the last time she had passed water. She was also so bloated she looked nine months pregnant. Pollyanna said: Once I realised that I wasn’t sure when I’d last had a wee, I panicked and downed a load of water, hoping to flush everything out.\u2028 Looking back, it was the worst thing I could have done, as it was adding even more strain to my bladder – but at the time, I didn’t know what was wrong with me.\u2028 Soon afterwards, I began feeling really unwell. Eventually, I was sick, and my colleagues phoned an ambulance. At AE a scan revealed how dangerously full her bladder was and medics inserted a catheter – to drain away three litres of urine. This is six times as much as a fully ing bladder can hold. Pollyanna said: My bladder was close to exploding. Nobody could understand why I hadn’t been able to wee.  Taught to self-catheterise by hospital staff Pollyanna found struggled with dealing with the issue. She said: My bladder would spasm and so sometimes clamp shut around the catheter itself, which was absolute agony. Pollyanna had a raft of tests and was finally diagnosed with Fowlers Syndrome, which typically affects women in their s and s, in June . She said: In a way, it was almost a relief to be diagnosed, as I’d genuinely started to wonderit was all in my head and whether my problem was psychological.\u2028 Pollyanna had a suprapubic catheter inserted into the bladder through a cut in the tummy. It enabled her to drain away urine before it built up to a dangerous level but her spasms were still almost unbearable. She was rushed to hospital again in September, , after her family found her screaming on the floor. Pollyanna said: The only way I can describe it is that it felt like I was giving birth to my bladder.  I was screaming and screaming. In that moment, I was ready to die, the pain was that bad.\u2028 The nurses at hospital were lovely but Fowlers is still so little-known, even in the medical community, that nobody was sure what to do with me.\u2028 In the end, the only thing that helped calm the spasms was gas and air as that would relax my body. But even then, they’d soononce the effects wore off.” For the next few months, Pollyanna’s le was blighted by Fowlers Syndrome with her regularly having toto hospital for gas and air when her spasms became too painful. Then, in December, medics mentioned they could perform an urostomy operation, to create a new exit route for urine via an opening in the abdomen, known as a stoma.\u2028 Desperate to end her suffering Pollyanna went ahead with the six-hour operation in February .\u2028 "},{"url":null,"title":"young mum accidentally names premature","story":"NewsYoung mum accidentally names premature twins after infamous Kray twinsLisa Tarr from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire decided to name her premature twins Reggie and Ronnie - not realising that people would assume they were named after the notorious London gangstersShareCommentsByJack WrightLottie GibbonsMilo Boyd:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video mum-accidentally-names-premature-twins-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news young-mum-accidentally-names-premature-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The distraught youngster has now opened up about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her parent and his sick pals. The girl, from southern India, who can not be named for legal reasons, was gang-raped every weekend for two years by up to  men, counsellors believe. It is the latest horric story to shock the country whose authorities have been urged to do more to protect the innocent from vile sex attacks. It is understood the father, whose name also can not be revealed to protect the identity of the victim, would call men and take bookings for time with his daughter. Whenever the paedos turned up to the family home, the victimaposs mother would be ushered into another room while the victim was locked in a bedroom where the perverts would rape and take pictures of her. Authorities say that four men, including the dad, have been arrested and charged with rape, sexual assault and using a child for pornographic purposes, as the young girl bravely decided to speak out about her horric ordeal. Cops in India showed the victim pictures of around  men known to the family and believed to have been involved in the sick acts. But she was so traumatised by what her own flesh and blood had put her through that she couldnapost identy the suspects. I donapost remember any faces, she told police. Itaposs all a blur. The vile abuse began when the dadaposs friends would drunkenly tease and grope the victim in front of her apparently unconcerned parents. Men would come and take my mother into the bedroom, the victim explained.  I thought this was normal. And then my father pushed me into the room with strangers. Teachers living in the victimaposs neighbourhood first sounded the alarm when they noticed a change in her behaviour, leading them to ask about what was going on at home. Following a tip-off, the school then called in a counsellor from a womanaposs assistance group who then spoke to the girl the following day. It was then that the full details of the girlaposs horric plight came to light, after spending just four hours with a counsellor. The -year-old admitted how her dad would force her into a room with strangers and would make her take nude pictures of herself for the men that visited her. After missing her period for three months, the girl said that her parents took her to a doctor, who gave her an ultrasound and prescribed her some medicines.  Convinced that the girl was a victim of serial rape by at least  dferent men, the counsellor called in child welfare and she was removed from the family home and whisked off to a shelter. When asked whether she knew about contraceptives used to help avoid pregnancy and diseases, the -year-old said: No, no, we use condoms. The girlaposs mum was also violated by her dad and was similarly sexually exploited by men visiting the house. One of the men, who was first rebuked by the mum, then went on to assault the -year-old girl instead, the BBC reports. And the poor little girl had no sympathy from her mother who said her daughter had made the claims up in a bid to teach her parents a lesson after they had fallen out. [She] made up this story [of sexual exploitation] because she had been fighting with us and wanted to teach us a lesson, the mother said.

CCTV footage shows the suspect, surnamed Li, wandering around the corridors of the maternity ward before walking out of a room with the baby girl in her arms on December  -  hours before her arrest. Authorities in the county of Huishui in south-western China’s Guizhou Province were alerted to the suspected kidnapping by the baby’s mother, Chen Ming-xin, and her husband Mr Lu. The couple were reportedly among  people, including three other new mums, who were resting in the room at Lianjiang Hospital at the time of the incident. Ms Chen and Mr Lu said they would offer a cash reward of up to , yuanfor any information about their missing daughter, before Huishui police announced that they had arrested Li in her rental home just  feet away two days later. The couple were then reunited with their daughter, who was found healthy and unharmed. Recalling the scare, Mr Lu said he and his we had been fast asleep in the early hours of the morning, with their daughter resting on his spouse’s bed.  They woke to find their daughter missing, and hospital nurses were clueless as to her possible whereabouts. An inspection of the CCTV footage showed Li wearing a nurse unorm and surgical mask, but staff at the hospital said she was not one of their nursing staff. Ms Chen told local media: “I woke up and my daughter was gone. “The mother in the bed next to mine said she was carried away by a woman in a nurse unorm. “I wondered why she didn’t tell me, but she thought the woman was a real nurse.  “The suspect actually wanted to take her baby, but she wasn’t successful because she woke up. “That’s when she decided to take mine instead.” Ms Chen claims the hospital changing room, which is full of nurse unorms, is not locked and can be accessed by any members of the public.

Everybody in this league would want to add quality to their squad.“Looking at the bench on Saturday at Arbroath, we are a bit short. If we get a couple of injuries then you are short but you are always looking to improve anyway.“I’ve said before, I don’t want to go back to chopping and changing  players or whatever every window. That has happened for a number of windows at this club and that has to stop.“That’s why we were so busy in the summer so we don’t have to keep doing that. It has taken a bit of time to get everything right since then.“We are looking where we are short and what we can add but it has to be quality not just to add numbers to bulk up the squad for the second half of the season.”Next up for the Dark Blues is a home clash with one of the form sides in the ision at the moment, Dunfermline.Since Dundee have taken just one point from their last , Stevie Crawford’s Pars have racked up three wins on the spin.“It shows you what can happen,” added James. “We’ve kind of switched.

The big thing is they’re creating the chances for him and he’s putting them away.“I believe we’ve got strikers who are every bit as good as anybody in the league – and they will score plenty of goals with the right service.Arbroath - Dundee: Dark Blues# winless run extends to four thanks to Bobby Linn#s curler\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arbroath---dundee-dark-blues-winless-run-extends-to-four-thanks-to-bobby-linns-curler embed # secrettQXpZpu\" data-secret\"tQXpZpu\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“With the strikers we’ve got in our team, we have to play to their strengths.

She spent most of her time alone in her bedroom.One day she randomly bought an embroidery kit online and became hooked on having a task and “creating something beautul”, improving her feeling of self-worth in the process.Inspired, she was suddenly eager to take part in crafting sessions to learn more but could only manage a few steps outside the door.Nicola said: “Everyone was out living their lives and to me an achievement would be only napping once a day, instead of three times.“When I first started going out again it was terrying. I felt so shaky and unsure of everything.“I’d been in the house so long that one of our downstairs neighbours who moved in four years earlier didn’t even know I lived there.“I knew from research it was important not to push myself into things too fast, so I stopped at the end of the path.“Turning around to go back inside was a huge relief and getting back into our flat was like being wrapped in a big safety blanket but I soon became aware of how confined I was inside.” vw, px\"  Nicola slowly began to attend crafting workshops with her parents also in attendance, the first of which was a puppet making class ran by How It Felt.The social enterprise uses puppet-making and drama sessions to encourage people to talk about mental health issues, which Nicola says played a huge part in her recovery journey.From there she got the confidence to join other crafting groups and started an online distance learning course with the Embroiderer’s Guild to ease back into studying.Nicola says she still often feels unwell but the intensity has reduced to such an extent that she hopes to one day study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"day-hollywood-royalty-came-glasgow","story":"SHE KEPT her fans waiting, but Glasgow was still dazzled by Elizabeth Taylor when she came to the city on September , ."},{"url":null,"title":"sweet-smell-success-stunning-star-sophia-loren","story":"ON A rainy day in Glasgow, Sophia Loren gazes wistfully across the city, as starry-eyed shoppers gathered below in the hope of catching a glimpse of their idol."},{"url":null,"title":"fly-tippers-slammed-council-reports-rise","story":"FLY-TIPPERS are robbing Glasgowrsquos taxpayers, the city council has said, as figures show complaints are highest in Pollokshields, Langside, Southside Central and Hillhead."},{"url":null,"title":"boris-branded-despicable-immigration-","story":"NICOLA Sturgeon has said it is ldquodespicable for Boris Johnson to be ldquoindulging in anti-immigration rhetoric."},{"url":null,"title":"2020-edition-glasgow-times-past-calendar---need-know","story":"ITS the bestselling calendar that each year showcases some great images from our huge photo archive."},{"url":null,"title":"key-city-finds-first-winner---500","story":"It was a dreich day in Glasgows city centre yesterday, but there was one man that felt on top of the world despite the weather."},{"url":null,"title":"yoker-mum-faces-eviction-xmas","story":"PROTESTS have been held for a Glasgow woman who was threatened with eviction over rent arrears weeks before Christmas."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-film-festival-sci-fi-favourites-show-arches","story":"SCI-FI cult classics will be shown in the Argyle Street Arches as part of the Glasgow Film Festivals special events."},{"url":null,"title":"christmas-gift-guide","story":"THERE are just  shopping days left until Christmas but donrsquot panic.

However, there is no doubt his best position is as a marauding left wing-back.A product of the Aberdeen youth academy, Robertson has spent the last few years in England with Blackpool and Rotherham United.However, as a youngster in the early part of the decade he made  Dons starts, before knee problems hampered his progress.Clark Robertson, left.Keep an eye out for votes on the other positions and the final Dons of the Decade team over the next couple of weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdonian education through the years at aberdeen school","story":"In this week’s Aberdonian we#re taking a look at education through the ages at Scotstown Primary School.We’ve dug out these images from across our archive showing the school in action between  and .They reveal how the classes, students and learning activities evolved and changed over the years at the Bridge of Don school."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 11 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowACHA tenantIt has been a while since we carried a story where a tenant has a complaint about a housing association property.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Natural reforestation of this land increased carbon uptake by plants, leading to a  consequent decline in atmospheric CO and finally a decrease in temperature – the Little Ice Age.  This theory is supported by coincident changes in local pollen deposits and by Antarctic ice-core records revealing trapped air bubbles from this time period with low CO levels.Any lessons for today Unfortunately, today#s problems are on a completely dferent scale. Reduction in CO by reforestation in the th century was comparable to just two years worth of fossil fuel emissions today.*A Koch et al.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

If you do hit a deer, report it to the police, evenyou are uninjured and your car is not damaged, as the deer may be fatally injured and suffering.Jamie Hammond, SNH management officer."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 15 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan took this wonderful photograph of autumn on the Crinan Canal.Avril said: #You take things for granted until you take a walk.#"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 2","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode Delve once more into the wonderful golfing world of Bob MacIntyre with George Graham, Keith McIntyre and Stephen Day in Episode  of this Oban Times Podcast # This week #  broken clubs, statistics, slices and more.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd.

Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line.

Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"ardfern first responders recognised after saving mans life","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ardfern First Responder group was nominated for the  national Scottish Ambulance Service awards after their rapid action saved a Barbreck man#s le.There were seven other groups on the shortlist and the Ardfern groupThe Scottish Ambulance Servicesaid of the Ardfern group: #The team gives the community a sense of safety and support when an emergency happens in this remote area.#The volunteers of this group display exceptional leadership skills and clinical skills and always ensure a great handover to SAS staff when they arrive.

tricks of the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him. He obliged by standing to attention and snapping a salute, what a bonus. Perfectly exposed and works well in monochrome, great shot Alistair.

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"online-poll-think-won-bbc-scotland-leaders-debate","story":"But who do you think won Jackson Carlaw and Nicola Sturgeon clashed over democracy, with the interim Scottish Tory leader saying you cant have a disposable democracy.Ms Sturgeon replied by saying circumstances in Scotland have changed dramatically since the  referendum.: Live updates from throughout the nightWillie Rennie said the Liberal Democrats will make some dficult decisions for the betterment of the Scottish people, and Richard Leonard said Labour is the onyl party who could stop Boris Johnson claiming a majority.Audience members called out the leaders for their behaviour on the , where they were seen talking over one another and shouting, prompting the first applause of the evening.Have your say on who won:        name : ballot,target: ballot_,params:.push"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-scotland-leaders-debate-review","story":"ScotlandLeadersrsquo Debate ***COUNTLESS hours,  million crossed words and several pairs of soiled trousers later, the end of the GeneralElection debates was in sight.

It testies to the shameless refusal of our politicians to respect the results of the  referendum and the  General Election.Secondly,we could be ignored then, why should we trust that these same politicians wonrsquot ignore us now  Increasingly, we hear politicians keen to disavow responsibility, predicting that Brexiting will prove to be protracted, endless, in effect impossible.Thirdly, electioneering has been even more dishonest than usual. Anxious to win power by any means, all the parties in Scotlandhave put out literature which advocates tactical votingand fails to highlight candidatesrsquo party allegiances. We should vote, we are told, to stop the SNP or stop the Tories, to stop independence or stop Brexit. Scaremongering and demonising opponents are the order of the day. Such tactics may be less politically risky than positive campaigning, but they hollow out our politics.So it will be with justly heavy hearts that many drag themselves out to exercise their democratic right and duty.

All minds will be focussed on the prospect of a second independence referendum. Scotland will become the political crucible in which the UKrsquos future is forged.As this new chapter looms, we need to learn lessons from the election which is just ending. The campaign has raised many questions which need answered before Scotland can deal sensibly with the issue of its constitutional future.Most of these questions must be answered by the SNP and the broader Yes movement ndash as the matter in hand is independence. However, unionists have plenty of issues they must deal with too, as does the media.Letrsquos deal with the media first. Irsquom a journalist, so I should address the problems in my own house before looking at others. The media has failed the people at this election, or rather I should say, the BBC and the right-wing London press has failed.The right-wing press is what it is and what it has always been, and that will not change. Its hysterical, partisan ferocity is a continual un-healing wound which tarnishes the industry and the great number of hard-working, decent journalists in Britain, and the publications they work for, which are striving to tell the truth and do a pubic service.Just look at the way the story of the little boy lying on a hospital floor was treated. The Yorkshire Evening Post broke the story, The Mirror picked it up and ran with it, and then right-wing journalists, like the Daily rsquos Allison Pearson, peddled fake news that the image was staged.When you hear someone say lsquonever trust journalistsrsquo, we all know what papers theyrsquore talking about.The BBC has trashed its reputation throughout this election. When senior reporters like Laura Kuenssberg tweet out fake claims saying Labour supporters assaulted an aide of Health Secretary Matt Hancock, theyrsquore destroying journalism. Itrsquos simply disinformation. A student journalist knows that you mustnrsquot disseminate information without checking and confirming.Perhaps, the biggest election row was Boris Johnson refusing to be interviewed by Andrew Neil. However, many felt more than a little uncomfortable about the fact that eventhe interview happened, it would see the current boss of The Spectatorinterviewing the former editor of the Spectator .The media clearly favoured the status quo at the last independence referendum. Journalism must do better as Scotland enters this new phase of its political le. Thatrsquos the first lesson.Lesson two: Unionism must do better too. Not only will a rehash of Project Fear explode in unionist faces, it will do the public no service. The issues must be intelligently debated not subjected to hyperventilating propaganda.The unionist base must also behave decently this time. At the last referendum, Yes voters were subjected to torrential abuse. Nazi slurs were thrown around with abandon. Ugly demonstrations by hardline loyalists following the referendum result seemed to confirm every Yes voters worst fears about what the No base was really like.In turn, the SNP must reign in its own base. The extremes of the Yes movement are among the most vile in British politics. If itrsquos not taking part in purity purges and circular firing squads, itrsquos perpetuating conspiracy theories and indulging in sustained, organised abuse of those seen as enemies.Now letrsquos turn to the SNP and the Yes movement. For years now, the mantra of another independence referendum has been constant. Yet wersquore moving towards a possible second referendum with little change in the discussion since .Wersquove had some debate on currency. Instead of the  plan to keep the pound, SNP members voted to replace the pound with a new currency as soon as ldquopracticable. Other economic proposals in the Growth Commission may lead Scotland towards more austerity in the event of independence. We need a national ndash not a party ndash discussion on this.Moderate Yes voters, of which Irsquom one, arenrsquot prepared to blunder forward, as part of a nationalist dream, without fine detail and honest answers on the big issues.Will there be a confirmatory referendumScotland votes Yes  No voters cannot be treated as Remain voters were in England. Their cares matter. Independence cannot bring ision and hate. Many undecided voters may also back Yesthey know that a confirmatory referendum will call the whole thing off should negotiations between Edinburgh and London turn into Brexit Mark II.Do we really think a bare win ndash - to Yes ndash is good enough  Isnrsquot that a recipe for national ision and anger  Should the barrier be set higher ndash %  We donrsquot know as we havenrsquot discussed it as a country.How will negotiations with London be undertaken  What about borders  Brexit has shown us that borders are brutal stumbling blocks, killing trade and separating people. Will there be a hard border What about any orce settlement ndash whatrsquos the cost  How will negotiations with the EU for re-entry go  What will be the terms of re-entry What about our defence and security  What will be the composition of our armed forces  Our intelligence services  What about Nato ndash how would it respond to the removal of Trident from Scotland The last time we discussed these issues substantively as a nation was . Times have changed. As long as independence remained on the agenda, the debate should have remained updated. It hasnrsquot. Independence is becoming an empty slogan like Get Brexit Done. It needs to be meaningful. The Yes movement has to offer a refreshed prospectus.Therersquos no fresh start tomorrow ndash just a new chapter. This election has shown us how badly parties and the media have failed. Scotland deserves better as the future looms ndash for that to happen we need informed national debate.This cannot be left to the SNP alone. It is not the domain of that party to forge the future of this country alone. The SNP is entitled to be the political force that sets the path towards independence, given its all but assured electoral dominance, but it cannot be the sole power which refashions Scotland in the st century.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"voters-head-polls-third-general-election-five-years","story":"Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who gambled his premiership by triggering the vote, has sought to focus on his pledge to ldquoget Brexit done throughout the campaign.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, his rival in the race to Number , has instead tried to highlight his partyrsquos credentials on the health service and other domestic issues.The polls have narrowed in the final week of what has largely been a tame campaign ndash with few gaffes and many stage-managed visits.On Monday Mr Johnson came under fire for his alleged lack of empathy when he pocketed a journalistrsquos phone when asked to view a photograph of a four-year-old boy who was forced to sleep on a hospital floor.The following day, however, Labourrsquos campaign was rocked when a member of the shadow cabinet was revealed to have poured scorn on Mr Corbynrsquos election chances in a leaked recording.A terror attack on London Bridge ndash which echoed a similar incident in the middle of the  election ndash briefly disrupted the campaign, but quickly turned political as the Tories and Labour exchanged blows over how to deal with such threats.The third General Election in less than five years has been largely dominated by the  vote to leave the European Union ndash with Labour pledging to give voters another say in a second referendum, while the Tories have vowed to take the UK out of the EU next month.A poll by The Dailyand Savanta ComRes, published on Wednesday night, placed the Tories five points ahead of Mr Corbynrsquos party ndash indicating the potential for a Conservative majority or a hung parliament.But a separate poll by Kantar put the Tories on %, Labour on % and the Liberal Democrats on %.Voter turnout, however, could play a major role in the election outcome with rain, wind and chilly temperatures forecast for much of the country throughout Thursday.In a final plea to voters on the eve of polling day, Mr Johnson warned that the election remained on a ldquokne edge, but said it represented a chance to ldquoend the gridlock.ldquoToday is our chance to unite as a country and put the uncertainty to bed so people can get on with their lives, he told supporters in east London.ldquoJust imagine how wonderful it will be to settle down to a turkey dinner this Christmas with Brexit decided ndash and how awful it would beCorbyn and Sturgeon were in Downing Street advancing their plans for two more referendums.ldquoLetrsquos stop the chaos and stop the referendums.

These may have been used to tie mooring ropes onto, to help hold the roof on.The archaeologists working on site uncovered the carved stones scattered around a hearth within the remains of an enigmatic structure that contained three cists, two hearths and a partial ring of holes packed with broken off upstanding stones. Three of the roughly carved figures were also important enough to the people who used the building to be incorporated within the structure of one of the hearths and in the foundations of one of the standing stones. The purpose of the building and how it was used by the inhabitants of this site four thousand years ago is still an enigma.Dating the necked stones firmly will require further work, since they have also been found on Iron Age sites in Orkney. On initial evidence, the ones from Finstown possibly date to around the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, roughly BC.Identying the purpose of these stones, andthey are figurines, will also require further work, with a close study for abrasion, wear and any other marks on these anthropomorphic objects.Futher details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The then minister for transport and the islands stated in June  that we did not have the financial resources to extend the scheme to business-related travel and that remains the case.”The Air Discount Scheme was introduced in  by the former MSP for Shetland, Tavish Scott. At that time, work-related travel was included, recognising, in part, that providing a more level playing field for island businesses was key to sustaining population. In April , the government at the time cut business travel for the scheme, insisting that it broke EU rules.Ministers have since been forced to admit that this was untrue and that the decision had been taken for cost-cutting reasons.Mr McArthur said: “This reply from the cabinet secretary is just the latest in a long line of untruths spun by this SNP government in relation to the Air Discount Scheme. When Tavish Scott first introduced ADS in , it covered all flights taken by islanders to and from the Scottish mainland, with the exception of medical flights. It was designed this way, in part, to help businesses in the Northern Isles contribute to their communities and compete on a more level playing field with mainland firms.“For Mr Matheson to state that business-related travel has never been eligible under the scheme, therefore, is flat out wrong. Just as his predecessors were entirely wrong in claiming the decision by the SNP government to cut business-related travel from the scheme was required under EU state aid rules.“Rather than continue to try re-writing history, Mr Matheson should do the right thing and reverse this cut.”Responding, a Transport Scotland spokesman said: #The Air Discount Scheme directly tackles the issue of high air fares in the Highlands and Islands and underlines our commitment to supporting remote communities. “We are committed to continuing the scheme, which provides a  per cent subsidy for eligible passengers and is the highest possible discount under European regulations. Earlier this year, we widened the eligibility area for the scheme to include the entire Caithness postcode, as well as further parts of Sutherland.“The Air Discount Scheme is designed for use by inidual residents in the eligible areas as a means to facilitate improved social cohesion. It is not for the benefit of public bodies or private companies or to subsidise their travel costs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was the bankrsquos first policy meeting under newly appointed Ms Lagarde.The bank left its deposit rate at minus .% and its main refinancing rate at zero.

She is well known from her previous jobs as head of the International Monetary Fund and as French finance minister but investors will want to see how she communicates and explains the complexities of monetary policy to markets and voters.Other themes that may come to the fore at her news conference are her plans for a review of the bankrsquos monetary policy framework and how it defines price stability, the goal it is supposed to seek under the European Union treaty.

As an obstetrician, I have written often about the priority we should put on the health of our pregnant women and families as they truly hold the future health of the nation in their hands.We are less good at talking about the end of le, dying and the bereavement that follows. Circumstances surrounding a loved one’s death can be remembered by those left behind for the rest of their lives. The impact on families of a ‘bad death’ can be devastating and, of course, there is also an effect on healthcare professionals who deal with death and dying frequently.I remember a weekend working on the maternity unit when I was pregnant with my first child. I met a young woman who was at the same stage as me, but her baby had stopped moving. Initial scans had failed to find a heartbeat. Often this is when I can use my experience to find that elusive heartbeat, but not that day. I had to tell that young couple that their baby, their child, had died – feeling so guilty that mine was still alive. At the end of my sht, I felt exhausted, bereft and deeply sad.: Le expectancy going backwards in ‘many parts’ of Scotland, report finds: Grieving Scottish couple’s stillbirth charity to benefit from Christmas concertIt is often said that time heals but I am not sure about that. I think the passage of time can make it easier to deal with grief, but the pain may never leave us.Conversations are starting around ‘living’ grief and bereavement. As the numbers of people living with dementia increases, the experience of their carers is becoming a focus. They are living with and caring for someone, often a lelong partner, who may no longer care for them or even recognise them.Not a time of joy for allCarers may be isolated, restricted by the frailty and confused behaviour of the person they look after. Comments come from others like “at least they’re still with you”, yet they are grieving for the person they have already lost. For example, “I’m not a widow yet, but I don’t feel married either”, as one lady told me. Carers feel guilty and internalise their own emotions. Together in Dementia Everydayoffers a support network for the carers of those with dementia, allowing those dficult thoughts and feelings to be surfaced.I recently attended an NHS Education for Scotland conference that used the power of patient stories to explore the impact of bereavement on people. The main realisation was that we need to give our staff the permission, time, space, and support to discuss these cases as teams, exploring feelings and emotions, not just clinical facts. It often feels safer to focus on the latter, but the former may prove far more therapeutic. This, of course, can apply to the conversations we also have with patients and families and you can have with your own families at home.Why indeed am I writing an article about death and bereavement, when you perhaps want to read something uplting at this time of year The reality is that Christmas is not a time of joy for everyone – loss can be felt keenly, absence of a family member all the more obvious, a strong sense of missing someone or shared experiences, a trigger for grief suppressed. So at this time of preparation for celebration often with family, take some time to really talk, to acknowledge grief and even the awkwardness about mentioning it. I guarantee both you and the person you are talking to will feel better for it.

This week he gave me detailed instructions for how to spoil his ballot.They can’t be printed in a family newspaper.No one really wanted this election, and the mood throughout has been one of distrust and disappointment. It was called because the politicians couldn’t compromise, so the people had to.: General Election : UK heads to the polls for third election in five years: General Election : These are the key battleground seats in ScotlandThe unpopularity contestProfessor Sir John Curtice dubbed it ‘unpopularity contest’: to lead the country at the most critical time in modern history, the choice was between the least popular new Prime Minister ever, or the least popular leader of the opposition. Uninspiring options yielded only agonising, grudging decisions.When I joined the Tory candidate for Stirling on the doorsteps, I heard voters wrestle with their dilemmas out loud, unprompted. “I wanted to stay in the UK and the EU” “Boris Johnson - what will he do next ” And from someone who voted against Scottish independence: “Why are we Better Together in the UK and not in Europe ”In many parts of Scotland,you supported staying in the UK and the UK staying in the EU, you had to choose which union mattered most. But compromise and disappointment didn’t stop at the border.Brexit Party supporters were told they would trigger a political earthquake across half the country, there wasn’t even a tremor. Nowhere are the stakes higher than in Northern Ireland, but electoral pacts reduced the options for Unionists and Nationalists, Remainers and Leavers alike.: Do I need a polling card or ID to vote in the general election  Can I take photos at the polling station  Voting rules explainedQuestioning old party loyaltiesAnd everywhere, supporters of both the main parties were forced to question political loyalties stretching back generations.For every Corbyn partisan, there was a Labour voter feeling betrayed because their party has ignored them over Europe, or even more painfully, because the stain of anti-semitism has become impossible to conceal or ignore.Equally, Le-long Tories have asked themselves similar questions, wondering whether a party led by Boris Johnson still represents their values.You heard it in the tone of the challenges from audience members at the live TV debates - rare occasions when party leaders face scrutiny from a crowd they haven’t hand-picked.After nine years of austerity and three and a half years on from the EU referendum, the skepticism tipped into cynicism. It’s healthy to laugh at our leaders, but what does it say that the biggest punchline was a Prime Minister saying the truth matters to him To cut through the malaise, both parties tore up their fiscal blueprints and promised more spending than they have in generations. On both sides, the pledges should have been popular: tens of thousands of new nurses and police a publicly-run railway, postal service and utilities.But many simply refused to believe them. It’s not hard to see why when Labour made a £bn promise to compensate women hit by the rising retirement age, the day after their manesto launch, and Johnson floated the scrapping of the TV license - effectively overhauling the funding of the BBC - at a campaign event, conveniently on his most dficult day of the election.Meanwhile, the SNP put forward spending plans that would be undeliverable in an independent Scotland, while the Liberal Democrats overhyped themselves to the point of ridicule.It simply hardened the impression that politicians are willing to say and do anything to get your vote today, but only answer the questions tomorrow.An election of evasionThe -hour news cycle and our always-on social media culture should mean a new age of transparency, scrutiny and accountability. But this election was a pageant of evasion and deception.A Prime Minister who wants to open trade talks with Donald Trump refused to be interviewed for  minutes by Andrew Neil. Both sides played favourites with the questions they took from journalists and the outlets they appeared on. Frontbenchers have haunted spin rooms and trolled from the sidelines.The Conservative Party rebranded its twitter feed ‘FactCheckUK’ during the first debate, and paid to have Google search results for the Labour manesto led by its own attacks - a commentary on its own offering, which abandoned bold promises on tax cuts and social care Johnson made during the Tory leadership campaign.When events broke through the slogans, memes and s**tposts, like the photo of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr sleeping on the floor of Leeds General Infirmary, they were drowned out by a tide of misdirection and misinformation - briefings about punches that were never thrown, and conspiracy theories boosted by columnists and candidates.Most worrying of all, both leaders betrayed a disqualying lack of empathy when it mattered most. Apologies for failures over antisemitism, Islamophobia, and isive past rhetoric had to be dragged out them.Easier to drive a JCB through a polystyrene wall. Somehow, as society grows more aware of the power and nuance of words and deeds, our politics become more macho and unaccountable.New normalFor most of this election, journalists covering the campaign have complained about it being too predictable, almost boring. It’s understandable: we’ve seen the Corbyn Labour playbook before, and Johnson’s message of ‘get Brexit done’ was as strong, stable and inert as two years ago.But we’ve had technology lessons with Jenner Arcuri, the continuing storm over anti-semitism, a terrorist tragedy, secret trade documents and claims of Russian hacking, and a Prime Minister asked how many children he has - a question we still don’t have a definitive answer to.Consider how far the range of what is reasonable has shted: it was news that the President of the United States didn’t make an unprecedented partisan intervention in British domestic politics.Polling dayThis was the first winter election in half a century, and the first December election in a century.Going into polling day, experts said as many as  seats were too close to call. There were former Tory cabinet ministers standing against their party, ex-Prime Ministers telling voters not to back their side, and outgoing Labour MPs endorsing former rivals. This was a remarkable, unique, unrepeatable campaign.If it felt like the most important election in a generation didn’t matter, it’s because a now tired lesson was confirmed: you can’t push a binary constitutional issue through the world’s oldest parliamentary democracy.The machinery is too delicate things break.It can only yield more disappointment. Voters won’t have said no to indyref, and Brexit won’t get done both of the UK’s most isive questions will hang over the country into  and beyond.At least this part was over by Christmas.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"author simon griffin on why people have forgotten about good manners","story":"When I was young I wanted to play in the National Basketball Association. By the age of about  I realised this was increasingly unlikely to happen, partly based on the fact that most other boys were at least a foot taller than me by this point, but largely based on my complete lack of ability. But as I lay on my bed looking up at my carefully curated collage of adverts torn out of FHM and Loaded magazines, Michael Jordan looked back at me and told me to Just Do It.Whether it was inspired by Gary Gilmore’s final words before being executed doesn’t really matter, in  Nike’s trademark slogan was being plastered all over the world and  years later it’s still going strong. It’s enabled and empowered new generations of go-getters and high achievers – the ultimate mantra to prove anyone from anywhere could achieve anything in lethey put their mind to it. Wake up, get up, and Just Do It. Do early morning yoga classes, do a gym session at lunch, and do a creative writing course in the evenings so you can do your blog. Do a marathon at the weekend. Do that job promotion, do that new business plan and do the extra hours that you know will pay off one day. Do work emails in the rain whilst ignoring your children playing rugby, do amazing meals with exotic ingredients imported from all over the world and do luxury holidays filled with doing even more stuff. Fill your le with acts of great signicance and meaning and they will build statues in your honour. Just F***ing Do It.Of course, we also need to remind ourselves that we need to do the washing up, do the laundry and do the weekend shop too. All the stuff that Jordan and Charles Barkley never seem to mention in their adverts, like doing the car insurance renewal. We live in a world of perpetual doing. The list simply doesn’t end. There’s never a point where you get to check your list and say with a smug smile, “I’ve got nothing to do.”Which is perhaps exactly why we need to force ourselves to do less. Give ourselves time to switch off and do absolutely nothing.A few thousand years ago our lives were a lot more simple. Not necessarily easier, but certainly less filled with stuff to do. You got up, ate, fed your livestock, went in search of food, spent some time sharpening spears or arrows, looked for more food, then maybe whiled away a couple of hours making fires or doing some recreational drawing on the walls of your cave. Today – thanks to the miracle of smartphones – we can’t go  minutes with checking to seesomeone’s emailed a message that we probably don’t want to read, or updated their profile with a picture we don’t want to see.Not only are we stuffing our lives with more stuff to do on a daily hourly minutely basis, but we’ve more choices than ever before. A few years ago one national supermarket chain had  ieties of air freshener,  types of rice,  ieties of cola and a mind-blowing  ieties of coffee. No self-respecting café in  would ever dare offer you the binary option of black or white. We want dferent blends from dferent countries with dferent methods and dferent syrups and dferent milks and dferent foams.All this stuff squeezed into exactly the same amount of hours in the day that our cave-dwelling ancestors had. We simply don’t have the time for things to go wrong, sosomeone dares behave in a manner that dfers slightly from our own expectation of acceptable behaviour – for example, eating a boiled egg on a crowded commuter train – then a whole arsenal of toys are going to be ejected from the pram.Manners have nothing to do with class or wealth – as so frequently demonstrated by a iety of overpaid public figures – they cost nothing, after all. But they do take time, and in our busy little bubbles that’s almost more valuable than money. We’re cash rich and time poor, so who gives monkey’swe offend a few people by clipping our nails on the train or pushing to the front of the queue  You’ll probably never see those iniduals again anyway. We’ve all got a million things to do and are constantly reminded of the million things other people are doing, so the faster we can get things done the better, right  Well wrong. The faster we get things done the faster we get them done. Doing things properly always takes a lot more time, as Ralph Waldo Emerson said: “Manners require time, and nothing is more vulgar than haste.”Whether you’re doing the weekly daily hourly grocery shop, taking a group of hyperactive kids to the cinema, or signing up at your local meditation class, please, forget just looking after number one, and be on the look-out for number two as well. It’s much more dangerous when it hits the air-cooling device.We’re not talking Mother Teresa levels of selflessness here, just a few moments of clarity when we acknowledge that perhaps flossing your undercarriage within two feet of someone’s face in the changing room, might not be to everyone’s delight. A little lightbulb that pings on as you smugly sprint to the front of the newly opened checkout that tells you maybe other people have been waiting a little longer.We don’t need to Just Do It or Live Le to the Max. Turn off your f***ing phone and experience the truly le-changing miracles of doing one thing at a time.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates.

It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement..."},{"url":null,"title":"car of the week suzuki celerio sx2 ","story":".L Petrol, White, Delivery Mileage or give us a call on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"harbour assistant at shetland island council ","story":"Outline of Duties: Maintain basic harbour log including names of vessels using harbour, date and time of arrival, etc. Inspect harbour structures reporting any defects to the appropriate authorities.

Everyone was so nice and helpful # I just appreciate their help so much and they are all my personal heroes of the day.#Daniela and her husband are due tohome to Berlin on Friday but she said they have had a #beautul time on Skye.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/001WH0612NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 6th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Trees decorated or sponsored by local people, churches, organisations and businesses will delight , while musicians and singers will play live Christmas music on the hour. Take a seat, close your eyes, pray and invite God to bring you into not ‘that Christmassy feeling’ but the deep joy that comes from knowing Him through Jesus Christ.There will be a number of points where guets can interact with the trees – for instance add to the decorations of a tree with your own words of joy and thanksgiving, post prayer requests for personal needs and other situations around the world at the Prayer Tree, and use the Blue Christmas ‘remembering’ tree to remember those whose presence we miss due to distance or death. A Kids’ Craft room will be open for children to take some time to also engage with the theme of Christmas Joy.When you’ve spent some time taking in the Christmas forest, head through the link corridor to the new hall, where hot drinks and festive treats will be served.

It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabha puts irish women in the frame","story":"AN intricate painting is proving to be much more than meets the eye in its celebration of Irish women and their place in the world.Entitled Mná hÉireann Women of Ireland, the painting was created by West Belfast artist Meabha Magerr. The striking piece was commissioned by go-to Andersonstown physiotherapist Dan Turley, taking pride of place in his home.Meabha, originally from Inishmore Crescent, now based across the water, told the Andersonstown News that her interest and talent in art flourished ever since “I could hold a crayon”.“In our household, thankfully, you were allowed to be who and what you were. I passed my -Plus and wanted to go to the school around the corner and that was St Genevieve’s. I had always had a love of painting and came from an artistic, creative family.”Friends since they were teenagers, Dan commissioned Meabha, who has displayed her work at the annual Féile an Phobail artists showcase in St Mary’s University College, to create Mná hÉireann.“My biggest problem was finding the right face, the central figure in this case of the piece, to signy le force and strength. I had painted a portrait of Clannad’s Moya Brennan before and I just kept coming back to her face, especially with her being a Celtic woman, a setter of pace. I did change it slightly, the hair, the colour of the eyes, I wanted to convey the feel of her, not necessarily a repeat portrait,” she said.She continued: “I’ve known Dan since I was , we have a lot of banter. He’s a Michelangelo man and just to annoy him I painted the ‘Da Vinci rose’ in it,” she laughed. “There are forget-me-nots in the painting and fuschias, deora Dé God’s tears, as I’d imagine he’d cry to see the persecution women have and continue to face at the injustices in the world.“Dan was very clear that he wanted only positives in the piece, no negatives.”Contained in Mná hÉireann are leaves of ious sizes withnames on them of women from throughout history in delicate gold lettering, and not immediately obvious.“I spent time researching and wanted to go beyond the obvious,” explained Meabha. “Countess Markievicz is there, my great aunt Nano Mullan is on it who fought alongside Countess Markievicz, Sonia O’Sullivan is there. The names are quite hard to read and that was deliberate, as throughout history women haven’t always been seen. They’ve had to come through back doors, pretend to be less than they were.”The prolic artist said the painting and the names contained in it have proved quite the talking point.“James Barry is on it. A woman who wanted to join the Irish army as a military surgeon and disguised herself as a man to do.”James Barry became a pioneering surgeon who carried out the first successful Caesarean delivery.Meabha spoke of how “not all the contributions, the names are immediately obvious”.“Sinéad Burke is there, Sinéad who is three-and-a-half foot tall, a Dublin-based teacher, PhD student and activist. When I first read about her, I nearly skimmed past the article, which was about the fashion industry. I love style but have no interest in fashion. I soon realised the article wasn’t about fashion in that sense, it was about inclusion – a much bigger topic and much more far reaching in many areas of le.“There are olives painted in the portrait, in dferent stages of development which are symbolizing peace. Some are ripe, some aren’t, the meaning behind this is that this is an ongoing stage, peace is a circle of work that will never end, we are always going to have to work hard for it.“I’m glad that the painting is proving to be such a talking point in Dan’s house. It’s as much about learning in that you pick a name and find out more, there is meaning behind each chosen colour, flower and there are emeralds, in this particular case placed in the Celtic crown to represent the four green fields.“The ring formation of the wreath signies everlasting protection.

Over the few weeks she was at the hospice, she got to see so many performances, from a bagpiper, to a harpist and local school choirs - she really enjoyed it.\"The staff at the hospice asked us our plans for Christmas Day and the chef offered to make us all a turkey dinner.\"On December , one of the doctors askedwe would like to have mummy home for Christmas.\"On Christmas morning, we all opened our presents in our PJs at the hospice, we had the Christmas tunes on and mummy was loving it. Jenner left to get the dinner on and we all arrived a few hours later.\"We ate dinner together and played our family tradition of bingo, which we rigged, so mummy won. It was such a joyful day for us all.\"The next day, things dramatically changed. It was like mummy had used every ounce of strength to reach Christmas and now she was ready to go.\"Mummy passed away peacefully on December . She was surrounded by her whole family.\"This Christmas will be business as usual and well all celebrate together at my house. It wont be easy, but well all be there for each other.

Asked whether a Boris Brexit might be al for the Irish unity project, O’Neill insisted that running Northern Ireland into the ground was not the way forward for unity — which wiped out a few decades of recent republican history. Naomi Long also rejected the inevitability thesis.Colum Eastwood drew applause by attacking Sinn Fein for being absent from Westminster yet trousering millions in expenses. O’Neill responded sharply, by claiming the SDLP leader was “disingenuous”, highlighting SNP impotence in London. Special status for the North — which a Boris Brexit represented — was a product of Sinn Fein activism beyond Westminster, she claimed. We were only  minutes in and pan-nationalism and pan-unionism both seemed in tatters – except in North and South Belfast of course.Eastwood has enjoyed a good campaign. The nadir of his party’s  removal from Westminster left some wondering whether the SDLP would ever . He now stands of the brink of heading here along with a colleague. The SDLP leader may also have been buoyed by the apparent photo endorsement from Fine Gael Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Interesting that, given it is only eleven months since the launch of the “historic partnership” between the SDLP and, er, Fianna Fáil — a tie-up rejected by the SDLP’s MP-to-be in South Belfast.Naomi Long performed solidly and it has been a fine year for her party, its vote up % in the council elections and % in the Europeans. But a First-Past-the-Post contest remains dficult terrain for Alliance. Another issue is that Westminster contests are for the true believers. In , those identying as unionist or nationalist were twice as likely to vote as those eschewing such labels.The debate moved onto the health crisis and the associated problem of Assembly restoration. It was everyone ’s fault that it was mothballed. Not their party’s responsibility. Oh no. Michelle O’Neill gave no ground on an Irish Language Act, insisting it was a right. “It’s not an either or” in terms of a Language Act versus dealing with the health crisis was her line. Good luck with those talks on Monday, Secretary of State.Each representative performed creditably. But how much any of Tuesday night really mattered is questionable. The viewing figure for Sunday night’s UTV leaders’ debate was just shy of ,. More watched the programme immediately afterwards, where the contestants had to eat grubs in a jungle. Maybe UTV host Marc Mallett should have made similar demands upon the politicians. An internal BBC document this week showed less than half of - year olds watch BBC in an average week — and younger electors are least likely to vote anyway.A viewing figure of , for an election debate is not a bad figure, but over , people voted in Northern Ireland’s  Westminster election.So,  out of  voters last time didn’t bother tuning in.

We have welcomed the interventions that have been made around equal marriage and the right to choose, but now Westminster must step up and deliver the Bill of Rights that is their responsibility under the Good Friday Agreement.\"We will not accept any attempt to repeal or replace the Human Rights Act.\"Despite the £bn the DUP secured through their confidence and supply deal with the Tories, no one should be under any illusion that austerity has ended.\"Health, social care and education are all seriously underfunded and the resources that these vital services need must be delivered from Westminster.\"BusinessRoger Pollen, head of external affairs, Federation of Small Business NI: data-dfpadtargetingRoger PollenAnne MaddenPatricia McKeownGeri Cameron\"While businesses have not relished an election in December, there is a recognition that the current political situation has reached an impasse, so this may serve to break the parliamentary deadlock.\"The big loser in the process so far has been the way that domestic issues have effectively been sidelined.Roger Pollen\"All candidates need to focus not only on Brexit but on all the other issues which affect business as well, such as infrastructure, skills, business support and the scourge of late payments.\"We certainly hope that on the other side of this election some Brexit certainty can be provided. As new MPs take their seats at Westminster, we want to see MLAsto Stormont as part of the restoration of devolved government.\"EnvironmentAnne Madden, Sustrans:\"We are in a climate and health emergency caused by the way we live our lives. Road transport accounts for % of the UKs greenhouse gas emissions and the evidence of the devastating impact of air pollution is mounting. Yet we know the climate emergency and air pollution will not factor much in this election debate.\"A sht away from driving to healthier, clean alternatives such as public transport, walking and cycling is the best way to reach a zero-carbon future.Anne Madden\"However, these are devolved matters for the Assembly to tackle. Since Stormont collapsed more than , days ago, we have been left with a massive democratic deficit.\"But while Brexit continues to dominate the political discourse and will do so for years to come, radical decisions on reallocating the transport budget to encourage more of us to walk and cycle will, I fear, continue to be parked.\"EducationGeri Cameron, president, National Association of Head Teachers :\"At the beginning of this year, I travelled to Westminster and gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee to assist with their Inquiry into Education Funding in Northern Ireland. A report with some very positive recommendations was published and then progress halted.\"If you ask me what will the election mean for Northern Ireland in terms of education, it is hard to knowit will make any dference, with education being a devolved matter, but the NAHT took the opportunity over the last few weeks to engage with all local political parties and discuss what needs to change in education.\"School budgets are still at breaking point. Given the increasing demands on schools and the vital role they play in society, we urgently need a funding settlement that commits to year-on-year, real-terms funding increases for all schools to support the education of young people in these uncertain times. Our young people need the best possible education to prepare them to meet the future with confidenceGeri Cameron\"It is now widely recognised within the education system in Northern Ireland that fewer people are stepping forward to take up leadership roles in schools.\"A career that was once highly sought-after is becoming less and less attractive as decision-makers fail to invest in schools and educators and to prioritise the wellbeing of those working in education.\"A double strategy is needed to, firstly, support school leaders to ensure that these great leaders remain in their role and secondly, to identy teachers who can be supported into leadership roles in the future.\"We cannot wait another , days for change.

The collaboration between Balenciaga and Nuriev reimagines a sofa — the center of so many homes — as an example of environmentally conscious design, giving generations of garments and other materials another le. The oblong sofa — inspired by typical overstuffed recliners — is upholstered with damaged or otherwise unsellable garments and off-cuts from obsolete stocks of Balenciaga clothing, encased by scrapped transparent vinyl. Patterns, cuts, and tags within the stuffing are recognizably Balenciaga, a mix of past seasons and ideas. Intended to encourage sustainable practices within design and where, the piece reflects Balenciaga’s recognition of the responsibility designers have to counterbalance their environmental impact, and dedication to implementing programs that upcycle waste and contribute to a circular economy.

It was the bank’s first policy meeting under newly appointed Ms Lagarde.The bank left its deposit rate at minus .% and its main refinancing rate at zero. The decision to not change policy follows a similar one by the US Federal Reserve this week as central banks monitor the health of major economies.Lagarde: Governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely manner. In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets— European Central BankDecember , Investors are now waiting for Ms Lagarde to give her first official assessment of the European economy at a news conference in Frankfurt, Germany.Analysts think Ms Lagarde will stress that the economy still needs support from the central bank, and that policymakers must be on their guard against things turning out worse than expected.Doubts have grown about how much good additional central bank action can do to support developed economies the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged and signalled it would leave them alone through .Instead, interest is focused on Ms Lagarde, who presided over her first meeting since she was appointed by European leaders as the head of the institution that sets monetary policy for the  euro countries that use the euro and their  million people. She is well known from her previous jobs as head of the International Monetary Fund and as French finance minister but investors will want to see how she communicates and explains the complexities of monetary policy to markets and voters.Other themes that may come to the fore at her news conference are her plans for a review of the bank’s monetary policy framework and how it defines price stability, the goal it is supposed to seek under the European Union treaty. There has also been discussion of whether the ECB should do more to support financing of projects aimed at fighting environmental pollution and climate change.Analysts will look for signals on how she will manage dissent on the ECB’s -member governing council. A minority criticised the measures enacted under predecessor Mario Draghi on September .Those included a cut in the deposit rate to minus .% from minus .%. The rate is charged on excess cash left at the central bank overnight by commercial banks, so the negative rate is in effect a penalty that aims to push banks to lend the money to companies. The bank also started  billion euros in monthly purchases of government and corporate bonds."},{"url":null,"title":"500689","story":"The Creggan Community Collective has organised a pre-Christmas cultural event that will be taking place this week.Based at An Cro Mor, Creggan Community Collective has liaised with Valued Voices to arrange an evening of stories, poems, music, song and craic for Wednesday th December at pm.This free event will bring together Creggan writers Ben Dillon, Liam Diver, Caitlin Browne performing alongside poet, playwright and filmmaker, Damian Gorman, currently in the city working with the Playhouse.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last season, they won the Grade D final and after a gutsy display, with goals at the right time, lted the McDevitt Cupon Tuesday afternoon at Celtic Park. The decisive score came in the st minute with a winning goal from St Conors midfielder Eoin Mullan. The sides met in the group stages and it was the Tyrone side who prevailed. As predicted by St Conors coach Declan Toner, the final went right down to the wire. googletag.cmd.push St Ciarans got into their groove in the second-half and looked the likely winners, but St Conors dug in and always had a response. Sean OConnell scored - in vain for Ballygawley, while Ryan Mallons runs from midfield gave the Tyrone side the impetus for their comeback. Oliver Wasoski opened the scoring for St Ciarans with the first of three goals in a frantic opening  minutes. Ben Murphy pounced on a rebound when Tommy Rodgers shot came off the bar, before dispatching to the bottom corner of the net to level the score. Then came a second St Conors goal from James ONeill, after he linked with effective ball-winner JP Hasson. Along with the roving Fintan McGlinchey, they always looked dangerous up front. googletag.cmd.push WATCH - Coach Declan Toner hails the St Conors character... St Conors struggled with their kick-outs against the breeze and went nine minutes without a score before Ben Murphy slotted over, after a fine catch by Eoin Mullan at midfield. Mullan hit his first goal before half-time but St Ciarans responded with points from Sean OConnell and centre-back Harry McGinn. St Conors led - to - at the break and with a battling defensive effort kept themselves in command until the game sprang into le in the nd minute. OConnell, after having his initial shot saved by goalkeeper McAtamney, bagged a second Ballygawley goal. When he added a point seconds later, the sides were level, - to -. Fintan McGlinchey squeezed home goal and St Conors were back in business, but it was St Ciarans who were in command with midfielder Mallon driving forward at will. St Ciarans edged ahead for only the second time in the game with an Oisin Neill goal after  minutes. The St Conors response was instant. In a move involving centre-back Conor Kearney, Mullan had a shot blocked on the line by Paul McGinley before the Glenullin man bundled the ball over the line. St Ciarans poured everything they had into the closing stages. Padraig Kelly cut the gap to a point before a free from Harry McGinn dropped short. After bobbling around in the St Conors squad, the ball was cleared and it was the last throw of the dice for Ballygawley.

I am looking forward to getting started and engaging with the membership on a range of dferent issues.“I am under no illusions as to the challenge which lies before us going into . While a no-deal Brexit was avoided at the end of October, next week’s General Election will likely decide the fate of Brexit in the short- and medium-term. Our geographical location means access to markets in Great Britain, Republic of Ireland and the rest of the EU must remain open and unfettered. It is crucial that our members can trade on the same terms as before.”“On behalf of the Chamber, I want to thank Brian for his dedication and commitment. Brian has done a fantastic job of representing our membership and their interests over the last year.”“I am excited to continue to showcase the huge potential of the North West to the rest of the UK, Ireland and Europe, and I will be working closely with our members over the next year to ensure we can fulfil our potential.”Outgoing President, Brian McGrath said: “The past  months have been an immense personal and professional privilege. In my role as President, I have engaged with business leaders, politicians from across the UK, Republic of Ireland, Europe, China and the US to ensure the voice of our membership has been heard loud and clear.”“We’ve seen new record levels of tourists coming to visit, our retail businesses are going from strength to strength, and the announcement of a City Deal package in May has the potential to act as a catalyst to attract new and important investment into the region.”“ will present signicant challenges for the North West business community but I am confident that Redmond and Dawn will show strong and dynamic leadership, represent the interests and views of our membership, and succeed in carrying on our hard work this year.

The scheme is subject to an Economic Appraisal and the outcome of a funding application with the Department for Communities . If funding is confirmed, the project will move to planning application stage with further public consultations, followed by procurement.

in Capitol Hill, the Daacuteil, Brussels and Downing Street.“We’re on the EU side of the negotiating table and with our MEPs, MPs, TDs, MLAs we’ve certainly made a dference.“Sinn Feacutein has also delivered for East Derry.“We have led the way by decentralizing the DAERA headquarters to Ballykelly and bringing high quality public sector jobs to the north west.“As Minister for Infrastructure, Chris Hazzard delivered the A and the Dungiven bypass after decades of waiting.“Sinn Feacutein education ministers invested in the schools estate across the constituency and we have also delivered on community and sports facilities. “Sinn Feacutein is committed to delivering on investment and jobs across the constituency and improving the infrastructure including roads and broadband. “Sinn Feacutein is also committed to protecting our environment and natural heritage, and to effectively tackling the Climate Emergency through urgent and concerted action.“Sinn Feacutein remains fully invested and committed to the Good Friday Agreement.“The current political impasse is unsustainable and unacceptable and Sinn Feacutein stands ready to form a credible executive.“We want to see a new Assembly and a new kind of politics in the New year is what we’re working towards.“We want an Executive which is to be credible, delivering on issues such as public sector pay, safe staffing levels in the health service, investment in our schools, economic policies that deliver prosperity for all and that invests in rural communities, and a mitigation package that protects people from Tory welfare reform.“This is the election of a generation because what the people decide now will shape the direction of our politics, economy and future for years to come.“Discussion about our constitutional future is clearly on the agenda.“It is now a question of when notthe referendum on Irish unity will be held.“In April , the EU made a declaration which says that in the event of a successful referendum on Irish unity, the North would automatically come back into the EU with the rest of Ireland.“Irish unity is a means to enjoy many more benefits than what the union with Britain has on offer.“A stark choice is opening up between the narrow, inward-looking vision of Brexit Britain and the open inclusive vision of a New Ireland.“We’re without doubt entering a decade of opportunity where the freedom to choose our own future will be decided by all of the people on this island alone.“The opportunity now exists over this new decade to bring people together.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He also encouraged congregations to show the love of Christ by offering a lt to those who might find it dficult getting to their polling station.In his letter, the Moderator acknowledged the fact that Northern Ireland goes to the polls for the third time in a year, and this will be the third General Election being fought since . Dr Henry said that, ‘unlike most elections when the polls open in sunlight and close before twilight comes, in this first December election in nearly a century, they will open in darkness and close in darkness.”Dr Henry said that the timing of the election provided, “additional opportunities to demonstrate in both a practical and personal way the love of Christ through offering a lt to those who may have dficulty in getting out to vote, or may be a little apprehensive about venturing to the polling station in the cold or the dark.”For younger members of congregations he said that it “may be an exciting time as they participate in their first General Election. However, given the ongoing stagnation in Northern Ireland’s political situation, or the stalemate over Brexit at Westminster, which precipitated this very election, and other seasonal reasons, some may feel a little reluctant to go out and vote.“Even so, may I encourage you and your congregation to approach this General Election prayerfully and go out and vote in the hope that those we elect will work with a commitment to the common good and with generosity of spirit towards one another Dr Henry concluded his letter by saying, “As my predecessors have reminded us in the run up to other elections, engaging and participating in the democratic process is one of the ways that we may seek ‘the peace and prosperity of the city’ to which we have been called . At the same time please remember to pray for those in political authority, and for those who seek it.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I started out doing  metres on the treadmill and I’m up to three quarters of a mile now, I’m doing well on the bike too and I’ve lost a stone in weight.“It gives me a great sense of purpose to get out of the house and come here to do my training.“The road to recovery is a long one and I would like to thank every nurse, doctor and physio who has worked with me to get me to this point and all the staff in the Foyle Arena, they have all been a brilliant help.”George’s coach at the Foyle Arena, Rosie O’Brien said he was the perfect candidate for the programme.“The Steps To Health programme aims to improve physical, social and mental health wellbeing,” she said.“Barriers for George would be his balance but he’s doing really well and uses most of the inclusive equipment in the gym that is adaptable for all users.“He has shown great determination to improve his fitness levels and he has benefitted from the social aspect of coming into the Foyle Arena and mixing with other gym members and staff.”For full details of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Leisure Facilities visit derrystrabane leisure. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But with play-off hopes still very much an ambition this season, there is a positive ion the fact that the league positions are so condensed this year. Despite that defeat, there are still only four places between ninth place and third place, which is currently occupied by Omagh and victory over Midleton this week could leave Derry in a much healthier position leading into the Christmas break. That much is certain, but what isnt certain is what kind of performance City of Derry will produce, with the nature of the defeat to Enniscorthy surprising after their morale-boosting win at Bangor a week earlier. Decision making and ball possession were key issues where Derry let themselves down and coach Richard McCarter is hoping that lessons can be learned from the most recent defeat.“For a large part of the game we werent at the races and then two intercepts at the end made it look worse,” he admitted.“Its all really congested this year. Its tight so we just have to play well in these games andyou play well you have a good chance. It depends how clinical you are as well and against Enniscorthy we didnt do either so thats what happens.”McCarter and OKane had targeted three wins ahead of the Christmas break and whilst they got off to the perfect start at Bangor, those plans were ended by last Saturdays display which saw Derry fall behind early on and never recover.“We thought we could win that game and we thought we could win all three, especially because it was at home,” he continued. “Even at the end we thought we could have gotten something out of the game and thats why we were chasing, but well move onto the next game. It puts a bit of pressure on us now because it is a must win but again its onewe play well, then we will win butwe dont, we wont.”This weeks opponents Midleton sit bottom of the league table and a win for them would take them right back into the mix with seven other teams in the ision. That is the incentive for the hosts this weekend, but McCarter is determined that City of Derry ficus on their own jobs and finish a mixed year on a high to give the,m plenty of reason to be optimistic heading into .“We want to be in the top half of the picture,” he stated. “It just sets the tone over Christmas becauseyou win it it just leaves everybody feeling really positive looking into the New Year andwe dont then it will have the opposite effect obviously. We havent turned into a bad team overnight and well certainly be going down there this weekend hoping to show that. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have

the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the Mournes Gateway scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks. That is one of the many reasons why this vitally important service is not lost to Ballynahinch. A number of local post offices, which provide a much broader range of services including banking facilities, are now housed in retail premises.Cllr Walker added: ldquoIt is my hope that one of the major retailers in Ballynahinch will come forward to ensure that the service is not lost to the town. While the post offices are important to our major towns, many are also at the heart of rural communities across the district.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

These included the non-replacement of clerical staff who resign and y delays in the supply of equipment necessary for class use.Mr Ellis also slammed a proposal to impose a charge for school transport and labelled it as ldquoclearly unfair.He stressed that he was not taking the negative attitude that all cuts are bad.

He was very young and had been badly neglected. He had been kept in a confined space or a very small pen. Sony was very loving. All he wanted was to be loved and he thrived on attention.ldquoHe was a huge dog but very dirty. When we gave him a bath his coat came up lovely and white. We got him started with his first round of vaccinations and our followers stood by us financially.Monica works closely with Corran Kennels, on the Tobercorran Road outside Downpatrick, who come to her for helpthey need a puppy or dog re-homed, and Animal Connexions, based at Nutts Corner outside Belfast.Monica said: ldquoRecently a litter of  kittens were about to be euthanised and we managed to be able to find homes for all of them within a short period of time.Monica added that she has her own account with the two branches of Castle Vets in Downpatrick and Castlewellan and pays for any necessary medical attention abandoned pets may need out of her own pocket.ldquoMembers of the public are so good. When we put up an appeal on the page that an animal requires surgery or medicine they phone the vets and give money and it comes off the bill.ldquoI am so grateful to everyone. It can be tough going and running something like this takes a big chunk out of your le, but our team of volunteers are thankfully very enthusiastic.ldquoAnyone can follow the page. Just ask to join the group through the socialmedia network and followers will be able to keep up-to-date with what we are doing.Lana King, from Burrenreagh, is a volunteer with the not-for-profit organisation.She said: ldquoWhile the main aim of the page back in  originally was to reunite owners with their pets, there are times when nobody comes looking for a little lost one and thatrsquos when Monica goes beyond the call of duty and ensures they have a second chance with a new family.ldquoShe gets to know the potential owner, carries out a home check and follows it up. There is nothing she loves more than to hear how the pets she has helped to re-home or re-habilitate are doing.Lana added: ldquoMonica really is the back bone of Lost Found Pets South Down and has gained the admiration and respect from anyone who comes into contact with her.ldquoNothing is ever too much bother for her.ldquoShe has devoted her le to animals and makes sure every pet that comes to her receives the very best of care.ldquoEven though Monica suffers with a debilitating disease called lupus, she just gets up every morning and gets on with it.ldquoHer sharp wit, sense of humour and contagious laugh lts the spirits of people who are going through the heartbreak of having their pet go missing and reassures them because they know Monica will do everything she can to reunite them with their beloved pet.Lana added: ldquoMonica helps those pets who have found themselves either lost, abandoned, abused or simply not having a loving home to call their own..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Health.jpg","title":"Health workers take  industrial strike action  ","story":"HEALTH workers in Downpatrick took strike action last Friday ahead of a series of protests calling for pay parity and adequate nursing numbers.Nurses were working to rule yesterday and today at the Downshire and Downe Hospitals while a joint strike planned between their union, the Royal College of Nursing , and Unison, will be held next Wednesday.Hospital and outlying district services will be impacted as the strike will run from am until pm mdash unless a deal is done before that.Unison and the RCN are demanding equal pay for its members in line with UK counterparts and for increased nurse recruitment to protect patients in a failing health service.Domestics, porters, catering staff, administrative staff, dental nurses from all wards and departments in the Downe and Downshire Hospitals and outlying facilities will join nurses who have voted to strike for the first time in their -year history.Public support was high for health workers, including nurses from the Down Outpatients Department, who took part in Fridayrsquos strike.Hundreds of Unison members joined the picket in the morning and afternoon at Downshire Hospitalrsquos entrance with local drivers sounding support as they passed.The impact of the action closed the Outpatients department at the Downe Hospital, along with the Ulster Hospital, Lagan Valley, Ards and Bangor Hospitals.The Community Dental Service was impacted with the cancellation of the Ballynahinch clinic and two clinics at Downe Hospital on Friday afternoon.The impact was widespread for patients as day case surgery, ENT and gynaecology at Lagan Valley Hospital was cancelled along with the closure of the Medical Day Case Unit, Dermatology Laser Unit, Cath Lab and Ambulatory Hubs at the Ulster Hospital.The South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust said that that all affected patients had been contacted and would be rescheduled for appointments at a future date.Staff from the Downshire Hospital were strengthened by colleagues from the nearby Downe, who joined the picket.Unison members who work in the transport and domiciliary care went out on strike from am- noon while the rest of the workers came out from pm-pm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and SDLP election candidate Michael Savage showed their support as did SDLP MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and John Trainor.Unison branch secretary Marian Ritchie called on all the elected representatives present to give members more than a show of support.She told cheering strikers: ldquoWe want every politician here now to give a commitment to say, as iniduals and as a group, that every single one of the the health service staff will get a pay rise and pay parity.The call was met with shouts of ldquoGet back to work by the strikers.Ms Ritchie also told her colleagues: ldquoThe Permanent Secretary says that he has the money but not the authority and the only ones that have the authority are the politicians.

McIlhone won the ball off a Ballynagross defender and without even looking up let one fly from  yards out.Goalkeeper Ross Preece was stranded in no manrsquos land and his despairing outstretched attempt to tip the ball over the crossbar failed as the ball nestled in the back of the net.Two minutes later, man of the match Ross Armstrong made it -. He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

Over the past year, the level of recycled waste has increased by %.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran hopes the work to provide mains power to the new Flying Horse Road facility is completed as soon as possible.ldquoI do not know why there is no mains power but it is a little embarrassing that the CCTV cameras at a poundm centre cannot be operated and we have had to hire in a private security firm, he said.ldquoThis represents an additional cost to already hard-pressed ratepayers and I hope that we are talking about days, not weeks, for the mains power to be supplied. It is an issue council officers need to be on top of.Cllr Curran said that many people were keen to see the new centre opened, given that its predecessor at nearby Cloonagh Road was struggling to cope with the huge demand being placed upon it.He continued: ldquoIt is great to have such a modern recycling facility on our doorstep to meet the needs of people who are clearly recycling their waste in increasing numbers. The new centre is being well used and the council deserves credit for this major investment but, in my opinion, the mains power issue should have been sorted before it opened for business.Cllr Curran said that given the increased emphasis on recycling, the council is behind innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.He added: ldquoA number of groups have expressed an interest in taking part and I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success with ious items destined for the scrapheap given a new lease of le.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the recycling centre was operating without mains power.ldquoIt has taken longer than anticipated to connect the mains power supply at the new site, said the spokeswoman.ldquoAs a temporary measure, a generator and security firm are being used to cover requirements. Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working to have the mains power installed as soon as possible.The Recorder asked the local authority how much it is paying the security firm to police the new civic amenity site outside its normal operating hours but was not provided with an answer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Leitrim.jpg","title":"Sr Bartholomew’s centenary celebrations  ","story":"THE family of a Leitrim nun, who has lived in Africa for  years, flew thousands of miles to help her celebrate her  birthday.Sr Mary Bartholomew was joined by five nieces, including Dympna Kelly and Eileen Ramsey from her home village, who arrived in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, to mark her milestone birthday last week.Another niece, Mary McAleenan, from Slievnaboley, near Leitrim, who wasnrsquot able to make the journey, says her aunt had been on an adventure since she left home in  on board the Warwick Castle to care for ldquothe poorest of the poor amid the soaring heat of South Africa.Sr Bartholmew, was born Philomena Cunningham on December , , and enjoyed growing up with her four sisters and three brothers on what is now known as Kilnhill Road in Leitrim.She and her older sister, Mary Bernadette, who also became a nun, were among the first girls to play camogie in Leitrim before an official team had even been set up by the local Fontenoys GAA club.She was educated at Sacred Heart Grammar School in Newry and with her heart set on a religious vocation she entered the Assumption Convent in Ballynahinch just as World War II began.Her niece, Mary, said that being a nun in those days brought honour to a family and having two daughters as nuns set the Cunninghams apart within their small rural village.ldquoThere were nine other postulants accompanying Sr Bartholomew on the long voyage across to Africa. Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled. She stayed until Eileenrsquos months mind,and left shortly after. This was the last time she was home..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Sophie.jpg","title":"Teenager Sophie fundraising for blind charity  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager has embarked upon a fundraising initiative on behalf of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association.Sophie Millswill be selling raffle tickets for a host of prizes over the coming weeks ahead of a a key fundraising event in Ballynahinch Masonic Hall on February  next year.The Year  Ballynahinch High School student mdash who has been diagnosed with Albinism mdash is on the waiting list for a guide dog and has already been cane-trained by representatives from the charity.The teenager, who relies on the aid of her cane, is hoping that she will get her guide dog sometime next year, but is conscious that there is a long waiting list.Sophie, who recently finished in the top six of a SuperValu Superstars competition and was presented with a certicate during a glittering awards night at Belfastrsquos Titanic Hotel, is keen to help the Guide Dogs charity by raising money on its behalf.Her mum Marina said the estimated cost of training a guide dog is pound,.She explained: ldquoSophie wants to raise as much money as she can to help the charity which does not receive any government funding.

It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was the bankrsquos first policy meeting under newly appointed Ms Lagarde.The bank left its deposit rate at minus .% and its main refinancing rate at zero. The decision to not change policy follows a similar one by the US Federal Reserve this week as central banks monitor the health of major economies.Lagarde: Governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely manner. In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targetsmdash European Central BankDecember , Investors are now waiting for Ms Lagarde to give her first official assessment of the European economy at a news conference in Frankfurt, Germany.Analysts think Ms Lagarde will stress that the economy still needs support from the central bank, and that policymakers must be on their guard against things turning out worse than expected.Doubts have grown about how much good additional central bank action can do to support developed economies the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged and signalled it would leave them alone through .Instead, interest is focused on Ms Lagarde, who presided over her first meeting since she was appointed by European leaders as the head of the institution that sets monetary policy for the  euro countries that use the euro and their  million people. She is well known from her previous jobs as head of the International Monetary Fund and as French finance minister but investors will want to see how she communicates and explains the complexities of monetary policy to markets and voters.Other themes that may come to the fore at her news conference are her plans for a review of the bankrsquos monetary policy framework and how it defines price stability, the goal it is supposed to seek under the European Union treaty. There has also been discussion of whether the ECB should do more to support financing of projects aimed at fighting environmental pollution and climate change.Analysts will look for signals on how she will manage dissent on the ECBrsquos -member governing council.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
