Keeley\u0027s Pet Service explained that when temperatures reach 30C, pavements can be 57CThis comes after the Met Office urged the public to stay out of the sunshine as the nation is set to bask in temperatures of up to 38C.What will happen when Prince Philip dies?Who is Joshua Kushner?

Regulation 7 deals specifically with the temperature in indoor workplaces and states that: ‘During working hours, the temperature in all workplaces inside buildings shall be reasonable.‘However, the application of the regulation depends on the nature of the workplace, such as a bakery, a cold store, an office, a warehouse.’In addition, the HSE also requires that employers must keep temperatures at comfortable levels for employees and provide ‘clean, fresh air’ for them.How hot does it have to be to go home?Though no official, universal heat limits currently exist, both employees and employers must gauge when action should be taken to prevent serious health risks.‘If a significant number of employees are complaining about thermal discomfort, your employer should carry out a risk assessment, and act on the results of that assessment,’ the HSE states.Employees with preexisting medical conditions should also take extra caution in the workplace during heatwaves.In sum, although no universal heat regulations are currently in place in the UK, employees who feel uncomfortable should speak up and tell their managers. Having enough people to do compels the employer to act, per HSE regulations.What will happen when Prince Philip dies?Who is Joshua Kushner?

See how sneaky they are at this sort of thing? He finally conceded that the first versions of the Chequers papers were written ‘about a fortnight’ earlier.Mr Rees-Mogg, with deadly politeness, said he did not hold Mr Robbins responsible for a ‘worrying’ breakdown in Cabinet government. Mr Robbins thanked him. Mr Rees-Mogg now said that he blamed Mrs May. Mr Robbins gave a pale gulp, wishing he had not been so quick to thank the Mogg.It is often said Tony Blair lied to ministers and to Parliament when he took us into the Iraq War, and that his dishonesty wrecked public trust in our political system.If Mrs May has just misled her own ministers, on a national strategic relationship with the EU which may impede our economy for decades, her reputation will sink as low as that of the sharply hated Blair.

Drnaso\u0027s selection bucks the trend as the judges have typically rewarded novels up to 850 pages in length - whereas Sabrina has just 204 Philosopher and novelist, Kwame Anthony Appiah, the chair of this year\u0027s judges, said: \u0027Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the times, there were many dystopian fictions on our bookshelf - and many novels we found inspirational as well as disturbing.\u0027Some of those we have chosen for this longlist feel urgent and topical, others might have been admired and enjoyed in any year.\u0027All of these books - which take in slavery, ecology, missing persons, inner-city violence, young love, prisons, trauma, race - capture something about a world on the brink.\u0027Among their many remarkable qualities is a willingness to take risks with form. And we were struck, overall, by their disruptive power: these novels disrupted the way we thought about things we knew about, and made us think about things we didn\u0027t know about.\u0027Still, despite what they have in common, every one of these books is wildly distinctive.\u0027It\u0027s been an exhilarating journey so far and we\u0027re looking forward to reading them again. But now we\u0027ll have thousands and thousands of people reading along with us.\u0027The rest of the judging panel is comprised of Scottish crime writer Val McDermid, cultural critic Leo Robson, writer and critic Jacqueline Rose and graphic novelist Leanne Shapton.Organisers said this year\u0027s 171 submissions - comprising of titles published in the UK and Ireland between 1 October 2017 and 30 September 2018 - were the highest number submitted in the literary prize\u0027s 50-year history.The shortlist of six books will be announced on September 20, and the winner of the £50,000 prize will be announced at a gala event on October 16. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/24/17/4E8A5FB800000578-0-image-m-38_1532448216364.jpg","title":"UK wine makers say 2018 vintage year heatwave","story":"    Due to a wet spring and recent heatwave, vines have flowered early producing generous bunches           According to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) the conditions have been ideal for growing grapesBritain\u0027s in meltdown!

He thinks it is wrong for the production of the UK’s post-Brexit passports to go to a French firm. Under a future Labour government, the state would use its buying power to support manufacturing.The response to Corbyn’s Build it in Britain strategy was swift and predictable. Bracketing Corbyn with Donald Trump, the Institute of Directors (IoD) said protectionism is not the way forward for a post-Brexit Britain. Politicians must recognise the benefits of open, liberal markets.Britain has certainly shown strong support for open, liberal markets for the past four decades. Value for money for taxpayers demands that public contracts should go to the lowest bidder. The UK welcomes foreign capital, whether it is to buy up property in London’s Belgravia or to gobble up Britain’s largest tech company, ARM, bought by Japan’s SoftBank in 2016.And, despite what the IoD thinks, the experiment has been a colossal failure. Britain’s growth model – flexible labour markets, a laissez-faire takeover code, debt-fuelled consumer spending and an indifference to the fate of manufacturing – is broken. Living standards have flatlined. Wages have grown in the past decade at their slowest rate in 200 years. Productivity has stalled. The ready availability of cheap labour has meant there is little incentive for firms to invest in new capital or staff training. As the CBI has reported, the lack of investment means that British industry runs into supply bottlenecks as soon as there is a modest pick-up in demand.Corbyn rightly calls the belief in free markets “magical thinking”. Britain now has the smallest manufacturing sector as a share of its economy of any G7 nation, coupled with the weakest investment rate. The country that brought the world the industrial revolution has not run a surplus in trade in goods since 1981.So the idea of using the purchasing power of the state as support should be welcomed. It recognises that the two sectors of manufacturing where the UK remains a global player – pharmaceuticals and aerospace – have benefited from the procurement policies followed by the NHS and the Ministry of Defence. It also takes account of the fact that there is a hidden cost to always opting for the lowest bidder: a loss of skills and tax revenue from well-paid workers losing their jobs. Britain has paid a heavy and enduring price for the hollowing-out of manufacturing.No other country has pursued open, liberal markets with quite the gusto shown by Britain. As Corbyn noted, it is unlikely Emmanuel Macron will outsource production of French passports to a British firm. Germany builds its own trains. The Americans support manufacturing through defence spending and have a notoriously tough takeover regime.Doubtless, Build it in Britain will be portrayed as a desire to thrust Britain back to the 1970s, but using tax, trade policy, procurement and subsidies to support industry is not really that radical. It is what other countries do.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4671a58f90fa0ce003d006dabf59084b411b0ce2/0_175_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6357289c0a18f8628e05e4cbe446ae11","title":"no deal brexit poorer jacob rees mogg dividend","story":"Economists have a tendency to ide reality between the short, medium and long term to give them the opportunity to blame the critic’s impatience if their predictions don’t work out. Politicians, on the other hand, operate on short electoral timescales. This makes it unconventional, to say the least, to hear Rees-Mogg pushing all hope of benefits from Brexit into the very long run when, as John Maynard Keynes jokingly pointed out, we are all dead.So what’s the game? Why would a politician representing the good people of North East Somerset – whose livelihoods depend on the stability of our economy and who would be devastated by the no-deal Brexit he is happy to promote – seemingly behave so irresponsibly? Could it perhaps have something to do with personal economic gain rather than national economic opportunities?Rees-Mogg’s hedge fund, Somerset Capital Management, is managed via subsidiaries in the tax havens of the Cayman Islands and Singapore. He has defended the use of such tax havens, saying “I do not believe people have any obligation to pay more tax than the law requires.” And the laws that look set to stand in the way are planned new EU regulations aimed at governing the behaviour of companies such as his own.He has also enthused about the potential to slash environmental and safety laws after Britain leaves the EU. Regulations that were “good enough for India” could be good enough for Britain, he has argued.To back up this worldview is a network of self-styled thinktanks, with opaque funding sources and a passionate commitment to classical liberal economics. Leading the charge has been the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), with which Rees-Mogg is associated. Its roots lie in attempts to oppose the Attlee-Bevan move to the left after the second world war that brought us the NHS and the welfare state. The IEA’s mission is to promote small government and freedom for so-called “wealth creators”. Or to put it more accurately, ultra-rich iniduals and corporations. The IEA saw Brexit as an enormous opportunity: a once-in-a-generation chance to create a more flexible, open and vibrant economy with less bureaucracy and protectionism, for which read signing up for trade deals that lower environmental and consumer standards.And Brexit seems to be offering enormous opportunities for Rees-Mogg personally. His European Research Group (ERG) has been accused by fellow Tory Anna Soubry of running the country after Theresa May caved in to Brexit hardliners over her Chequers plan.Jacob Rees-Mogg is often seen as the “respectable” face of the Conservative hardline right wing. His style recalls an era when the British empire was flourishing and merchants traded grain, but children starved, and – most importantly – there were no pesky democratic constraints to prevent the wealthy enjoying their freedom. Far from offering us our liberty, the Brexit he offers threatens to turn us back into corporate chattels, stripped of our hard-won civil and democratic rights.• Molly Scott Cato is Green MEP for the South West and the Green party speaker on Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0ad3d456c242ad04ac3ee2c6c081aa479313de8/0_0_3937_2677/master/3937.jpg?w=645\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=41973f357f08b945a646c179589ff851 1290w","title":"why spend 840000 renovating st anthonys free school close","story":"There is mounting criticism of the ‘chaotic’, ‘brutal’ free school policy and lack of government support as at least five free schools shut down this termWhen Lorna Middleton was interviewed for her job as headteacher at\u0026nbspSt\u0026nbspAnthony’s free school in the Forest of Dean in March 2017, she felt full of optimism\u0026nbspabout the future. The little school, based in two Victorian houses linked\u0026nbspby an\u0026nbspextension, had been lined up to join a local academy\u0026nbspchain and move to new school buildings.By the time she started the job that September, however, that plan had been abandoned and instead a\u0026nbspprogramme of refurbishment had begun – work that would cost taxpayers £840,000. Middleton has never been given a reason for the change of plan.Then, last Friday, the school closed for the final time, shut down by the DfE.Middleton and her chair of governors now say the government has let the school down. “The experience, for me, of interacting with the government has\u0026nbspbeen brutal,” Middleton says. She believes the closure shows that its approach to free schools is poorly thought-through. “Having set up the school and invested in the buildings, why did the DfE not provide it with more\u0026nbspsupport?” she asks.Free school supporters still champion the policy as a success. They argue these schools have better exam results than others. And they believe ministers’ willingness to step in and close schools when they struggle is a strength of the programme – despite the impact on pupils.Middleton says: “The DfE will keep telling you that free schools benefit from the ‘freedom’ from control, either by the local authority or by the DfE itself. That sounds brilliant. But there has to be some quality control upfront, before these schools are allowed to open, including the buildings. In our case that never seems to have happened.”Based in the former mining town of Cinderford, St\u0026nbspAnthony’s started out as a fee-charging Catholic day school in the 1960s. It joined the state sector as a free school in September 2013. Middleton says she\u0026nbsphas never seen any record of a\u0026nbspvisit by the DfE before the transfer.In 2015 the then headteacher sought funding from the DfE for improvements after an engineering report showed the buildings were unsafe. The engineers highlighted “urgentpotential for danger to life” in the electrics, including there being no cover to an electrical distribution board and “potential access to live wiring”.No money was offered by the DfE at the time. In February 2017, a safety\u0026nbspaudit by Gloucestershire county council, warned that “the risk to life from fire is high”. There were “significant deficiencies in fire precautions” with “insufficient fire separation between floors”. The document set out 17\u0026nbspbullet points of\u0026nbspbuilding “hazards”. Draft minutes from a meeting of the school’s governors, five months later, stated that fire safety was “currently inadequate”. Refurbishment to fix the problems began when Middleton arrived.Then there were the finances. Upon starting her job, Middleton found there was only £130 in the school’s bank account. She managed to secure an interim loan of £65,000 from the DfE to pay the staff.In December 2017, at the end of Middleton’s first term, St Anthony’s failed an Ofsted inspection. It was the school’s second poor report the\u0026nbspfirst was in May 2015, long before Middleton arrived. The 2017 report said leadership and management had been “dysfunctional” over time. Teachers’ subject knowledge was “weak” and the curriculum “poorly designed”. Before Middleton arrived, the school had used £150,000 – nearly half of its entire budget – to\u0026nbsppay for “leadership consultancy support”, with spending having gone “unchecked and unchallenged by governors”, said the inspectors. Ofsted also highlighted the delay in sorting out the building safety problems. But Ofsted also said: “The current headteacher has a\u0026nbspclear understanding of the school’s failings and what is required to bring about the urgent improvements necessary. Poor performance is now being addressed systematically.”By January this year, the refurbishment was complete. But then, just days later, Middleton says she was called to the DfE in London for a meeting with Lord Agnew, the minister with responsibility for free schools, to be told that, following the December Ofsted report, he was\u0026nbsp“minded” to\u0026nbspclose St\u0026nbspAnthony’s. Over the next few months, Middleton and Anselm Jacobs, the chair of governors, tried to persuade the DfE\u0026nbspotherwise.Jacobs, who has 20 years’ experience of school governance, and joined St Anthony’s at\u0026nbspthe same time as Middleton, says the government’s free schools policy is “chaotic”. He adds: “The\u0026nbspvoluntary-aided school where I’m a governor works like an absolute dream compared with my\u0026nbspexperience here. It often seems as if the DfE doesn’t have a clue.”They are not the first school leaders to fight back after a closure. In 2014, Education  revealed how the chair of governors of the Discovery free school in West Sussex, described the policy as “rushed and\u0026nbspill-considered”.At Robert Owen academy in Hereford, another free school closing this summer, Chris Morgan, the chair of\u0026nbspgovernors, says the closure has had a damaging effect on some students. He believes the DfE\u0026nbspis more willing to pull the plug\u0026nbspon free schools than other schools. “Establishing a\u0026nbspschool from scratch, in the face of tricky local politics\u0026nbspa generally unsympathetic Ofsted system and in the context of\u0026nbspspare places in other schools was always going to be tough. We needed more support.”Last month, another free school called Discovery, in Newcastle upon Tyne, announced its closure after four years, despite a reported £9m spent creating it. The local Labour council leader said it was a “damning indictment of the government’s high-risk experiment in our education system”.\u0026nbspA DfE spokesman says the closure of St Anthony’s was to do with “improvement issues”. The school “was judged as inadequate by Ofsted in December 2017 and since then has received extensive support from the department, including bespoke advice from education advisers and\u0026nbspfinancial guidance to\u0026nbsptry to bring about the improvements it needed. Funding awarded to the school for building repairs was for essential work to make sure that the building was safe, and had no connection with the improvement issues that the school faced.” Yet the proposal to close the school was announced barely a month after\u0026nbspOfsted visited. Middleton says the only visit she has had from DfE consultants – other than administrators preparing its closure – came from two finance people who arrived for a few hours in May.The DfE spokesman adds that St\u0026nbspAnthony’s was subject to “rigorous due diligence before its free school application was approved”. He did not reply to the specific question of whether this included a visit from the DfE.He adds: “The free schools programme has brought ersity and innovation to English education. More than eight in 10 free schools are rated good or outstanding, with pupils making more progress at the end of GCSEs on average than pupils at other secondary schools.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4580ca9c41a63fd02bf92053e7aae1faf275ff22/0_0_3109_1865/master/3109.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8bb60eee206e0ad8878ed898af0a617","title":"french girl fashion bardot hardy","story":"The classic archetype has been remixed for the Instagram era – with lace, wicker baskets and cornflowers rather than smoky eyes and smouldering GauloisesFor most viewers of the World Cup final, Brigitte Macron was not the star – she was a footnote to the footy. But, for a small, fashion-conscious minority she stole the show. Brigitte, in skinny black trousers, oversized blouse, with artfully déshabillé hair, eyeliner and even more artfully bored smoulder, she was a classic French Girl.Over the last 10 years, the French Girl has become fashion’s muse. There are books written dedicated to her style, more than 4m posts tagged #frenchgirl on Instagram and endless articles on how to get various components of the look – from the hair to the under-eye circles to the jeans.Even if you object to the fact that she has remained a girl rather than a woman throughout her reign, there is little doubt the French Girl look is seductive. It is thanks to her that you own a Breton top and ballet flats and wonder if you have the “right” micellar water in your bathroom.Macron’s look is the familiar blue-chip version – the one usually accompanied by an unfiltered Gauloises cigarette, coffee and conversation about Simone de Beauvoir. But fashion has moved on – and it is all thanks to Instagram. In the social media age the French Girl has swapped her detached cool for a carefree smile and windswept hair. She is often to be found on the Riviera, sauntering around a cobbled town with a wicker basket full of artisan brie and cornflowers, or in a sun-dappled meadow. She is wearing a white broderie anglaise or lace blouse and, if you’re going the whole way, a XXXXL La Bomba straw hat, made by Marseille-born designer, Simon Porte Jacquemus. Think more Brigitte Bardot or Françoise Hardy on the beach than Juliette Gréco or Catherine Deneuve on the Left Bank.Have a closer look on Instagram, though, and the French Girl phenomenon is now so popular that the birthplace of anyone wearing the look is no longer important. See American fashion blogger Leandra Medine Cohen of the Man Repeller with a different wicker bag every day, British model and editor Lucy Williams in one of those blouses and Moldovan fashion blogger Beatrice Gutu in a La Bomba, often backdropped by a beach. Anyone can do the look – even if they hail from Hampshire, like Alexa\u0026nbspChung.This broadening-out has also affected brands. There are the French ones, such as Sandro, Maje and Sezane enjoying a renaissance. But others are also peddling the look without being French at all. High street favourites such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Urban Outfitters play on the aesthetic. Être Cécile, which trades on cheeky Bretons, was founded by two Australians living in London. French Girl Organics is a skincare brand based in Seattle. And Réalisation Par – the label behind this summer’s most-desired, and trés insouciant, leopard-print skirt – was also created by two Australians, and comes complete with that all-important accent in its branding, and a name that translates as “styled by”.Of course, this look owes an awful lot to the ultimate non-French, French Girl, Jane Birkin. Thanks to a love affair with Serge Gainsbourg, she was transplanted from London to Cannes in the 70s, and became a style icon for her basket, jeans and annoyingly perfectly imperfect hair. But even Birkin didn’t start it. She joins New York-born Josephine Baker finding a home in Paris in the 20s, and Iowan Jean Seberg in Jean-Luc Godard’s A Bout de Souffle in 1960 in the timeline of non-French French Girls. Because even if its latest home is on social media, the whole French Girl thing is timeworn, and links back to a universal, aspirational nonchalance. “All the Parisian women want the others to believe that she just woke up and is effortlessly beautiful in 10 minutes,” says Sézane’s founder, Morgane Sezalory. “Of course, it’s not true.”Beyond this little blanc lie, there are, of course, problems with this muse – she is, typically, thin, white and, as the name suggests, not allowed to age. But perhaps this shift to a sort of everywoman means the French Girl ideal is becoming more inclusive. Interestingly, though, she is no longer the only contestant in the fashion Miss World. Scandi style is almost equally as fetishised – with the requisite books and Instagram posts. A summer-in-Positano Italian Girl – sorry, Woman– is the latest muse to arrive on the scene. With Birkin now a familiar reference, Sophia Loren and Claudia Cardinale feel fresh. We will soon be trying to replicate their big hair, lowcut floral dresses and neckerchiefs. Beyoncé already is.

Chalamet will star alongside Steve Carell in Beautiful Boy, about a father helping his son deal with methamphetamine addiction Dench will play Joan Stanley, a retired scientist and former Soviet agent, in Red Joan, a film inspired by the real life story of Melita Norwood and Stenberg has been cast as the lead of The Hate U Give, an adaptation of Angie Thomas’s novel revolving around the police killing of an African American teenager.All three films will be given a gala screening at the festival, and are world premieres although the jostling between the three biggest autumn film festivals – Toronto, Venice and Telluride – means the picture is not entirely clear. Two of Toronto’s most high-profile selections are definitely not world firsts: A Star Is Born, the latest remake of the classic story with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, and First Man, the Neil Armstrong biopic starring Ryan Gosling and directed by Damien Chazelle, both receive their world premieres at Venice. Widows, the Steve McQueen-directed remake of the Lynda La Plante 80s TV series, is billed as a world premiere, but may screen at Telluride (which runs a week before Toronto) like McQueen’s previous feature, 12 Years a Slave, as may If Beale Street Could Talk, Barry Jenkins’ follow-up to the Oscar winning Moonlight.Among the other world premiere screenings are High Life, a science-fiction thriller about a group of convicts sent into space, directed by Claire Denis and starring Robert Pattinson the Emilio Estevez-directed The Public, about a sit-in at a library, and Michael Winterbottom’s India-set The Wedding Guest, starring Dev Patel.Toronto has also avoided the conflict with the streaming giants that dogged Cannes earlier in the year. The gala section has two films from Netflix – The Land of Steady Habits, a drama about a retiree who decides to ditch his family, starring Ben Mendelsohn and Edie Falco, and The Kindergarten Teacher, the American remake of an Israeli film about a precocious pre-schooler and his teacher – and two from Amazon – the aforementioned Beautiful Boy and Life Itself, a Spanish-American family drama starring Oscar Isaac.The special presentations lineup contains a string of much-lauded films already premiered elsewhere, such as the Paweł Pawlikowski 1940s-set romance Cold War, Nadine Labaki’s fable of Lebanese child anger Capernaum, Hirokazu Kore-eda’s family-thief drama Shoplifters, and the Colette biopic starring Keira Knightley. Toronto is also likely to see the North American premieres of a number of heralded but as-yet unseen films: Sunset, the Hungarian drama from Sun of Saul director László Nemes Maya, from Things to Come’s Mia Hansen-Løve, and The Sisters Brothers, the first English-language film from Rust and Bone’s Jacques Audiard. Also screening will be the much delayed White Boy Rick, the informer thriller directed by ’71’s Yann Demange, and Where Hands Touch, a wartime romance from A United Kingdom’s Amma Asante, and also starring Stenberg.• The Toronto international film festival runs from 6 to 16 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6d84003b3e920e34fb9875e1d16edde0fbf4d88/56_0_1665_999/master/1665.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa7bf77fa72bb52b6d96403184d00f15","title":"mike leigh peterloo first trailer for the drama about the 19th century massacre","story":"Mike Leigh follows Mr Turner with another period film, about the killing of protesters in Manchester in 1819 that led to the founding of the The first trailer for Peterloo, Mike Leigh’s dramatisation of the bloody 1819 “Peterloo massacre” in Manchester that resulted in 15 deaths, has been released on the internet.The film arrives in the run-up to the 200th anniversary of this foundational event in modern British political history, which was the result of a cavalry detachment charging into a 60,000-strong crowd in Manchester’s St Peter’s Fields to hear speeches demanding parliamentary reform.

It could be gamechanging for both film producers and audiences, said Ganna Pogrebna, a professor of behavioural economics and data science at the University of Birmingham, who led the research team. “We know that when we talk about movie production it is a small group of people that make decisions for the viewers. We were essentially trying to listen to the viewer, to see what they actually want.”The scientists categorised the movies according to six emotional profiles or clusters, which were previously applied to novels.These are: rags to riches – an ongoing emotional rise as seen in films such as The Shawshank Redemption riches to rags – an ongoing emotional fall (Psycho) man in a hole – a fall followed by a rise (The Godfather) Icarus – a rise followed by a fall (On the Waterfront) Cinderella – a rise followed by a fall followed by a rise (Babe) and Oedipus, a fall followed by a rise followed by a fall (All About My Mother).They were able to then map the clusters that were most successful at the box office across 21 genres.The analysis showed that man in a hole movies with their happy-sad-happy trajectory were the most financially successful movies across all genres, costing an average of $40.5m to produce and earning an average of $54.9m.For biographical films, rags to riches came out on top, but it was far less successful in mysteries and thrillers. For comedies the riches to rags arc, which allows for a sad ending, was by far the least successful. The researchers found that man in a hole films were not the most liked but they were likely to be the most talked about.The research has been published by Cornell University Library, titled: The data science of Hollywood: Using emotional arcs of movies to drive business model innovation in entertainment industries.Pogbrena said the research findings were multi-dimensional. For example, riches to rags movies could be financially successful if they were epic and made with a huge budget, such as Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies Icarus films are most successful with a low budget and Oedipus films do not do well at awards ceremonies.Pogbrena said the team was not saying only man in a hole movies should be made. “We are not trying to kill the film industry,” she said. “We are trying to see what is successful.”The researchers gathered their data from a range of public sources including scripts on opensubtitles.org, revenues from the-numbers and audience satisfaction ratings from IMDb.Pogbrena hopes the academic research will help film companies be more creative, because if they know what will be commercially successful it could give them security to widen their portfolio to produce more experimental movies.“I don’t see it as limiting, it could allow companies to be more inventive,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee0c7117cc10fb48d5a5e1b1426c7f5539fdd85f/0_128_2618_1571/master/2618.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d0c94660f3c4fab57e5a2c3d4cb321b","title":"adam lallana england world cup squad right call liverpool","story":"• Gareth Southgate did not select Lallana due to injury issues• Liverpool midfielder ‘feeling good’ ahead of new campaignAdam Lallana has spoken of his frustration at missing the World Cup but accepts Gareth Southgate made “probably the right call” when omitting him from the England squad.The 30-year-old Liverpool midfielder made the standby list for Russia after an injury-plagued season restricted him to three starts in all competitions for Jürgen Klopp’s team.

The Spaniard also said that the club may consider legal action.He added that the Bordeaux president, Stéphane Martin, insisted on releasing a statement confirming the deal, and that Roma were “forced” to follow suit. He then claimed that after Barcelona submitted a higher offer, Bordeaux refused to let the player travel to Rome.Monchi also stated that Roma made a new offer, but ended negotiations when asked to increase it further, “because we don’t want a bidding war.”Malcom, who can play as a winger or attacking midfielder, will undergo a medical on Wednesday but has already been announced by the club as their third signing of the summer.The Spanish champions have also brought in central midfielder Arthur from Grêmio for a reported £35.5m, and French defender Clément Lenglet from Sevilla for £31m.Malcom began his career with Corinthians and was part of the Campeonato title winning side of 2015 before moving to France in January 2016.He spent three seasons with Bordeaux, scoring 23 goals in 96 appearances, and is yet to represent Brazil at senior level.Roma have moved to quickly put the disappointment of missing out on Malcom behind them, announcing the arrival of Sweden international goalkeeper Robin Olsen for an initial €8.5m (£7.6m) fee.Olsen, who impressed with his performances as Sweden reached the World Cup quarter-finals, arrives from FC Copenhagen on a five-year contract.

He carries a $10m (£7.6m) bounty on his head.Bano is contesting Wednesday’s election in Pakistan for the Allah O Akbar Tehreek (AAT) party, a new political wing with links to Jamaat-ud-Dawa and the Milli Muslim League, which is on the UN’s list of banned organisations.Saeed may not be standing for office in Lahore, but his face is on all the Allah O Akbar posters and he remains an inspiration for his followers.However, most political parties, especially religious ones, are fielding their female candidates in seats they are sure to lose. Bano, who is related to the wife of Sharif, jailed earlier this month for corruption, knows winning is a long shot. But she believes Saeed and his party will consult women like her on policy matters. At least Bano is being encouraged to campaign. In Peshawar, capital of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the country’s north-west, where women are seldom seen in public areas, Tehreek Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah, another hardline Islamist party, is fielding a female candidate for the national assembly yet none of its leaders have ever met her.Labbaik was formed last year by a fiery cleric and promises to enforce stricter laws against blasphemy. The party’s participation in the elections follows a decision by Pakistan’s army to “mainstream” religious extremists.In Peshawar no one seems to know “Ms Yasmeen”, the candidate without a last name and without a face – the space is left blank on campaign posters. When asked about her whereabouts, a male candidate from the party also contesting a seat for Peshawar holds a finger to his lips and says in a hushed voice: “She is a silent candidate. We gave her name to fulfil the requirements of the election commission, but she will not campaign. She is a pious lady and never steps out of her house or talks to journalists.”It is not just the extremist Islamist parties that are fielding female candidates in seats they cannot win. Mainstream political parties, like Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-N, are doing the same.Sobia Shahid is standing for the party in Lower Dir, a rural area, also in the north-west, where all the political parties had previously made a written agreement not to allow women to vote. “Despite the fact that men get women to do all their work at home, during elections they don’t find them capable to vote and ban them from doing so,” says Shahid. “Someone has to stand against this injustice.”She says that by tradition women don’t go to funerals – which local politicians are expected to attend – and are not present at tribal councils, making it harder to reach voters. But apart from some sexist statements by her male opponents, she says that male voters have been receptive.“Surprisingly I have never been discouraged by male voters because they are so happy to see their representative and are eager to share their problems, in the hope that we can resolve them.”Women don’t come to political rallies, so Shahid is running a door-to-door campaign. She complains that most women do not have an official identity card, which means they cannot cast a vote.Asma Alamgir Khan, from a well-established political family in Peshawar, is able to spend big money on her campaign for the Pakistan People’s party, led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, son of the assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. She is seen as one of the few female candidates who has a chance of winning.“The new law is a step forward for women. We are now in the political fray and at least the tradition of silence has been broken,” says Khan, standing among a crowd of men."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f19ac2e0d7432e58f4e430c84c1dfe27997e75f/440_10_5320_3192/master/5320.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dc5c5bb0132ee222abe41250f361e59","title":"stigma struggles living with disability kakuma kenya in pictures","story":"As the first ever international disability summit begins in London, photographer Kate Holt reports from Kakuma refugee camp in northern Kenya, sharing the stories of refugees and locals who live and cope with disabilities in the most hostile of environments "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb0c30cedc7f1e894e44e2c67a7dead4c6ce275c/0_16_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c58d9bd7666e93ae034b18df88e519a4","title":"lifetime isa legal and survey fees lose bonus","story":"I am unsure whether I will lose the bonus by withdrawing funds from itQ I’m a first-time buyer in the process of buying a flat with a value of £130,000.

My question is – can the amount in the Isa solely be used for the deposit payment, or can I also use it for legal and survey fees during the purchase without forgoing any of the bonus?If it’s the latter, it would be worth me transferring another £1,000 into the account to maximise the further £250 bonus available this tax year.

As to whether it would be a good idea, it depends on whether you need the £1,000 for your legal and survey fees.So you are right, to avoid a penalty on your withdrawal – which your lifetime Isa manager is required to pay directly to your conveyancer or solicitor rather than to you – all of it must be used for the deposit.You wouldn’t have been able to use any lifetime Isa money to pay stamp duty either.

It must then be passed before 29 March 2019, so the withdrawal agreement has legal effect.What did we learn from the white paper?Dominic Raab, the new Brexit secretary, reiterated his warning the UK could withhold the £39bn final settlement if the EU fails to agree a trade deal. He also said there would be “no wholesale removal of rights of EU nationals” if there was no deal. He also said the implementation bill would reinstate parts of the European Communities Act – which first took the UK into the then common market – which is being repealed by the EU Withdrawal Act, so EU law can still apply during the transition.“Both of us will be supported by the Cabinet Office Europe Unit and with this in mind the Europe Unit will have overall responsibility for the preparation and conduct of the negotiations, drawing upon support from DExEU and other departments as required.”Robbins, appearing alongside Raab at the Commons’ Brexit committee, said: “The overall strategy for the conduct of these negotiations, she regards very much as her personal responsibility, now with the secretary of state very close at hand.”Raab described the changes as a “shifting of the Whitehall deckchairs” and said there would now be “one team, one chain of command” but pointed out that there would be “full assertion of ministerial accountability”.He added: “We’ve been very clear – there’s no tension between us, I think that’s clear – that all the advice and all the meetings will be attended by me with the PM and all the advice will come to me.”The former cabinet minister John Whittingdale, a Brexiter, suggested that Raab and Robbins should swap roles, as the civil servant was “clearly in charge”, a suggestion that the Brexit secretary denied. Jenny Chapman, the shadow Brexit minister, said: “Dominic Raab has been sidelined by the prime minister before he has even had the change to get his feet under the table.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f584caf2a6fa1ef18d0625b9de1a53a839f6922f/0_190_5408_3245/master/5408.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eedfe812d5f94d32ffa576d42f298c0d","title":"contingencies planned to ensure uks post brexit food supply says raab","story":"Government not stockpiling food but working to prevent problems, says Brexit secretaryBrexit secretary Dominic Raab has admitted that the government will have to take steps to ensure that there are adequate food supplies for Britain to cover the eventuality of a no-deal departure from the European Union.In testimony to the Brexit select committee on Tuesday, the minister dismissed claims that the government was stockpiling provisions. However, he acknowledged that it would work with the food industry to ensure that a no-deal outcome would not disrupt supply.“We will look at this issue in the round and make sure that there’s adequate food supplies,” Raab told the Brexit select committee. “It would be wrong to describe it as the government doing the stockpiling... Of course the idea that we only get food imports into this country from one continent is not appropriate.”While Raab emphasised that he viewed the risk of disruption to food supplies as minimal, his description of the government’s contingency planning will alarm those who fear that the UK will crash out of the EU without a deal.His admission follows Theresa May’s instruction that no-deal planning be stepped up after the Chequers summit, in part to show Brussels she was serious about leaving without a deal. The chancellor has already set aside £3bn for contingency planning.Also on Tuesday, health secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that the Department of Health and Social Care is working with industry to stockpile drugs, medical devices and supplies, with the focus on medicines with a short shelf-life that may need to be flown in if there is disruption at British ports.“We are working right across government to ensure that the health sector and the industry are prepared and that people’s health will be safeguarded in the event of a no-deal Brexit,” Hancock said.He said he was “confident” that a deal could be reached but added that it was “responsible” to prepare for a range of outcomes. Over the coming weeks, the government will unveil around 70 other contingency measures issuing advice, some of it likely to be alarming, to households and businesses on how to prepare for crashing out.The UK is hoping to reach a deal with Brussels on withdrawal by October, but the compromise proposals agreed by the cabinet are so far finding little support in Brussels or in parliament, increasing the likelihood of leaving without a deal. Transport officials are considering transforming the M26 in Kent into a lorry park for hundreds of HGVs to help cope with tailbacks from the port of Dover when up to 10,000 lorries a day suddenly need customs checks to enter the EU. There have also been suggestions that the Ministry of Defence has been looking into how the armed forces could be deployed to carry out various civil functions, including using RAF jets to transport food supplies across the country. Last week, Amazon became the latest in a growing list of businesses to express its concerns, when its UK boss warned the Brexit secretary that Britain would face “civil unrest” within weeks of leaving the EU without a deal. During sometimes terse questioning from MPs, Raab admitted there were some risks in the short-term from leaving without a deal but that the UK had “huge amounts going for it” and its “best days lie ahead”.He told MPs: “I’m not quite as pessimistic as some others, when I look to the medium and longterm. There’s no doubt that we would have to look at the uncertainty that we’d face in the short-term. “I’m not going to wallow in pessimism about the state of this country in relation to Brexit. We’re going to go into these negotiations with economic confidence and political ambition. I’m not going to allow us to be cowed in a corner afraid of our own shadow.”Raab said that he would not “drip feed” information on planning for a no-deal Brexit but would instead rely on the series of technical notices over the summer to explain what the government was doing to mitigate risks to households and business.Brexit minister Martin Callanan was dismissive of food stockpiling claims: “It seems to me to be a fairly ridiculous scare story. There are many countries outside of the European Union that manage to feed their citizens perfectly satisfactorily without the benefit of EU processes.”What is the withdrawal and implementation bill?Officially known as the European Union (withdrawal agreement) bill, this will be the primary piece of legislation to enact the agreement the UK secures to leave the EU, and the ensuing transition period.What will it cover?That depends on what the final deal is. A white paper published on Tuesday mainly takes in areas already dealt with by the initial agreement with the EU – reciprocal citizens’ rights, the transition period, and the orce bill.When will the bill be introduced?Only after parliament has approved the deal negotiated with the EU.

He also said there would be “no wholesale removal of rights of EU nationals” if there was no deal. He also said the implementation bill would reinstate parts of the European Communities Act – which first took the UK into the then common market – which is being repealed by the EU Withdrawal Act, so EU law can still apply during the transition.However, a cross-party business committee warned last month that failure to secure a free trade deal with the EU would be “disastrous” for Britain’s £28bn processed food and drink industry, while reverting to World Trade Organisation rules would have a “seismic” impact on the UK’s largest manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, the government sought to reassure businesses, universities and local organisations that any funding they secure through the EU, until the end of 2020, will be guaranteed by the government in the event of a no deal.Just hours after the government published its white paper on withdrawing from the EU, and as Raab appeared in front of the MPs, May announced she was taking back control of negotiations with Brussels from her new Brexit secretary.May said she would now lead the crunch talks with the EU while Raab, who was appointed two weeks ago, would be left in charge of domestic preparations, no-deal planning and legislation.The move was swiftly characterised as a “sidelining” of the Brexit secretary by No 10’s Europe unit, led by May’s chief Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, with the prime minister also taking fewer than 50 officials from his department.Raab described the move as a “shifting of the Whitehall deckchairs” but said it was primarily about establishing “one team, one chain of command”.The Brexit secretary confirmed the government was prepared to make further concessions to reach a final deal – but warned there were limits to what the UK would accept and stressed the EU should take the offer seriously.“Of course it’s a negotiation, there’s no point saying there isn’t,” he said. “It would be too crude to say ‘meets the EU halfway’ but certainly is mindful of the considerations they have got.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b7881cbca3f1f9ba9a10b728204f71ff5a08bae/0_28_1682_1009/master/1682.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=513b8f43760354be425557cdab22b96e","title":"it dawns on raab hes now below the four pot plants in the food chain","story":"Brexit secretary didn’t initially seem aware of his demotion as he appeared before committeeMinutes after the prime minister had announced she was downgrading his Brexit department to little more than a Jobcentre Plus office for otherwise unemployable MPs, Dominic Raab found himself in front of the Brexit select committee.The news didn’t immediately appear to have been passed on to the new Brexit secretary who bounced into the room with the swagger of someone who was fairly confident he was a wee bit brighter than his predecessor. A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. Being one step ahead of David Davis is still being several steps behind everyone else.The committee chair, Hilary Benn, looked embarrassed to confront Raab with the realities of his demotion and began the session by treating him as if he was still a cabinet minister. A kindness. Could he explain why everyone but him and a few other hardline Brexiters thought that a no-deal outcome would be an economic disaster for the UK?He couldn’t. Raab is a natural middle manager who can’t quite believe he hasn’t been made chief executive, and started babbling nonsense he had picked up from the assertiveness training module on a company away day. Everyone else was wrong because they were wrong and he was right. There were too many people talking Britain down. What was needed was a bit of mindless cheerfulness. Or cheerful mindlessness.The more Raab tried to explain how well he had mastered his brief, the more depressed the members of the committee became. He could offer no real sector-by-sector analysis of the effect of not having a common rulebook for banking and services because, although the department might once have considered the economic impact, their findings had got locked in a cupboard and no one could find the key. But he did hope to publish 70 different sectoral no-deal reports some time over the next six months.Benn looked over his glasses. He wanted to check that Raab realised the UK was supposed to be close to finalising the negotiations in October. Wasn’t there a danger that some of the analysis would be published far too late to be of any use? Raab nodded his head enthusiastically. He certainly hoped so. That way no one would ever bother to read them and find out they had never been of any value.There was one piece of good news, though. Raab was delighted to report that a few out-of-date tins of John West tuna had been stockpiled in Felixstowe so there were adequate supplies of food for at least a few days in the event of no deal. And in any case, everyone would be so thrilled that Brexit might turn out to be a tremendous success in 50 years’ time or so that they wouldn’t mind starving to death while they waited.At this point, the committee could no longer delay the inevitable. Someone had to point out to Raab that he was a minister in name only and that it was Theresa May and the man sitting next to him who were basically in charge. Raab was really there to carry the bags and put Post-it notes in the relevant pages of the files. The Tory John Whittingdale volunteered to take one for the team and put him right.“Aren’t you in effect the minister?” he said to Olly Robbins, the top civil servant who is the only person Theresa May believes has an outside chance of negotiating the least damaging deal for the UK.“Oh no,” said Robbins urbanely. He was far more powerful than that. Please don’t confuse him with a common or garden cabinet minister who knew next to nothing. About anything. Robbins then went on to talk the committee through the Chequers deal. It was completely untrue that the cabinet hadn’t been informed of the second white paper that he had written. Not that it was a white paper or that he had written it. Rather it had mysteriously appeared out of the ether and ministers had failed to notice it.By now, it had finally dawned on Raab that he was nothing more than a glorified bag carrier. And he didn’t like it. “We are one team and there is one chain of command,” he snapped, his back ramrod straight. Indeed there was a chain of command. And he was right at the bottom of it. Below the prime minister. Below Robbins. Below even the Four Pot Plants.“There, there,” said Robbins soothingly as they left together. “If you play your cards right, you’re definitely in with a shout of winning ‘most improved manager of the month’ at the south-west regional awards dinner.” Because he’s worth it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4916076fcc744963809f30738296f8369d23dcce/0_316_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82effc5845c0035014b7215ee71877e6","title":"pictish coppersmith 1000 year old handprint found in orkney","story":"Metalworker would have plied his trade from small, half-buried circular stone structure, say archaeologistsThe grimy handprint of a sweaty metalworker and the smeared track of his dirty knees have been uncovered by archaeologists more than 1,000 years after the fires went out in his copper workshop on an island in Orkney.It would have been a hot, uncomfortable workspace: a small circular stone structure, half underground, in a substantial Pictish settlement on the island of Rousay. Archaeologists are racing against the tides, which are gradually eroding the surviving structures, to save as much evidence as possible.Stephen Dockrill, senior lecturer in archaeology at the University of Bradford, is joint leader of an excavation by staff and students working with archaeologists from the City University of New York. Dockrill said the discovery of such humbly human evidence of the structure’s former occupier took them by surprise. “Analysis of crucible fragments and the floor deposits demonstrated that a coppersmith worked in the building,” Dockrill said. “The analysis of the floor enables us to say with confidence where the smith worked, next to a hearth and two stone anvils. The biggest surprise came when we lifted the larger stone anvil and cleaned it we could see carbon imprints of the smith’s knees and hands.”Julie Bond, joint director of the excavation, said such personal evidence was an exciting discovery: “We are doing all we can to gather as much information on the site before it is destroyed by the sea. A handprint is so personal and inidual that you can almost feel the presence of the coppersmith and imagine what it must have been like working in there all those years ago.”The building has been dated to between the sixth and ninth centuries, but analysis of the soot may reveal more evidence of date and the materials he was working with.The coppersmith would have been almost in darkness apart from the light from his hearth. The building was reached by steps and a curving passageway, and closed off by a door: the pivot stone, door jamb and bar hole were all found intact, together with a stone set upright to protect the hearth from draughts.  The workshop was Pictish, built by a people renowned for their beautiful metalwork and stone carving. The archaeologists believe the space was deliberately darkened to enable the coppersmith to judge the state of the metal by its colour – but as the traces he left prove, it was dirty work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc20960f8957285e3acdfb0626861579e427d767/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25636af9a9c1db1a371950f3ede0eb70","title":"irelands ancient east experience its beauty on a budget","story":"With burial mounds dating back to 3,200BC, medieval castles, and centuries-old pubs, the east of Ireland is brimming with history. But you don’t need to break the bank to discover its richesIt’s no surprise that Ireland’s Ancient East casts a powerful spell over travellers. Think more than 5,000 years of history, spectacular natural scenery, dramatic ancient ruins and a rich local culture all framed by the majestic River Shannon and the rugged coastline of the Irish Sea. And, unlike many European destinations, Ireland really is a country where the best things in life are free … or, in the case of a perfect pint in a centuries-old Kilkenny pub, less than a fiver.For travellers on a budget, driving is easily the cheapest and most rewarding way to get around the country, and Ireland is a land that richly rewards travellers who get off the beaten track. Highlights for most visitors tend to be the places and faces they discover along the way that impromptu folk session in a tiny village pub, the local artist who invites them into the studio for tea, a deserted stretch of golden sand at sunrise. This makes Ireland a nation with plenty to offer visitors on a budget, particularly given that Irish Ferries services start from £79 per car – meaning that taking your car on holiday is easily the cheapest way to drive the Emerald Isle.This is an island fond of a good yarn, full of myths and legends about the epic adventures of heroes and villains, knights, kings, monks, Vikings, Celts and feuding family dynasties. Get a whole lot of history for €8 (£7) at County Kildare’s Castletown House, Ireland’s largest Palladian manor. Built for the wildly wealthy (and morally dubious) politician William Conolly, who rose from humble origins to own some 100,000 acres of land, Castletown became a symbol of his great wealth and makes for a fascinating introduction to Georgian architecture and design. Also in Kildare is the National Stud and Gardens visitors can take a guided tour of the farm and catch a glimpse of one of the equine sporting legends who call it home, such as the now-retired Hurricane Fly, one of the best hurdlers of all time. There’s also a world-renowned Japanese garden and Kids Zone to explore.To the north, in County Meath, you’ll find Newgrange, a dramatic passage tomb dating back to 3,200BC that predates the Egyptian pyramids. Mystery surrounds this large circular mound with an inner stone passageway and chambers at dawn on the winter solstice, a shaft of light from the sunrise illuminates the stone burial chamber, hinting at Newgrange’s religious significance in the past.History is never off the menu in Ireland and simply wandering the narrow lanes of Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile is a swift way to get to the heart of Ireland’s medieval capital, with Kilkenny Castle, St Canice’s Cathedral and Rothe House all in a compact quarter.No trip to Ireland is complete without nourishing the body as well as the soul, and, happily, Ireland’s Ancient East offers countless low-cost culinary delights. Ireland’s gastronomic scene is currently enjoying a resurgence, with exciting young chefs honing their craft overseas before returning to their homeland to launch pioneering new restaurants and pop-ups. The quaint harbour town of Dungarvan is a good place to start, perched at the mouth of the River Colligan in County Waterford and lorded over by the Comeragh mountains. Regular farmers’ markets and fairs showcase local suppliers, while chef Paul Flynn’s fine dining Tannery Restaurant offers a pleasingly affordable bite of Ireland. The multi-course €35 set menu is a particularly good deal.A more casual feast can be had at Foodworks in Kilkenny, which features a rotating menu of mostly local ingredients such as Irish venison, 21-day dry-aged Hereford steak and home-reared pork. Foodworks makes a particularly great feeding station before a tour of Kilkenny’s Smithwick’s brewery, which charts the 300-year heritage of Irish ale in beautiful Victorian premises.For classic Irish pub grub, make for Kyteler’s Inn in the heart of Kilkenny, where chef Margaret Kelly serves a poshed-up version of gamey Irish stew alongside plenty of beer on tap – while the occasional impromptu music session takes place in the corner. A highlight for road-tripping visitors in Ireland is the wide variety of affordable accommodation on offer, from historic village inns to grand Georgian country house estates. Springview Farmhouse was named Irish B\u0026ampB of the Year in 2017, and with prices starting from €30, this late 18th-century home, set in a working farm in County Kilkenny, makes a great budget option. Woodenbridge hotel \u0026amp lodge in the Vale of Avoca, County Wicklow, claims to be the oldest hotel in Ireland, dating back to 1608. With beautifully landscaped gardens overlooking the serene Aughrim River, just 44 miles from Dublin, it makes a great base for exploring Ireland’s Ancient East.Meanwhile, Finnstown Castle hotel is an ivy-strewn Georgian manor house set in a 45-acre estate. But don’t let the imposing architecture and grandness of the rooms fool you the pub and restaurant are beloved local haunts, making for a reliably convivial atmosphere.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

By Anna HartMain image: Durrow Viaduct, part of Waterford Greenway (Getty)Few European destinations are as culturally and historically rich as Ireland’s Ancient East, making it perfect road-trip material for travellers who crave experiences beyond the ordinary. Thanks to ferry connections at Dublin and Rosslare, it’s easy to bring your own car over from Great Britain, opening up a wealth of glorious drives through undulating hills and ancient forests. Add in stop-offs at prehistoric burial sites, spellbinding castles and characterful country pubs and it’s easy to understand why Ireland’s Ancient East is climbing to the top of the must-do lists of intrepid travellers. Here’s what not to miss …Binge on natural scenery Get a brand new profile pic at Powerscourt waterfall at the foot of the Wicklow mountains, Ireland’s highest cascade at 121 metres. It’s a scenic three-mile drive through the ancient forests of the Powerscourt estate – and look out for the giant sequoia. In Wicklow, charter boats leave regularly on dolphin-watching trips, which also showcase scenic and historic spots from a sea-based vantage point. If you’re feeling active, hire bikes and cycle the Waterford Greenway, a 28-mile bike route that traces a former rail track between Waterford and Dungarvan.Culture and creativity  For such a small nation, Ireland has a rich heritage of craft and design. The National Craft Gallery in Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile (which forms part of the Kilkenny Craft Trail) serves as a useful introduction to the Irish traditions of jewellery making, pottery, weaving and other cottage industries. The stable block at Kilkenny Castle is a working gallery and studio space, where you might catch young potters at the wheel, or meet other makers and producers.Exploring Ireland’s Ancient East by car immediately immerses you in some 5,000 years of history. Start with the Boyne valley, where you’ll find ancient burial mounds at Newgrange, Dowth and Knowth (which comprise the Brú na Bóinne Unesco world heritage site). Slane Castle and Slane Castle Distillery are worth a tour, but don’t miss Trim Castle, Ireland’s largest Anglo-Norman castle. Ireland is a country where myths and legends merge into history, and you’ll definitely want to make a pilgrimage to medieval Blarney Castle to kiss the Blarney Stone, which bestows “the gift of the gab” on all who climb the steps to press their lips upon it.Bed down in a country house hotel One of the chief pleasures of an Irish road trip is the array of elegant country house hotels to choose from, often at refreshingly affordable prices. The elegant Athenaeum House hotel in Waterford is a superb choice, a canary-yellow Georgian manor on the banks of the River Suir. In Clonmel in County Tipperary, stylish digs are found at Hotel Minella, another Georgian architectural triumph, dating back to 1863. And less than an hour from Dublin, just outside Naas, sits the stately Victorian Killashee hotel and spa, with views over the Wicklow mountains and the Kildare countryside. Irish Ferries offers three nights at the Hotel Minella with return cruise ferry for two adults and their own car, from £180 each £228 each for the Athenaeum House hotel or £226 for the Killashee hotel and spa.

In 2017, Donegal even topped National Geographic’s list of the coolest places on the planet. Anna Hart rounds up the 10 best things to do on a Donegal road trip Ireland’s most rugged and ravishing county has been a much-loved retreat for artists, bohemians, outdoorsy types and holidaying families for decades, but it’s only now that the rest of the world is waking up to the charms of traversing Donegal by car. Dramatic, secluded beaches, craggy coastlines, soaring peaks, shimmering lakes, verdant valleys and time-warp harbours – all dotted with atmospheric country pubs and quaint seafood restaurants – recently propelled this north-west county to the top of National Geographic Traveller’s Cool List. “It’s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone’s throw away,” says National Geographic Traveller editor Pat Riddell. “And it is wilderness – world-class wilderness.” It’s definitely the coolest place on the planet right now if you’re a Star Wars fan. The region’s Inishowen peninsula was spectacularly showcased in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, with Malin Head being used to represent bits of Luke Skywalker’s isolated retreat, planet Ahch-To. This only added to the buzz around this long-overlooked corner of Ireland, further embellishing its hip credentials and making it the stuff of road-trip dreams. If you’re taking your car to Ireland by ferry to explore the attractions of Donegal, make sure you hop out at the following must-do spots.Sink a pint at McGrory’sUnassuming but atmospheric, 1920s family-run McGrory’s hotel in Culdaff has long been a local favourite, thanks to its open fires, a dazzling range of Irish craft beers and traditional music sessions. So much so that Daisy Ridley and the Star Wars crew had a night out there around filming, leading to a steady stream of Star Wars-struck visitors. Making the most of the welcoming atmosphere and seafood-heavy menu is now even more of a must.Swap four wheels for two While Donegal rewards road-trippers with sublime coastal scenery, isolated castles, private estates and ancient forests, it’s also a great spot to jump on a bike and blast some of that Atlantic sea breeze into your lungs. The peninsula at Horn Head, forming part of Sheephaven Bay, is perhaps the most scenic of all the Donegal peninsulas, where the cliffs rise to 180 metres (600ft) on the ocean side and provide breeding grounds for seabirds such as the European shag and razorbill. The Hornhead loop can be walked or driven, but biking is the best way to drink it all in, speeding past quartzite cliffs, mud flats, dunes and the salty New Lake area, complete with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean.Scale Mount ErrigalThe stark, striking quartzite mass of 751-metre Mount Errigal looms as you head east on the N56 from Gweedore. This is the tallest peak in County Donegal, and along with Mweelrea, is considered one of the most satisfying climbs in the county. Alternatively, drive to the coast and take a bracing walk at the highest sea cliffs in Europe – Slieve League. They stretch 600 metres (2,000ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at the highest point, with impressive views of the rugged coastline and Donegal Bay. Lose yourself in Letterkenny With a population of nearly 20,000, Letterkenny is Donegal’s most populous town, a confident and vibrant former market town famous for gothic-style St Eunan’s Cathedral – and its Hindu temple too. Donegal County Museum, housed in a 19th-century workhouse building, is a great place to get clued up on the county’s former industrial history, and, just south-west of town, the Newmills Corn and Flax Mills have a huge working waterwheel powered by the River Swilly.Picnic at Glenevin waterfallGlenevin waterfall is found at the top of a short hike of just over a mile through the woods in Clonmany, with nicely landscaped picnic areas, footbridges and stepping stones adding to the magic of this beautiful spot. Stock up on sandwiches, quiches and sweet treats at Claire The Bakers in Carndonagh beforehand.Explore Malin Head on the Inishowen peninsulaMalin Head, Ireland’s most northerly point, offers spectacular views, and the northernmost tip, Banba’s Crown, is one of the most photographed spots in the county. Sip a flat white from the Caffe Banba coffee truck (which also has a standalone cafe in Carndonagh) and see if you can spot scenery that made an appearance in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.Take a trip to Tory IslandTory Island, just 8.5 miles off the mainland, is an island steeped in history and folklore, where Irish is spoken and the locals elect a king, who acts as the community spokesperson. Seventy-four-year-old musician Patsy Dan Rodgers has been king for two decades now, ruling over this island of 150 inhabitants, a single road, one church, one grocery store, one lighthouse, one hostel and a social club.Surf the AtlanticThe Wild Atlantic Way is studded by tiny surf towns and beaches that have become legendary among the European surf community. Bundoran is widely considered one of the best surfing spots in Europe, and is fantastic for all kinds of water sports and horseshoe-shaped Magheraroarty Strand and sand dune-backed Ballyhiernan Bay are both suitable for windsurfing and surfing. Beginners can get to grips with the sport at Inishowen, which has some of the most consistent waves in Ireland, due to its exposure to rolling swells. Its long stretches of golden sandy beaches make for safe surfing conditions and a pleasant environment for newbies.Cook your catchCatch and cook your own dinner on a fishing trip with An Duanai Mara Boat Charters, based in the fishing town of Killybegs. On these deep-sea angling trips (combined with sightseeing trips around Donegal Bay), you’ll have the chance to reel in a cod, ling or turbot, watch the skipper fillet it, and then feast on it at nearby Kitty Kelly’s restaurant.Hike Glenveagh national parkGlenveagh national park is one of six in Ireland, encompassing some 16,000 hectares in the heart of the Derryveagh mountains. These lands were managed as a private deer forest before becoming a national park in 1975, and this is now bona fide wilderness, home to a lot of indigenous wildlife and rare plant species.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

But Dad’s Army became a TV phenomenon. We reveal how the Walmington warriors seized victoryTo explore the history of Dad’s Army, you have to enter a near-military environment. Speed bumps, vehicle checks and CCTV impede the route to the building in Caversham, Berkshire, where the paperwork about the show’s creation is stored. These levels of security are because the BBC Written Archives are housed on the grounds of BBC Monitoring, whose duties include listening to global media on behalf of MI6.But if the records of any TV show were to deserve such protective apparatus, it would be Dad’s Army, the BBC’s single most durably valuable programme. Next 31 July marks 50 years since the first episode was shown, while the last original show was screened in 1977 – but repeats still top the BBC Two ratings. The origins of this TV phenomenon are recorded in pink folders containing yellowed press cuttings, letters from viewers and internal memos typed on paper so flimsy the letter O sometimes goes right though like a bullet hole. The first documents trace the payment of £200 each to producer-director David Croft and co-writer Jimmy Perry for a script originally called The Fighting Tigers, based on the latter’s second world war experience in the Local Defence Volunteers, later called the Home Guard. Most successful British sitcoms have central characters unsuited to their profession: Basil Fawlty shouldn’t be running a hotel, Del Boy Trotter overestimates his commercial savvy, David Brent is a terrible boss. Dad’s Army set the template for this comedy of overconfident incompetents. Asked to defend Walmington-on-Sea while the real men are away, bank manager Captain Mainwaring acts out a fantasy of military command. Because the Home Guard included those too old and too young to be called up, the characters’ age-range was unusually wide: from 70-year-old Lance Corporal Jones, who has fought for the British empire in Sudan, to 17-year-old asthmatic Private Pike. The budget file for the first series shows that John Le Mesurier, as Sergeant Wilson, was initially regarded as the show’s star, and paid £209, nine shillings and sixpence, while Arthur Lowe as Mainwaring received £170 and 2 shillings. A letter from Michael Grade – later to run the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, but then a junior showbiz agent – agrees third billing and pay parity with Lowe for Clive Dunn, only 47 years old but looking twice that on screen as LCpl Jones. Ian Lavender, paid £51 and 19 shillings to play Pike, was only 22 at the time, which means he is now the only surviving member of the main cast. Lavender finds the lasting popularity of the series is “a continuous pleasant shock”. He thinks the main reason is that it was written to have universal appeal. “It surprises me that no one now seems to want to make programmes that all the family can watch,” he says. “Everything is so niche-driven: shops, films, TV. If I don’t like something, nobody cares because they say they weren’t aiming at me.” Although Dad’s Army is now regarded as the epitome of safe mainstream comedy – and often wielded as a corrective yardstick by those who find modern TV comedy too shocking – the show was considered controversial in 1968. Archived memos show that Paul Fox, controller of BBC One, was so concerned about potential offence to viewers who served in or were bereaved by the war, he ordered the removal of footage of Nazi troops and displaced refugees from the opening titles. This triggered a response from Michael Mills, BBC’s head of comedy, expressing “profound disquiet over your decision”, and complaining that the changes meant the show would no longer be able “to advance comedy output into new areas”. Fox tersely replied that he did not consider Dad’s Army to be “breakthrough territory”. Lavender says he only learned about these tensions through later books and documentaries. At the time, the cast was “unaware of any controversy”. When looking at the beginnings of a classic, the question is: “Did anyone realise?” With Dad’s Army, the TV critics mainly didn’t. Preserved in the Caversham files is the verdict of Peter Black of the Daily Mail, complaining that the first episode wasn’t “situation or character comedy, it’s only gag comedy, the easiest to write and the quickest wearing on the ear”. Michael Billington, now the ’s theatre critic but then covering TV for the Times, found the show to combine “bland sentiment and humour rather uneasily”. Yet one curling cutting in the file makes anyone who has worked as a reviewer want to stand and salute. In those days, critics phoned in reviews immediately after transmission. On that summer night 50 years ago, Ron Boyle of the  immediately declared Dad’s Army “a classic comedy series” that might even be “comedy’s finest half-hour”. The show quickly became a hit with the very audience the BBC had worried about: those with direct experience of the events it depicted. Soon after the first broadcast, a Home Guard veteran signing himself Private Huntley wrote to congratulate its makers, while many others sent in ideas (“a few funny things that happened in our village”). One even offered the loan of an “overcoat and battledress outfit”. Those early letters also reveal the cross-generational appeal that has been key to the series’ longevity. “Each of us in the house has a favourite actor,” writes a Miss Carruthers while a viewer from Helensburgh writes: “I watch with my teenage family. They know nothing of those daft days but they enjoy the programme just the same!” Five decades on, the same applies. By the third episode, screened on 14 August, the critics were catching up with public enthusiasm. The Western Mail called it “comedy of the very best sort, because it’s drawn from a rich fund of experience and not from the artificial hatching of a script conference”. As that insight suggests, the writer, Peter Tinniswood, was himself a comedy writer (I Didn’t Know You Cared, Tales from the Long Room). His review also makes a crucial point that had been overlooked by those making accusations of bad taste: he remembered the Home Guard being “a constant source of humour”. On 15 August, another distinguished comedy writer, Barry Took (The Army Game, Round the Horne) sent a note to Croft: “Dear David. I think Dad’s Army is one of the funniest shows I’ve ever seen. The scripts, casting and direction are absolutely great.”  Took’s professional eye had noted that, unusually, those three elements all involved Croft. Croft was what is now called a showrunner. That degree of inidual control can be clearly seen. As is common in British sitcom, Croft and Perry favoured catchphrases but, as director, Croft could ensure there was a double kick: first from Mainwaring’s “Stupid boy!” and then from Pike’s wounded reaction. The most famous line in the series – when a German PoW demands the young private’s name and Mainwaring snaps: “Don’t tell him, Pike!” – is funny not only verbally but also visually, due to Lavender’s panicked reaction. There was rarely time, however, to relish any particular moment, due to the pressure of studio recording. “We had a line to say,” says Lavender, “and it had to be right first time. No retakes. We were all like nervous kids as it approached, not wanting to be the one who cocked up!” Even as ratings rose, the BBC remained nervous about the show – an early episode was cancelled after the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. But the one persistent controversy is the feeling that Dad’s Army was spoiled by “the repeated gales of inane laughter from the unseen audience”, as one viewer put it. To such complaints, Croft politely replies that, because his main actors have stage backgrounds, live studio reaction helps them to time – and to have confidence in – the jokes. That calculation reveals Croft’s perfectionism. Croft’s thoughtfulness towards his performers was not always reciprocated. Memoirs have revealed that Lowe took such a dim view of the script, he would hide it behind the rehearsal room radiator, or leave it with his driver overnight because he wasn’t prepared to have it in his house. During the shooting of the first series, Le Mesurier told fellow drinkers in the BBC bar it was “going to be a complete disaster”. Lavender, though, says they kept their doubts from the rest of the cast. “I never heard either prophesying disaster, although that was a general characteristic of Le Mesurier’s humour.”Five decades on, Lavender still has the knitted scarf his character’s mother gave him to protect his weak chest while on parade. “I was accused in one newspaper of having nicked the idea of the scarf from Tom Baker’s Doctor Who,” he says. “I think simple research will show that we were first. Deeply upsetting!” Some actors can end up feeling resentful when a role comes to define them, but Lavender has no such reservations. “I feel immensely proud to have been part of the beast. We still watch it. Not every weekend but, if we’re in, yes. We do find it funny and endearing – a pleasant reminder of a gentler time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/544c73c921d7f6bf955ef0da40b91acea0333278/0_1728_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98378bb99c70bbc0ec99569bda63d2ed","title":"pen criticised for retaining anthony julius as trustee","story":"Family of murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia hit out at decision to keep libel lawyerThe board of English PEN, which campaigns to defend writers and freedom of speech, has decided to retain the libel lawyer Anthony Julius as a trustee.PEN was under pressure to cut ties with Julius and his firm, the libel specialist Mishcon de Reya, following protests by the family of the murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.The decision to retain Julius was condemned by Caruana Galizia’s sons. They said it was “wholly inconsistent” with PEN’s principles.The case has drawn attention to how wealthy iniduals can threaten costly legal action in the UK in an attempt to silence journalists .In May, Caruana Galizia’s family accused Mishcon of seeking to “cripple” the journalist financially, and called for Julius to step down from PEN, saying his presence on its board was causing “reputational damage”.The charity’s trustees launched an investigation, which reviewed Mishcon’s correspondence with Caruana Galizia and two other complaints about letters the firm had written, on behalf of separate clients, to the London newspaper the Ham \u0026amp High, and to a journalist at the Observer.In a statement, PEN said its board had “concluded that the material put before it does not support the claims that have been reported or made in this particular case”. It said there was “no reason to invite Anthony Julius to step down as a trustee”.However, PEN acknowledged the case had brought to light issues on which it would seek to campaign.It pointed to “growing challenges faced by media outlets and journalists in the UK and internationally from law firms seeking to chill investigations, and manage reputations of wealthy clients, at a time when an increasing number of complex and politically important investigations are conducted by independent reporters.”Last year, shortly before her death, Caruana Galizia received letters from Mishcon asking for some of her blogposts to be deleted because they were “actionable in the high court of England and Wales”. The vast majority of readers of her Running Commentary website were based in Malta.In response, Caruana Galizia made corrections to her articles and the correspondence with Mishcon ceased. Mishcon said under EU law, a complainant can bring defamation proceedings either in the state where the publisher was based, which allows them to claim for damages to their reputation worldwide, or in any EU state where damage was suffered, in which case the payout relates only to harm caused in that country.Julius, who is deputy chairman at Mishcon, rose to prominence as the orce lawyer for Diana, Princess of Wales. He was appointed to PEN in December.He told the : “I defend English PEN and support the invaluable work they do both here in the UK and internationally. I welcome the thorough investigation which my fellow trustees have undertaken.“PEN is committed to addressing through open dialogue with journalists, lawyers and freedom of expression groups, the wider, more complex set of issues which the investigation has disclosed. I look forward to participating in this dialogue as a PEN trustee.”His fellow board members will now review the way in which they work with law firms. Mishcon has provided unpaid support to English PEN, helping draft a response to the Leveson inquiry into press regulation, and giving immigration advice to writers facing persecution in Turkey and elsewhere.The organisation’s board also includes the media lawyer Geraldine Proudler, a former member of the Scott Trust, which overseas the  and Observer.In a statement, Caruana Galizia’s sons, Matthew, Andrew and Paul said legal threats to journalists of the kind experienced by their mother was “wholly inconsistent with English PEN’s principles”.“It’s disappointing that English PEN have decided to support Mishcon instead of journalism. This has never been about our mother’s case as an isolated incident or about Anthony Julius as an isolated actor.“Neither has this been about working with lawyers in general: there are brilliant lawyers who, at a great cost to themselves, fight for the rights of journalists and writers.”PEN is a federation, with over 150 autonomous centres around the world. In a statement released Tuesday leaders of their umbrella organisation, PEN International, expressed support for Caruana Galizia’s sons and sought to distance themselves from the decision on Julius.“At this time, we need to emphasize that sometimes PEN centres take positions that are at variance with PEN ideals,” said Salil Tripathi, who chairs the group’s international writers in prison committee. “Each PEN centre has full autonomy and their respective boards take decisions based on local realities the positions they take do not necessarily reflect PEN International’s positions, or those of other centres.”"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Greece wildfires a \u0026#39Biblical disaster\u0026#39: At least 74 killed near Athens as tourists forced to flee into seaDemi Lovato rushed to hospital after suspected heroin overdoseGreece wildfires: \u0026#39We ran to the beach - then the trees burst into flames\u0026#398,000 counsellors to go into schools to protect a generation crushed by digital pressures, Health Secretary reveals British jihadis should face new treason law, former Home Secretary, MI5 chief and Lord Chief Justice say\u0026#39Grab her p----\u0026#39 University student \u0026#39quoted Trump before raping girl\u0026#39, court hears\u0026#39Snapchat Queen\u0026#39 who orchestrated boyfriend\u0026#39s killing and posted video of him dying guilty of manslaughterTaxpayers could be asked to pay lump-sum \u0026#39retirement levy\u0026#39 under plans being considered by ministers Ian Paisley suspended by DUP and Parliament following  probe into Sri Lankan holidaysDuchess of Cornwall has ice cream mishap with Judi DenchMet Office top minds split on whether climate change is the main cause of the summer heatwavesDonald Trump claims Russia is interfering in US midterms to help DemocratsPakistan on unprecedented security lockdown as voters head to the polls after election campaign marred by violenceBryan Ferry pays tribute to ex-wife Lucy Birley, found dead at 58Comment: The single word that says so much about Olly Robbins – the Brexiteers’ bête noireImproving women and children\u0026#39s health has lifelong impactNovichok victim reveals girlfriend fell ill within 15 minutes of spraying \u0026#39branded\u0026#39 perfume bottleElderly people turned away from care homes with spare beds because of staff shortagesEbola outbreak declared over in Democratic Republic of CongoWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly. There is no way of disposing of this amount of clothing in a way that is not environmentally invasive.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Meanwhile, almost a third of all UK households stocked up on painkilling tablets over the past month.Sales of firelighters jumped 47 per cent and shops sold 30 per cent more burgers as customers lit up their barbecues. Sales of sun creams were boosted 38 per cent, thanks to soaring temperatures.Separate figures from Nielsen also pointed to a World Cup boost with total grocery sales volumes rising 2.2 per cent over the latest four-week period, the strongest growth since July 2013.John Lewis sold four times more electrical cooling products in the week to 15 July than in the week before as forecasters predicted no relief from the heat for at least two weeks.Mike Watkins, Nielsen’s UK head of retailer insight, said: “The past four weeks have been a strong trading period for food retailers, with volume growths the best they’ve been since July 2013.\u0026nbsp“This is great news for retailers and manufacturers as shoppers are buying more food and drink. It’s also good news that the hot summer weather looks set to continue for the next few weeks, with the hottest days of the year (35C) expected later this week.\u0026nbsp“With the summer holiday season now truly under way, retailers will be planning inspiring media campaigns supported by compelling in-store promotions, to encourage shoppers to keep spending.”Asda saw the strongest growth of the big four supermarkets, with sales up 3.7 per cent in the quarter, the first time it has been the best performer since December 2014 and eclipsing its prospective merger partner Sainsbury’s which posted sales up 0.8 per cent.\u0026nbspThe Co-op registered the fastest growth of all supermarkets at 6.4 per cent, helped by shoppers’ desire to maximise their enjoyment of the sunshine by picking up goods in smaller, local shops, Kantar said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

So she started oneClick to followThe Independent OnlineAtes is also the author of 2009 book ‘Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution’, and has required police protection ever sinceSeyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Expertly paced, Snap offers a beautiful evocation of the lives of children, and how they perceive and manage tragedy.”“At the intersection of class, race, gender and sexual violence, it deals with oppression and power with a Beckettian sense of humour, offering a wholly original take on Ireland in the time of the Troubles through the mind of a young girl.”Oblique, subtle, minimal, unmanipulative: the style of the pictures is the book’s worldview. Drnaso uses images to express an idea about what’s invisible – an idea about uncertainty, and the different kinds of holes that missing people leave in our lives.“A dazzling exploration of race in the Atlantic world, which also manages to be a yarn and a chase story. It manages to keep you on the edge of your seat, while making you, as a reader, want to savour every moment.”“An ambitious mosaic of virtuosic ventriloquism, Guy Gunaratne’s book is an inner city novel for our times, exploring the endurance of social trauma across generations, and conveying the agony and energy of the marginalised, the outsider, and the oppressed.”“A hypnotic, mythic, unexpected story from a beguiling new voice. Everything Under is an exploration of family, gender, the ways we understand each other and the hands we hold out to each other – a story that’s like the waterways at its heart.”“A novel about gender, class and the absolute corruption of the American dream, The Mars Room explores the meaning of incarceration in our moment. It feels terrifyingly authentic.”“This chilling, beautifully written novel explores the ways in which extreme parental protection can fail, and unpicks patriarchy at its core, forcing us to ask what it means to survive, indeed whether it is possible to survive, in a man’s \u0026nbspworld.”“Wonderfully atmospheric, beautifully paced, subtle storytelling. Warlight contains an incredible array of characters through whom Ondaatje tells the hidden, barely spoken, tale of war, especially as it impacts on children.”“An ecological epic, a novel of ideas, The Overstory begins with five apparently distinct narratives and then binds them into a compelling network of connections.”“A book about a man and a city in shock, it’s an extraordinary evocation of the debris and the ongoing destruction of war even in times of peace., Robin Robertson shows the flexibility a poet can bring to form and style.”“A very intimate character study of two young people trying to figure out how to love each other, Normal People is written in compressed, composed, allusive prose that invites you read behind the lines”“A deft, unshowy novel about manhood and momentous contingency, it evokes the way in which real lives unfold and wrap around each other.”The shortlist for the Man Booker Prize 2018 will be announced on 20 September, and the winner on 16 OctoberEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And when it did, the atmosphere might have been\u0026nbspfar more habitable than it is today, ready to support life, if only briefly.That is according to two senior planetary researchers who found that the Moon might have had conditions to support simple lifeforms some four billion years ago. The same conditions might have arrived during a peak of volcanic activity 3.5 billion years ago, claim the researchers.During that time, the Moon was spewing out vast amounts of very hot gases, including water vapour. Those gases might have formed into liquid water on the surface as well as creating an atmosphere that could keep it there.“If liquid water and a significant atmosphere were present on the early Moon for long periods of time, we think the lunar surface would have been at least transiently habitable,” said Dirk Schulze-Makuch,\u0026nbspan astrobiologist at Washington State University, who wrote the paper with\u0026nbspIan Crawford, a professor of planetary science and astrobiology at the University of London.The Moon is also thought to have been wrapped in a magnetic field that would have kept any lifeforms who lived there safe from deadly solar winds.The earliest evidence of life on Earth comes from about\u0026nbsp3.5 and 3.8 billion years old, in the form of cyanobacteria. During that time, the solar system was a violent place marked by frequent meteorite impacts – it is possible that some life could have been carried up to the moon in the wake of one of those blasts, the researchers suggest.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

That could examine moon deposits from the period to find if they include signs of life, or simulating the conditions of the early Moon on Earth or the International Space Station, to see whether life could exist there.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But the Met Office said today there was a 20 per cent chance that figure could be eclipsed on Friday.A slightly greater chance, of 30 per cent, existed of beating the hottest ever July day. Heathrow Airport saw thermometers hit 36.7C three years ago.“If we did break the record, it would be on Friday,” meteorologist Mark Wilson told\u0026nbspThe Independent.And long-range forecasts suggested the above-average heat may continue for another month, he said. Any respite from thunderstorms or showers would not last long.“Early signs are that the next 30 days will remain drier, sunnier and hotter than average, although there may be some more unsettled, short-lived spells,”\u0026nbspMr Wilson added, while warning that the further into the future a forecast looked, the lower the confidence in its predictions.Sweltering conditions in recent weeks\u0026nbsphave turned fields brown, ripened wild berries months earlier than normal and precipitated an amber-level heat health warning, with people urged to stay in the shade.Social workers are on high alert to check on people having difficulties in the heat, council leaders said.But the Local Government Association (LGA) also urged the public to check on vulnerable or elderly neighbours, family or friends, warning\u0026nbspthat the elderly and those suffering from heart and respiratory problems were most at risk.Social workers, community wardens and maintenance staff were all on high alert to identify those who could be struggling, it said.Council workers will be making calls and extra visits to people at risk, but the LGA also urged the public to keep an eye on people vulnerable to heat.UK weather: Temperatures soar as heatwave intensifiesPeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in BrightonPeople enjoying the hot weather and sunshine on the banks of the River Thames in

And, of course, the idea that we only get food imports into this country from one continent is not appropriate.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union “But we will look at the issue in the round and make sure there is adequate food supply.”The Brexit secretary added: “I’m not going to give more detail until I can set it out in a responsible and full fashion.”Mr Raab acknowledged the “uncertainty we would face” in the short term, if the UK left the EU without a deal, but insisted: “Long term, we would still be able to thrive.”And he refused to repeat his predecessor’s\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspboast that a full trade deal could be agreed with the EU by exit day next March, saying: “That would be a challenge, but one that I’m up for.”Caroline Lucas, the Green MP and supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, seized on the comments about stockpiling food, saying: “This will alarm my constituents and millions of other people across the country.“In just over two years since the 2016 referendum, we’ve gone from being told that\u0026nbsp \u0027there is no downside to Brexit, only a significant upside\u0027, to the government now warning that we might not have enough food to go around.”Despite Mr Raab’s comments about food imports from other continents, the government’s own figures show that 30 per cent came from the EU in 2016.Theresa May says she is taking charge of Brexit talksMay will keep UK under EU laws for another 21 monthsCorbyn went full Trump in his latest speech about BrexitCriminals could go free because of ‘catastrophic’ Brexit security dealThe next highest figure is 5 per cent – from Africa – with 49 per cent produced domestically, in the UK.During the evidence session, the Brexit secretary acknowledged the Chequers plan had involved significant concessions, while insisting it was “too crude to say ‘meets the EU halfway’.”Mr Raab also insisted there was “no tension” between him and Olly Robbins, the prime minister’s chief Brexit adviser, who is now leading the approach to the negotiations.“We have been very clear about this – there’s no tension between us, I think that’s clear – that all the advice and all of the meetings will be attended by me, with the prime minister, and that all the advice will come to me.He dismissed allegations of “serious questions about the constitutional propriety of having an unelected unit” in Downing Street making Brexit policy.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

To that end I am making some changes to the ision of functions between the Department for Exiting the European Union\u0026nbspand the Cabinet Office.“DExEU will continue to lead on all of the government’s preparations for Brexit: domestic preparations in both a deal and a no deal scenario, all of the necessary legislation, and preparations for the negotiations to implement the detail of the future framework. To support this, DExEU will recruit some new staff, and a number of Cabinet Office officials coordinating work on preparedness will move to DExEU while maintaining close ties with both departments.Ms May said that, from now on, Downing Street will\u0026nbspassume responsibility “for the preparation and conduct of the negotiations”.She said: “I will lead the negotiations with the European Union, with the secretary of state for exiting the European Union deputising on my behalf. Both of us will be supported by the Cabinet Office Europe Unit and with this in mind the Europe Unit will have overall responsibility for the preparation and conduct of the negotiations, drawing upon support from DExEU and other departments as required.Some staff will move\u0026nbspfrom the Brexit department to the Cabinet Office as part of the shakeup but\u0026nbspthe total number of Brexit department staff\u0026nbspwill not be cut, Ms May said.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union The change follows\u0026nbspmonths of frosty relations between No 10 and the Brexit department, with Mr Davis having grown increasingly frustrated at the direction Mr Robbins was taking. Tory Brexiteers are suspicious of Mr Robbins, who they see as being a supporter of a soft Brexit, and\u0026nbspare likely to raise concerns about him assuming a greater role at the expense of Mr Raab, a vocal Eurosceptic.\u0026nbspThe move\u0026nbspis also likely to be seen as a sign of mounting concern among Ms May’s team at the prospect of failing to secure\u0026nbspa deal by the October deadline.\u0026nbspAsked about the changes while giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee, Mr Robbins said Mr Raab would continue to lead talks with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, but that Ms May considered the negotiating strategy to be her “personal responsibility”.May will keep UK under EU laws for another 21 monthsNo-deal Brexit will make it ‘illegal’ to pay pensions to retired BritsCriminals could go free because of ‘catastrophic’ Brexit security dealMr Raab, appearing before the same committee,\u0026nbspadmitted there had been some “shifting of Whitehall deckchairs” but said he would continue to deputise for Ms May.

The left-leaning Pakistan People’s Party, led by the son of assassinated former leader Benazir Bhutto, should stand ready to play kingmaker in third place – but adding to the chaos, PPP has already ruled out a coalition with either main party.It has also been an exceptionally violent buildup to Wednesday’s vote. Since campaigning began, around 200 people – four of them candidates – have lost their lives in terrorist attacks.Mr Khan has painted himself as the change candidate, and used Mr Sharif’s jailing over the ownership of luxury property in London to frame PTI as the anti-corruption party.But he is also favoured by conservatives and the military, and Mr Sharif has accused the country’s immensely powerful generals of “pre-rigging” the election in PTI’s favour. He says they also had a hand in his conviction and 10-year sentence.Speaking to The Independent in Islamabad, PML-N central media coordinator Muhammad Mandi said the party was “ready for a landmark\u0026nbspelection”. “Our workers are charged, our voters are ready to get out and vote and we issue a warning to the authorities concerned, that we will not tolerate any rigging.”Here’s what we can expect of Pakistan’s likely new leader, Imran KhanBlood appeal after 128 killed and hundreds injured in Pakistan bombingBomb blast in Pakistan kills at least 128 people ahead of electionCould Trump-Kim summit inspire a wave of other unlikely peace talks?Party members have been told to be “watchdogs” of the vote, casting their own ballots before going on to watch the process of counting and the retiring officers for any irregularities.Mr Mandi said the Pakistani nation had widely accepted Mr Sharif’s narrative of “respect the vote”, which paints the military, courts and conservative establishment as anti-democratic. “No one can stop the PML-N winning the general election on Wednesday,” he said.PTI’s spokeman Asad Umar claimed the party was ahead “in all opinion polls”. “On 25 July, the people of Pakistan will defeat the corrupt mafia and Imran Khan will be the new prime minister,” he said. Mr Umar described the rigging charges from PML-N as “baseless and nonsense”. “After the arrest of Nawaz Sharif they are nervous, and they want to make the election controversial,” he said.In a pre-election assessment report, an independent think tank called the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) said there was little doubt there had been attempts at what has been dubbed “pre-rigging”.According to its own modelling, the two parameters that have depreciated the most since Pakistan’s last election were the perception of neutrality of the military towards political parties and candidates, awarded the lowest score of 33.4 per cent, followed by the perception of freedom of private media from the influence of state institutions and vested interests, receiving a score of 37.8 per cent.Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, president of Pildat, said:\u0026nbsp“It is a fact that all mainstream parties are complaining about pre-poll rigging, and the mainstream public are not happy with the way the election campaign has been run.“In the history of Pakistan we have not had many elections about which we can say they were free and fair,” he said. “Now we have to see whether the pre-election rigging will fulfil the objectives of the establishment of Pakistan, and what the fallout will be if it does not.The chief election commissioner (CEC), retired Justice Sardar Muhammad Raza, on Tuesday assured voters that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was “trying its best to hold free, fair and unbiased elections”.In a video message released by the election body, Mr Raza urged voters to fulfil their “duty towards the nation” by casting their votes calmly and responsibly on polling day.\u0026nbspPolling begins at 8am local time, and concludes at 6pm.

For the first time in history, five trans candidates will be standing for election, and there are also a record 171 women in the running, though they make a small minority of the 12,500 candidates vying for national and provincial seats across the country.Nonetheless, there will be a huge security presence trying to maintain order on the streets on Wednesday, with approximately 800,000 law enforcement and army personnel deployed.Of more than 85,000 polling stations across the country, around 17,000 have been declared “highly sensitive” and will receive special security measures.The majority of these – more than 11,000 – were in the populous Punjab and Sindh provinces, where the election is expected to be won or lost. Rights activists have also expressed concern that soldiers will be positioned inside booths where votes are cast.For Ayesha Siddiqa, a defence analyst and author of a book about the power and financial holdings of Pakistan’s military, the outlook is worrying.

(Image: )Beavers can make easy work of bringing down trees and saplings with their powerful rodent incisors, creating rich habitats by building dams and affecting the flow of water course.Birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, a host of invertebrates as well as plants can all benefit from beaver activities, while they are also effective in improving water quality and reducing flooding.Contrary to some misguided beliefs, beavers do not have a significant impact on forestry or agriculture and nor do they eat fish.The Forestry Commission first announced in March 2017 that it was hoping to trial a beaver reintroduction in the Forest of Dean\u0026rsquos Greathough Brook and was subsequently granted a licence by English Nature to release the animals at a carefully chosen and secure site.Rebecca Wilson, head of planning and environment, West England Forest District, Forestry Commission, said: \u0026ldquoBeavers are natural habitat engineers, restoring complex wetland habitats and providing habitat for declining species while slowing the flow of water downstream.\u0026ldquoWe are delighted to welcome beavers to the Forest of Dean and are keen to observe the many benefits they will bring to both local communities and the wider Forest of Dean environment.Historic records show how the Greathough Brook was once home to thriving populations of scarce wildlife such as water vole, glow-worms as well as wood white and pearl-bordered fritillary butterflies, species depend on light, warm conditions that are no longer found with the decline in sheep grazing and shading from trees.The beaver trial will be used to identify how their dam-building can hold large volumes of water.

All so that the Prime Minister can get a cheap PR hit to try to cling on to power.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT union said the Government had ignored pay review body advice to give all teachers and heads the same rise and the British Medical Association said doctors had been let down.The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated that the increases will cost departments around \u0026pound800m.

She would have let Charlotte run riot in her bedroom, trying on all her designer clothes and shoes and raiding her make-up bag.It’s so tragic that all of these happy times were not to be. When William saw all of his children come into the world, most especially baby Charlotte, he must have felt the loss of his mother even more keenly.Diana would have been there with her arms full of presents, and not just for the babies. There would have been thoughtful gifts for Kate and lots of hugs and happy tears.You can well picture her ­giving newlywed Harry a cheeky nudge and telling him to “get on with it” so she could have more grandchildren to spoil.I also think that if Diana had still been alive this sad situation between Meghan Markle and her dad would never have been allowed to turn so toxic.Diana would have seen this potential problem looming even before the engagement was announced and nipped it firmly in the bud.She would have insisted and ensured he was invited to the UK and would have dispensed shrewd and invaluable advice on how to deal with all of the hoopla surrounding the wedding. Diana learned the hard way how to deal with the media and palace officials. She was misquoted, manipulated and misunderstood during her time as a royal wife and knew all the pitfalls and how to avoid them.Skittish Meghan would have been soothed and calmed and all of the bad feeling among the Markle family would have surely evaporated.Diana would have advised Meghan’s dad on his wedding suit, helped him with his speech and rehearsed him walking down the aisle.She would have put this rather shy and ordinary man completely at ease.Rather than watching his daughter getting married on TV while cowering in a cheap bed and breakfast in the US, he would have been an integral part of the happiest day of her life.Instead, we have a constant stream of ill-advised interviews given by Thomas where he appears to have been ignored and abandoned and, whether it’s fair or not, Meghan seems increasingly cold-hearted.Photos yesterday of. him celebrating his 74th birthday alone with just a fast food takeaway for company don’t exactly help, whether they were staged again or not.A present, phone call or card from Meghan would have gone a long way to build bridges.It’s all turning a tawdry soap opera meaning commentators such as Sharon Osbourne will keep the pot boiling.Just this week she inferred Thomas has a drink problem and should get clean, ensuring more lurid headlines and bad feeling as he furiously has to deny all of the allegations.No one is coming out of this well and never has Princess Diana been more missed.Harry needs her wise counsel and William knows what an important part she could have played in the lives of his ­children.I know her sons will never really get over her death, but I do hope when William looks into his daughter’s beautiful eyes he is heartened to see a reflection of his mum rather than finding it ­unbearably sad.THE way BBC News treated Cliff Richard was utterly shameful and I’m not in the least surprised it lost its court case.The poor man went through years of hell and became a virtual recluse – and his physical and mental health was profoundly affected.At a time when he should have been enjoying the rewards of a lifetime’s graft, he was enduring sleepless nights and often crying in anguish on the kitchen floor.Many in the media have expressed fear and disquiet that any sort of Cliff’s Law will mean restrictions on newspapers, radio and TV, and this is indeed troubling.But the blame should be pointed firmly at those who thought it was a good idea to send a helicopter to film and report an OTT police raid on an innocent man.Seeing Cliff outside the courtroom this week looking extremely fragile and on the verge of tears was heartbreaking.Clearly the sunny, friendly, optimistic Peter Pan of Pop has gone for good and in his place is a haggard, careworn, wary victim.Before the court case, Cliff told me he doesn’t have photos taken with fans and their children any more.It was painful to see the hurt and mistrust in his eyes.He then revealed this week that his VIP status meant he was allowed to use the secret Wimbledon tunnel under Centre Court and Court No1 to bounce quickly between both venues and view as much tennis as possible.Cliff doesn’t do that any more, and never will, because the tunnel goes past the ball boys’ changing area and he doesn’t want to put himself in a situation where he could potentially be accused of something unspeakable.I really hope that when enough time has passed he can get some of that old “glass half full” spirit back, but he will never be the person he was.And no one else should have to go through such a hideous ordeal when they have done nothing wrong.IF you don’t want to watch a movie that will make you laugh, cry and come out singing Abba songs, we can’t be friends.I thoroughly enjoyed Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again – a rare example of a sequel that is better than the original.The starry cast includes Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, PIerce Brosnan, Andy Garcia and Colin Firth. But the cherry on the icing on the cheesecake is the legend that is Cher.I was lucky enough to host the world premiere this week in London and had the chance to talk to the cast, who were effusive in their praise of Her Cherness.It was surprising to hear she STILL gets nervous before going on set and she was genuinely bewildered by all the love in the air for her.I thought one elderly gay gentleman was going to explode with happiness when Cher blew him a kiss.It was so endearing – and there is nothing more deliciously camp than Cher stepping out of a helicopter in a blonde wig and sequins before going on to sing Super Trouper. She’s a class act and a throughly lovely woman.WATCHING politicians squabble like ferrets in a sack soon loses its novelty value – and our eyes are now glazing over whenever the dreaded subject of Brexit rears its ugly head.But we should never forget that when we woke up the day after the referendum – to discover a majority had voted to leave the EU – there was NO actual plan.Bupkis. Nada. Zilch. Diddly-squat.There wasn’t even a “to do” list.Instead, all the rats deserted the sinking ship, claiming the dog had eaten their homework or a big boy did it and ran away – leaving the (female) PM to tidy up their reeking mess. Funny that.No matter which way you voted, surely we can all agree on one thing.There was little or no thought put into how to actually implement such a seismic change. Not even a few notes on the back of a fag packet.Now, two years down the line, the whole big, fat mess is farcical and beyond parody.As a nation, we are a laughing stock.Shame on all those careerists and fence-sitters for their arrogance, stupidity and downright mendacity in not having even a half-arsed plan in place.A parcel of rogues, right enough.IF you fancy a right good laugh at some silly, bonkers, hilarious fun and games, tune in to BBC1 today at 5.05pm for another helping of Wedding Day Winners with myself and Rob Beckett.One couple will actually get married at the end of the show and it’s all very lighthearted and joyful.DID Burberry REALLY need to make a bonfire of its overpriced designer swag and burn an eye-watering £28million worth of clothing and cosmetics?In line with other designer labels, the fashion house claims the move was to stop counterfeiters getting their hands on garments and using them to produce fakes.But surely that just doesn’t add up.If criminals want to reproduce any designer clothes or handbags, they can go into any shop and purchase something – or, even simpler, just order it online.Could Burberry not instead have the mother of all sales in aid of Help for Heroes, or for the homeless charity Centrepoint, or any number of deserving causes here and in the Third World?That £28million would have gone a hell of a long way to help those in need.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politics is a man’s world and, to many, women still feel like token visitors.Even when Tony Blair famously had 101 “babes” in his 1997 intake of MPs, only four of his Cabinet appointments were female.Here we are, 20 years later, and yes, we have a female Prime Minister but there is still a prevailing view that the Cabinet, in particular, belongs to men.Clearly there’s something profoundly wrong with that equation.Given that this country is made up, more or less equally, of men and women, things would undoubtedly be fairer, not to mention calmer, if more women were on board.So the big question is, why aren’t there?Things are better than they were. Since the 2017 election there are 208 women in the Commons, up from 191 in 2015.But there are still not enough and you don’t have to look far for reasons why that might be.Most women are put off by the environment and the culture and wonder why on earth they would want to put themselves within a country mile of either.Take Prime Minister’s Question Time, which appears to be a bunch of overgrown public school boys booing, jeering and jostling with each other in their bid to establish who is top dog.What woman in her right mind would choose to enter that fray?Then there are the practicalities. This week, Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson was “cheated” in a crunch Brexit vote by the breaking of her pairing pact.This is an arrangement where one MP agrees not to vote to cancel out the fact that another MP on the opposite side is unable to vote — in this case Swinson was at home with her three-week-old baby.The problem was, her pairing partner reneged on the deal and voted.Then there are the hours, which can be difficult if you have a family. Any woman would need a very understanding partner and family to do the job.Also, any MP is opening themselves up to the line of fire and a lot of personal criticism — which multiplies for female MPs.Some have to deal with endless comments and speculation about their appearance, as well as threats of rape and death on a regular basis. Just this week a man was arrested over abusive Facebook posts aimed at various female MPs.If it’s true voters are biased against women, any female has to be ten times as talented, determined and tenacious to get the job in the first place.It’s no wonder women are put off entering politics.But if we want true equality then more women need to go into Westminster and the culture needs to change.That is why I support the campaign group Women To Win and will be taking part in an event called The Voice Of Women In Politics.The idea is to try to encourage more women into Parliament, outlining some of the changes that need to take place to raise the number of female candidates.Getting more women into politics is a no brainer.Women tend to work collaboratively to solve problems whereas — in my experience — men are more likely to lock horns, point fingers and try to shout the loudest. All too often men are interested in progressing to be a leader, whereas women are more focused on getting the job done.And when women DO find their voice in politics, it can be very powerful, and they often hae the balls to say things that men just wouldn’t.Look at Tory minister Anna Soubry, who this week suggested the PM should take control of her hardliner MPs and stop pandering to the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg.I know she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment, but if I was Theresa May I would be spending a good proportion of my time and energy on making real changes to politics in order, specifically, to attract many more women.It could be one of the greatest legacies she could hope for.Thomas Markle is a concerned dad who just wants to be reconnected with his daughter.Meanwhile this HALF-sister has turned a constant shade of green and wants to get involved in any way she can.Is it any wonder she wasn’t invited to the wedding?MY heroine of the week is 21-year-old Emilia Holden a waitress in Georgia, US, who was at the end of a shift when a customer casually grabbed her bottom as he walked past.Her response? She followed him, grabbed him and body slammed him to the ground, then called the police – after which he spent two nights in a police cell.What a fantastic response. Good for her.But also, who are these men that think that they can just grab a woman’s behind just because they want to?But hearing about elaborate plans by Pixie Lott which include a total of 18 bridesmaids all wearing the same dress, left me feeling a bit stressed out.Apart from anything else, it will take them all an hour to travel up the aisle.JAMES GODDARD-WATTS, the businessman whose family founded the hardware firm Screwfix, is still locked in a multi-million pound divorce battle with his ex-wife, Julia.They reached an agreement eight years ago ­– following the end of a 13-year marriage – that Mrs Goddard-Watts should get a £3.25million house and a £4million lump sum.But she complained that Mr Goddard-Watts had not revealed the full extent of his wealth at the time of the settlement and court fights began.Critics say Julia is a leech, greedy and after his money.But when you consider the worth and value of building a home, looking after children and a family while supporting a spouse, that should be worth at least half of whatever the partner who didn’t do all of that has earned in the meantime.So why shouldn’t she take him back to court?The law states that assets are divided equally.So people who hide theirs from their spouse only have themselves to blame if said spouse feels forced to take them to court to get what’s fair.ELLE Macpherson’s diet regime is enough to make me reach for the pizza delivery menu.The model is up at 5am. She has warm water, lemon and cayenne pepper.She has no booze, almost no carbs, no meat and no dairy. She is such a follower of the alkaline diet – based on the theory you can change the pH of your body through food – that she checks the acidity of her urine.I’m sure the diet is good for her – but who wants to add years to your life if those years are going to be so, well, dull?“The only chance I have of being on TV again is if I were very ugly,” he said.“I think only old, ugly women can get on TV. Like Mary Beard.”David added that he would only be hired now: “If I had tombstone teeth and rather funny hair and made a lot of noise about that fact.”Oh dear.Where even to start? When you resort to attacking someone’s appearance, you are in trouble.It’s not Mary Beard that has held back his career. It’s David himself.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or a crap remake of Fight Club — except they DO talk about Fight Club. All the time.Theresa May has the leadership skills of a damp dishcloth, no authority and no political vision.A strong leader needs a clear mission. You may not agree with it, but you know what they stand for.“Live each day like it’s your last,” is our Prime Minister’s political strategy, except she’s not dancing in the rain.She is waiting for the sharks to circle. And soon they will come for her.Buffoon-in-chief Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg — a man so old-fashioned he could have been dug up by Time Team — wait to pounce. And Brexit is a mess. Things are so bad, even Elon Musk is out of ideas. No one will be happy with where we end up.And because there is no party political or Brexit majority in the Commons, politics is stuck, trapped in what feels like a never-ending Brexistential crisis.Normally, I’m with “Brenda From Bristol” when it comes to more elections and referendums.But maybe a People’s Vote on the final deal or another election is the only way to unblock Brexit.Think of it like a political plunger — unpleasant, nasty but necessary.You’d think the Opposition would be gleefully capitalising on all this chaos. Think again. Instead of going after the Tories, Labour has decided to traumatise the Jewish community. Again.Labour has had a horrible problem with anti-Semitism, yet instead of healing the wound, it has poured vinegar on it by choosing not to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance code of conduct.These guys sound pretty authoritative and the code is good enough for government departments and the Crown Prosecution Service.Many Jewish groups and leaders, including the Chief Rabbi, are distraught, confused and angry. And you can see why.This shameful decision led to an angry clash outside the Commons chamber where Jewish MP Margaret Hodge confronted Jeremy Corbyn, allegedly calling him an anti-Semite and a racist.Hodge lost family in the Holocaust and fought off the BNP in her Barking and Dagenham constituency.Instead of acknowledging her pain and offering to sit down with her, Team Corbyn are taking disciplinary action against her.I bet they deal with her far quicker than they did with Ken Livingstone, who couldn’t stop banging on about Hitler.What dark times for Labour, which once had a proud tradition of fighting racism. They must sort it out.Then we have the Lib Dems, who have proved useless. They have one policy — stop Brexit.Yet leader Vince Cable and ex-leader Tim Farron missed crucial votes on Monday. Talk about Dem and Dumber.To top it all off, the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jnr has been suspended for 30 days — which hasn’t happened since 1949 — for failing to declare lavish holidays to that well-known Northern Irish stakeholder, Sri Lanka.And to think Theresa May planned to give MPs an extra five days off as a reward for all their hard work.The country has had enough of these fools’ infighting, incompetence and filling their boots. Especially when we face so many big problems, from NHS funding to housing.Parliament’s end-of-term report is a big, fat fail. British politics should be taken into special measures.THE premiere of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was sun-kissed, frothy fun –  and no one mentioned the ­Customs Union. Bliss.The stars were out in full, including Cher. She is magnificent, but it is a little odd that at 72 she has fewer wrinkles than any other cast member, including 29-year-old Lily James. And the baby.She told Lorraine Kelly it was down to not drinking, smoking or doing drugs. Yeah, right.We women may be naive when it comes to the quest for eternal beauty, but we ain’t stupid.WHEN you hear of people getting up in the middle of the night and queuing, you think of the Boxing Day sales or the release of the latest Apple gadget.You don’t think of childcare.Yet more than 100 parents queued from 3am – armed with chairs, flasks and biscuits – trying to bag their child a coveted place in the breakfast club at a primary school in Cardiff.For many working parents, breakfast clubs are a lifeline.They can drop off the children in a safe environment where they can get a decent breakfast, then make it to work on time themselves.Though parents have the right to request flexible working hours, many fear the sack if they come in late.These spaces were limited and dished out on a first-come, first-served basis, which is why the parents took such drastic measures.This shows how desperate parents are for childcare that matches their working hours.The scrapping of Labour’s extended school programme and the first real-terms cuts to schools mean all these extras that were provided are no longer affordable.Childcare isn’t a luxury.It’s a necessity for millions of families and they are crying out for more breakfast and after-school clubs.JEFF BEZOS, the boss of Amazon, is a man clearly in his “Prime”.He’s now the richest man in modern history.Good for him.I’m all for celebrating entrepreneurs and hard work – but shouldn’t that apply to his poor workers toiling away in his warehouses?They would probably give Amazon working conditions zero stars.I wish our business leaders remembered some of their forefathers, who felt a moral and civic responsibility to look after their employees and took some pride in that.It makes business sense too. Happy workers are better workers.So after Bezos pops open the champagne, maybe he could spare a thought for his staff, who told an undercover reporter they pee in bottles because the loos are too far away and they are afraid of being accused of time-wasting.C’mon, Jeff – that’s really taking the p**s. ONE school in Liverpool had to apologise after kids as young as four were left in tears when they were denied an ice cream treat because they didn’t have a 97 per cent attendance record.How mean is that? What if they were ill? And surely it’s the parents’ fault.CARERS got another kick in the teeth this week when the Court of Appeal overturned a decision that those doing sleep-in shifts should earn at least the minimum wage.If the decision had gone through, it would have cost the UK care sector billions – so charities and local governments were relieved.But it shows what a raw deal carers get.Judges said only hours spent awake counted as work – but that is completely out of touch with the reality of what carers do.Many of the elderly and vulnerable people they look after need their help through the night, whether it’s a trip to the loo, to take medication or dealing with more serious situations such as seizures. Carers can’t exactly fall into a deep sleep. They have to be alert and listening in case they are needed.The rooms they sleep in may not be comfortable and they will be away from their own families.Many carers are paid so little that they live hand to mouth and barely get by.When I met a group in the West Midlands, they told me they couldn’t afford to put the heating on in winter and had to take their kids to the grandparents’ for tea once or twice a week just so they would be fed.Some were struggling so much they had to visit food banks.But they also loved their jobs and took great pride in looking after their clients as if they were family.They get paid a pittance, with some earning just £30 for a ten-hour shift.These low-paid workers – the majority of whom are women – are unsung heroes and deserve more.New Health Secretary Matt Hancock must make social care a priority and enforce minimum-wage law properly.It’s time we took better care of our carers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The spread of social media and other online communication, with its inherent anonymity, has only increased the misery for victims.But the speed of change has not been matched by a more robust framework to deal with it.Yes, we have tougher sentences — the Government was absolutely right to last year double jail terms for the worst cases from five to ten years.But progress has been too slow in recognising these crimes.In 2016-17, fewer than 1,000 prosecutions were commenced under stalking legislation.It was horrifying to read the account of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud yesterday.She told how she faced a barrage of more than 3,000 texts over five years from an ex-boyfriend, including threats to stab and burn her.Soon after being handed a lifetime restraining order, her ex began following her on Instagram.He “wanted me to know he was still watching me”, she said, chillingly.And yet the CPS saw no realistic chance of a successful prosecution for stalking because the social media activity was not taken sufficiently seriously, despite the obvious impact on Nicola’s life.As she put it: “I should be able to move on from an unhealthy relationship if I want and that’s not been able to happen.”She wants change — and she is right to.These kinds of messages leave you in fear for your life — feeling that someone is watching or following you is immensely distressing.A bunch of flowers is not a romantic gesture when sent by a stalker but a reminder that your persecutor is still watching and can still reach you.Stalking is a crime of obsession and fixation and it needs to be stopped before it becomes deeply ingrained.No legislation will be effective unless it is accompanied by training at the front line of policing and across the wider courts system.Victims must have the confidence to come forward at an earlier stage, for all forms of stalking to be recognised for what they are. It is my intention to make this happen.My Stalking Protection Bill will introduce so-called Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) to help fill some of the gaps in the law.It will allow the police to act more quickly and to protect victims of so-called stranger stalking, where the stalker is not a former partner.Importantly, it will also take the onus off the victim to have to take action, as is currently the case for stranger stalking. At present many victims are left unprotected because they have to put protective measures in place for themselves, such as applying for a civil injunction to restrain someone from harassing them.Needless to say, many victims find this such a daunting task — not to mention expensive and time-consuming — that they end up not going through with it.If passed, the Stalking Protection Bill would allow the police to apply for an SPO through the magistrates’ courts on behalf of victims.Orders will require the civil standard of proof “on the balance of probabilities” but breach of an order would be a criminal offence, punishable in the most serious cases by a term of up to five years in prison.SPOs could set out requirements prohibiting certain behaviours, such as contacting the victim either directly or indirectly.It would be able to prohibit behaviours such as driving past the victim’s house, harassing friends, colleagues or family members, going within a certain distance of the victim or following them online.It could also set out so called positive requirements, such as attending a psychiatric assessment.In this digital age, the law would cover online contact from abroad and require that any IT equipment would be free from encryption, so perpetrators could not cover their tracks.Unlike the now-abandoned Police Information Notices, SPOs will have teeth, as they would be enforceable and breaching the terms of an order would have consequences.SPOs would also require stalkers to register all the names they use, as well as their address.While SPOs will provide better early intervention to protect victims, they are not intended to replace full prosecution for an offence of stalking.They will, however, enable police to better protect the safety of victims while gathering the full evidence for the CPS to prosecute a full stalking case.The Bill has almost completed its Commons journey but will not now return to the Chamber until late November.When the case for change is so pressing, and the Bill is backed by members across the House, I believe the Government should bring forward the final Commons stage so we can get on with delivering this vital change to the law — which will help to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For everybody who gets burgled it is just miserable.But he warned the criminals Typically weve got a good idea who our burglars are because theyre often repeat offenders and they fit a certain demographic and lifestyle.They often specialise, in a criminal sense, in burglary. They often have a particular MO.In my experience we tend to catch burglars in the end.

Around ten days ago we came across a rather large deposit at the rear of the shop.“I put it down to a bad experience and thought someone had let their dog do it. I thought it must have been a large dog that wasn’t feeling very well.“On Tuesday morning, I had an appointment to attend and as I left the shop I was met by yet another large deposit.“Because we were unsure of why this kept happening and who was allowing it, we decided to check the CCTV footage to see what was going on.“You can imagine our shock and dismay to discover what we have now seen.”Jim claims he hasn’t released the footage to “harm or shame” the woman, but to warn her not to return.He added: “I have never seen the woman before and she isn’t a customer of ours.“She was around mid-twenties, a jogger and wearing a rucksack.“I was more than prepared to give her the benefit of the doubt. I suspect she was caught short.“Once is unfortunate, twice is a coincidence but I really don’t want a third time.“I wanted to release the footage purely as a deterrent. If this was to happen again, I will be forced to hand the footage over to the authorities.“We don’t wish them any harm or shame but we do wish that they cease using our rear lane as a point of relief as it is particularly distasteful having to clean up the remains.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000422568545.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"elton john hugs prince harry at aids conference evoking memories of stars charity work with royals mum diana","story":"The Duke of Sussex is following in the footsteps of his mother in the fight against AIDS in recent years, raising awareness about HIV/AIDS and encouraging people to get tested.Harrys charity, Sentebale, focuses on supporting HIV-positive young people in the African nations of Lesotho and Botswana.The Prince introduced Sir Elton, who performed at his wedding reception, as he launched the billion-dollar MenStar Coalition at an international Aids conference in Amsterdam.The 33-year-old praised the star for campaigning to eradicate the disease.Sir Elton said more work is needed to being young men into the fold as a solution to end the scourge of the HIV virus, which is growing among certain groups.Sir Elton told the delegates: If we want to end Aids once and for all, we must make men part of the solution.It is time there was a global coalition to teach men to protect themselves, and in doing so it will teach them to better protect not only their wives and girlfriends, their sisters and daughters, but also critically their brothers and sons.The project will begin in Africa next year, where men across the continent will be encouraged to self-test for HIV, in a bid to empower them to seek treatment if positive and help stop the spread of the virus.Sir Elton said recent research had shown that men aged 24-35 were tested and treated for the HIV virus at unacceptably low rates.He added: We must find ways to change this. Too often, and for good reason, men have been seen as the problem in the fight against Aids.So in response we have done so much to safeguard women and girls, and rightly so, but we cant solve the whole problem if were only addressing half the situation.If we want to end Aids once and for all, we must make men part of the solution.Today Harry praised the work that had already been done to tackle the virus and support those who are HIV positive, but warned there is still more to do.He told the session on Monday morning: For over a quarter (of a) century, Elton has worked tirelessly to fund research and services in communities around the world.And today he has come to Amsterdam to announce his latest endeavour - a billion dollar global partnership to break the cycle of male transmission of HIV, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.We stand here at a moment when the progress we have fought so hard for is at risk from a dangerous complacency.Too many around the world are still ignoring the damaging knock-on effect on education and other community services from not prioritising HIV prevention and treatment.This is a time when new, energetic and innovative solutions are needed more than ever before – and that is exactly what you are about to see from Elton and the Men Star Coalition partners.Yesterday the duke joined a session at the conference where youth delegates from countries including India, Zimbabwe and the US spoke about how Aids has affected their lives.At the end they all gathered for a group picture and Harry even posed for a selfie with one of them.Sir Elton John and Princess Diana first met in the 1980s and became close friends. In the years leading up to her death, they worked closely with each other to help destigmatise Aids by spreading awareness about the disease.In 1987, the Peoples Princess touched the unnamed man without wearing gloves, challenging the previously believed notion the disease could be passed via skin-to-skin contact.

Labour have argued any pay increase that is not above the rate of inflation amounts to a real-terms pay cut - not exactly something that screams \"good news\".So no surprise that pay bumps for the armed forces (2.9%) and prison officers (2.75%) are being described by the Treasury as being \"well-above inflation\".But pick apart those figures and the claim seems a little misleading.But Labour\u0027s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Peter Dowd, dismissed the announcement as \"a mendacious PR exercise\".Another point of contention is how these pay increases will be paid for.In March, it was announced that some NHS workers, such as nurses, were to receive a 6.5% average pay increase over the next three years.But, that came with a pledge of extra money from the Treasury. Tuesday\u0027s announcements do not - they will come from existing departmental budgets.The government insists most departments will be able to meet the extra costs by diverting funds from budget underspends elsewhere, and in doing so will ensure the rewards are \"sustainable without an increasing burden of debt being passed onto future generations\".As she spoke in the Commons, Ms Truss was met with jeers from the opposition benches.Labour MPs stood up to raise concerns that lack of additional funding would lead to cuts to public services and redundancies down the line."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-city-london-skyline_4345806.jpg?20180626002105 ","title":"london foreign exchange sees record turnover","story":"That has caused traders to dump sterling on various occasions.And even the European Central Bank has begun to hint at interest rate rises - although most people expect it first to begin unwinding the \u0026#83642.4tn (\u0026#1632.1tn) worth of asset purchases it made from 2015 onwards to stimulate the Eurozone economy.So volatility and, accordingly, FX volumes are picking up.Other factors include growing concerns over a global trade war - the Chinese yuan is currently trading at its lowest level against the dollar for more than a year and dollar-yuan trading in London has almost doubled during the past year - more political turmoil in the Eurozone, notably in Italy, as well as volatility in emerging market currencies.It will have come as a welcome relief to all of the big global investment banks which, as volatility declined, saw the profitability of their operations in FICC (Fixed Income [bonds], Currencies \u0026 Commodities) eroded.These are now picking up again.Analysis by Reuters of the latest results from Wall Street\u0027s big five - Morgan Stanley, Citi, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America - reveals that during the first six months of the year, revenues from market trading across FICC and equities were up 10% on the same period last year.The bad news for them is that much of the take-off in volumes was during the first three months of the year, when volatility was more pronounced, with FX markets less hectic since then.The Bank\u0027s data also provides some interesting insights into what is being traded. Fibre accounted for 28.5% of daily FX volumes in April, down from 29.4% in October, while Cable\u0027s share of trading volumes rose from 12.5% to 12.9% - reflecting the swings in the pound.Perhaps reflecting events in the Korean peninsula, there was also a rise in trading in the dollar and the South Korean won, while US dollar-Canadian dollar business also picked up.Some people will decry the rise in volumes and deride it as nothing more than speculation.Well, yes, some of it undoubtedly is speculation."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-imran-khan-election-rally_4370519.jpg?20180724195716 ","title":"pakistan election ex cricket star imran khan could be prime minister","story":"His main opponent, the three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, was arrested on corruption charges when he landed in Lahore from London earlier this month.He is now campaigning from prison in Islamabad and is reported to be suffering from health issues.In his place as candidate for the centre-right Pakistan Muslim League is his brother Shahbaz Sharif.

The Type 31e light frigate was trumpeted by ministers as a cheap replacement for an ageing fleet of anti-submarine vessels. Thirteen, Type 23, Duke-class frigates are being retired and replaced by just eight Type 26 Global Combat Ships. Ministers hoped to make up the shortfall in the Senior Service with five, \u0026pound250million smaller ships which they branded the Type 31e. The “e” highlighted their hope to export it to allies. But experts warned the budget for designing and building a brand new warship was too low - and just one firm was able to make a viable bid.  Now, the Ministry of Defence has been forced to relaunch the competition to create a ship. But the \u0026pound250million budget will stay the same. A spokeswoman insisted: “There have been no changes in our plans to procure a first batch of five new Type 31e frigates to grow our Royal Navy. “We still want the first ship delivered by 2023 and are confident that industry will meet the challenge of providing them for the price tag we’ve set. “This is an early contract in a wider procurement process, and we will incorporate the lessons learned and begin again as soon as possible so the programme can continue at pace.” While officials refused to reveal details of the bids received, citing commercial sensitivity, it is understood just one came in at the \u0026pound250million limit. Sources said the single bid made an “effective and robust competition” impossible.

The Labour leader hit out at plans for an average 2% pay rise for nurses, teachers and other workers without proper funding saying that this would likely lead to further cuts in the already struggling NHS and education sector. Speaking in Birmingham Mr Corbyn promised that a Labour Government would back wage rises of 5% as suggested by unions. He said: On the public sector pay cap, the government has said it\u0027s going to lift the pay cap the reality is that they\u0027re lifting the pay cap it\u0027s going to be an increase that\u0027s below the rate of inflation and it\u0027s going to be about 0.8% below it and the unions have said 5% is what is needed for it and we support that. But we also from what we understand there\u0027s no increase in funding for that so by increasing pay by 0.8% less than inflation that can only be paid for by cuts to public services.  Public sector workers saw their pay frozen from 2010 and then capped at 1% - far below inflation. It comes as the NHS reports a crisis in nursing recruitment and schools are struggling to hire and retain teachers. Speaking at EEF Technology\u0027s apprenticeship college in Aston, Mr Corbyn said: I think public sector workers have been very badly treated since austerity came in in 2010. He promised to fund a pay rise through overall tax changes and an increase in corporation tax. Most of public sector workers will see their salaries rise under the rate of inflation, measured at 2.4% under the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Steph said the experience was some of the worst customer service she had ever witnessed. She explained: We went for chips on the boat, and when my youngest went to eat them they were too hot and he cried. There were a lot of foreign exchange students queuing up for ice creams at the time. The owner asked to \u0027take that screaming baby outside, this is not working for me.\u0027 He made us go outside with our cups, the pram and food. I had to manoeuvre through the students and had to sit on the side of a table outside. I felt like I had been pushed out. She added: He was just generally rude. He pointed outside and told us to go out very unpolitely, my baby wasn\u0027t being bad until then - it was just that he wanted the food. I have never had an experience in a business like this before. They are meant to be family friendly, there\u0027s a sign which says so, and its next to one of the biggest parks in North Devon.  Captain Hunter, who has run the cafe for around four and a half years ago, says he has \u0027put his life and soul into it.\u0027 Now he says he has \u0027had enough\u0027 with poor parenting on his family-friendly floating caf\u0026eacute and even has a sign which reads: No barking dogs, no screaming kids and no loud mobile phones.\u0027 He explained: We had a mum come in and the baby was already crying while strapped into the pram. He was very close to the counter and the screaming got louder. It continued screaming and two people stood and asked my wife at the counter to do something about it. But we said it is up to the mother to do something. Then a queue began to form at the counter right next to the pram. The baby went ballistic at all these tall people towering over him. The mum did absolutely nothing, she was more focused on her mobile phone - she should have unstrapped him and carried him around. The screaming was so loud we could not hear what people wanted at the counter - the kid just go worse as he was overheated and distressed.

But unfortunately there are two big things which get in the way - money and work. While we can\u0027t fix the money part, there\u0027s a company in Manchester which is helping its staff out with the work bit.  Recruitment start-up GradTouch has taken flexible working to a whole new level and is now offering staff unlimited annual leave, reports the Manchester Evening News .  And bosses have found it\u0027s having a really positive impact on their business, which is now growing faster than every.  Last year the average amount of holiday taken by their 22-strong team staff totted up to 46 days. Co-founder Zac Williams explains: We\u0027re huge believers in having a great company culture and we\u0027re pioneering a new way to work. We don\u0027t have set hours in our contracts, instead employees agree to focus only on results. We have an unlimited holiday policy and we encourage our staff to work from wherever they want, whenever they want. This includes the freedom to work from home or trendy coffee shops and only pop into the Northern Quarter HQ when they are required at meetings. The 29-year-old continues: It\u0027s not something that works for everyone. You have to be comfortable with autonomy and you have to be self-motivated to work in that system.  We got rid of contracted hours so all it says is that staff will do what needs to be done to get the job done - but in more legal language. In order for us to build this business we needed to hire people that are better than us and let them get on with their jobs. If you hire properly then you can build a culture based on empowerment and trust. Zac and co-founder Joe Twigg introduced the policy two years ago after a gruelling investment round which brought in \u0026pound500,000. Zac said: Williams said: We were building the platform as quick as we could and a lot of people were doing really long hours.

The bones belonged to a plant-eating animal similar to the Brachiosaurus, star of the film Jurassic Park, scientists confirmed today. It comes from the sauropod family of dinosaurs, which had long necks and tails and were the largest animals to roam the earth. “Bigfoot”, found near Mount Rushmore, confirms brachiosaurs lived over a huge swathe of North America, from eastern Utah to northwestern Wyoming, 150 million years ago. Study co-author Dr Emanuel Tschopp, of the American Museum of Natural History, said: “This is surprising. Many other sauropod dinosaurs seem to have inhabited smaller areas during that time.  “There are tracks and incomplete skeletons from Australia and Argentina that seem to be from even bigger animals, but found without feet. “This beast was clearly one of the biggest that ever walked in North America.” The foot was excavated in 1998 but has been the subject of study for 20 years. The findings were published yesterday in PeerJ journal. Researchers from the US, Switzerland and Germany used 3D scanning to help compare the specimen to feet from different dinosaur species.

Images taken from CCTV cameras at the sweet shop have been blown up to A4 size and stuck in the window.  The word \u0027THIEF\u0027 is printed above each image in large capital letters and the posters are clearly visible to passers-by. John Keppie, manager at Sweet Thoughts in Bournemouth, Dorset, said he decided to take action after police failed to investigate the shoplifting, despite being offered CCTV images. Several members of the public have also given the names of the alleged offenders to staff.  But Mr Keppie said that since the three posters appeared he has received a telephone call from the police telling him he isn\u0027t allowed to have them up. He could be in breach of the Data Protection Act (2018) and liable to a fine. His actions come after other shop owners across the country claim police have given up investigating shoplifting incidents due to a lack of manpower. In some cases there has been compelling CCTV evidence. Mr Keppie said: It was me who put the pictures in the window because I\u0027ve had enough of it now. I\u0027ve spoken to the police and I know I\u0027m not meant to have them up but until someone actually comes down and makes me take them down then they will be staying up. The thee girls came in and stole three drinks from the fridge. I gave chase and they actually turned round and spat at me. I told the police but they said they have more important things that they have to deal with.  One officer came down here and spent literally seven seconds in the shop. Their response did not leave me best pleased. I know I\u0027m not meant to have the pictures up but if they\u0027re big enough to steal and spit in my face then they\u0027re big enough to deal with it. One of the things I\u0027ve done now is send the pictures to every school in Bournemouth and Poole asking if the girls attended there. I didn\u0027t need a name, just a yes or no. One got back to me and I passed that onto the police but as yet I\u0027m still waiting to hear if anything has happened. Shoplifting is a fairly common occurrence and you can spot the ones who do it from the minute they walk in the shop. Kevin Strudwick, the crime manager for Bournemouth Business Reducing Crime Partnership, a co-operative of local business, police and council, said the \u0027wanted\u0027 posters risked turning the resort into the \u0027Wild West\u0027. Mr Strudwick said: Unfortunately with Data Protection laws you have to be very careful with what you do. Putting \u0027wanted\u0027 posters on the wall is returning to the old days of the Wild West. The CPS would not look upon it as the right thing to do and the police would also take a dim view. I sympathise with any shop which has sustained losses as they are devastating but you have to follow the laws, simple as that. It would be a different story if the shoplifter was convicted and you showed the poster to staff at the back of the store but never on public display. You also could have the situation where someone\u0027s parents or grandparents could see the poster who had no idea about what had happened, which would a great shock for them.

Storms could bring torrential downpours with large amounts of rain falling in a short time - But these will be hit-and-miss with many areas missing out completely.

The Met Office confirmed that very warm, hot or very hot conditions will continue for another five weeks throughout the UK. This means that we could be bracing ourselves for the hottest summer since the record-breaking heatwave of 1976 - which was only topped by weather conditions in the early 1600s. Detailed weather maps and charts highlight the long-range forecast, with the sweltering heat and lack of rain making this the driest spell in recent memory.  Reaching the half-way point of the meteorological summer, the daily maximum temperature is 20.9C. Meanwhile the warmest complete summer recorded saw an average daily maximum of 21C. Between June and August in 1976, the Central England Temperature (CET) on average was 17.8C, while the average maximum temperature was 20.96C. However both figures could be beaten if the hot weather continues, which forecasters say “could well be record breaking” if above average temperatures continue.  Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill explained that the warm weather is due to high pressure across the UK. Weather maps show this could hit 1024mb within days as warm air come across from Europe. He said: “Towards the east and southeast it is going to be mostly fine, hot and sunny through next week with highs of 31C (87.8F) or 32C (89.6F) from Monday. “We expect similar values on Tuesday but as we go through the week it is going to turn even hotter.

Now we move on to the next game.”And that need to be ready for next month’s league kick-off against Dunfermline means, for Murdoch and his team-mates, the next two outings are massive.“It will be difficult to qualify from our group now but we will take every game the same way we’ve always done and that’s as big ones.“We probably need to win both games now to have any chance and that’s what we’ll aim to do.“And they are another two big games leading into the start of the season in the Championship. We can get match sharpness and we will have another few boys who’ve had wee injuries back available.“It’s also another opportunity as well for the gaffer to maybe tinker with the team a bit and get boys some game time.”And, despite what the Betfred group table suggests, his belief this rebuilt United side is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the second tier, is growing.“I think everyone is confident we are building a good team and the manager will be wanting a few more players – I’m sure he’d said that.“I think the more good players we add the better we’ll play and the more we play together the better we’ll become.“It gave us confidence going to a place like County and competing the way we did. It was a good performance, it was just the result that was poor.“We are all excited about the season ahead and I think it’s going to be a positive one.”In the absence of newly-appointed club captain Fraser Fyvie, who’s likely to be out for another month or so as he completes his recovery from knee surgery at the turn of the year, the games so far have seen Murdoch wear the captain’s armband.Well aware of United’s history and some of the greats who’ve undertaken the role, he regards even having it on a temporary basis as a big feather in his cap.“I was captain a couple of times towards the end of last season and to be handed it again while Fraser is still out is nice,” he added.“This is a massive club, so to lead Dundee United out in any game is a huge honour for me.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba laszlo urging dundee united to speed up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo wants Dundee United to speed up when their Betfred Cup campaign continues at home to Alloa today.Despite a draw and a penalty shoot-out loss against Arbroath and a narrow defeat at Ross County in the two group ties so far, Csaba has been pleased with the signs coming from his rebuilt Tangerines.The next step forward he wants to see, though, is quicker use of the ball leading to more chances being created.“If I watch the team, Matej Rakovan, Adam Barton, Christoph Rabitsch, Callum Booth and others, they are really good football players,” he said.“They keep the ball well and have some good ideas, but we have to do more in the offence.“You can’t just control the game, you also have to go and finish, bring more danger in front of the opponent’s goal, be quicker.“I told them that for the second half at Ross County, ‘OK we are comfortable with the ball but we have to bring more danger’.”Fraser Aird will be in the squad after he sat out the County trip.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"disappointed dundee united boss csaba focuses on dunfermline in league opener","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United boss Csaba Laszlo was disappointed by his team’s latest Betfred Cup disappointment at the weekend.But he’s reminded fans that it’s all about being ready to win matches when the Championship season kicks off against Dunfermline next week.For the third group stage tie in a row, Saturday saw the Tangerines fail to record a victory as they were held to a draw by Alloa over 90 minutes and then lost the bonus point penalty shootout.It means they have no chance of progressing to the knockout stages and Csaba admitted he was angered by aspects of the performance, particularly during a second half that saw United let the lead slip late on.He isn’t, though, losing sight of the bigger picture.“Again, like the last game, until 80 minutes we are even in front in the game and then make a stupid mistake,” he said.“In the first half I think generally the team played some good football but the second half, according to me, this was not what I want to see. Definitely not.“I think this was to do with the changes we had to make and because we didn’t keep the ball in the front and be more simple.“Nicky Clark was tired and James Keatings has just come back from an injury so he got tired. After that our attacking game was not there.“But I want a team who is ready for Dunfermline, that is ready for the league. We have the two weeks and we go now for the next level.”And Csaba was quick to point out United have not been the only team to have problems in these early season fixtures.“I have watched the results and every big team is struggling. You are not there where you want to be at the moment. This is not an excuse but it is true. If you train every week two times daily you see that legs are tired. Still, with these tired legs you have to win the game one zero, or two zero and finish.”United now head for Elgin City on Saturday knowing they have no chance of qualifying.It will, however, be another vital game as the manager tries to knock his new-look side into shape in their last outing before the league business starts.United’s ‘Meet the fans day’ takes place at Tannadice on Sunday when supporters will get the chance to see the team train.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/DN7D1449.JPG-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fans and tottenham teammates turn out to pay respects to football legend alan gilzean","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFans and former teammates paid tribute to Dundee icon Alan Gilzean on Friday as the legendary striker made his final journey past Dens Park.Supporters young and old braved the rain as the hearse carrying the title-winning forward drove up Sandeman Street just before midday.The ex-Dark Blues and Tottenham Hotspur star died earlier this month aged 79, just weeks after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.Among those to attend his funeral at Dundee Crematorium were several of his ex-Spurs teammates, including Pat Jennings and Alan Mullery.About 80 supporters gathered outside the stadium to pay their respects.Mark Kerr, 64, originally from Lochee, travelled down from Inverness to bid farewell to Mr Gilzean, who he said was one of his heroes.He said: “I was at Dens when Dundee won the league.“I was seven years old and I remember it distinctly.“I watched him playing in Europe and it confirmed I wanted to be a Dundee supporter for life.“I saw Alan at a hall of fame dinner at the Invercarse recently, so I was shocked to hear of his passing.“I’m the chairman of the Highland Dark Blues. I’ve come down from Inverness to pay my respect, and I’ll be raising a drink in his memory tonight.”Born in Coupar Angus, Gilzean is considered one of the finest players to grace Dens Park and netted an unrivalled 169 goals during the halcyon days of the 1950s and 60s.His eye for a goal was a crucial factor in Dundee’s title-winning season in 1961-62, before the club went on to reach the semi-final of the European Cup.Season ticket holder George McLaren, 73, said: “He has been such a big part of Dundee FC. My favourite memories of him are probably the goals against Dundee United.“I was shocked to hear of his passing and wanted to come here today to pay my respects. He will never be forgotten. He proved himself here at Dens and at Spurs.“An absolute legend for both clubs.”Fellow fan Daniel Smith, 33, from Maryfield, added: “There’s been a good turnout of people paying their respects here today at Dens.“He is a Dundee legend. I grew up on stories about Gilzean through the years and the things he accomplished at Dens. He still holds a number of records at Dens Park.”A tribute on the Dundee FC website stated: “Everyone at Dundee Football Club was devastated to learn of the death of Dundee legend Alan Gilzean aged 79 after a short illness.“A true Dundee legend in every sense of the word, we may never see his goal scoring like again and the thoughts of everyone at Dens Park are with Alan’s family and friends at this difficult and sad time.”He made the jump from Tayside to Tottenham in 1964 for a £72,500 fee, lifting two League Cups, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.As well as the dark blue of Dundee, Hall of Famer Gilzean earned 22 Scotland caps between 1963 and 1971, bagging 12 goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f13f2179a.jpg ","title":"dundee people all aboard thehms unicornfor family fun","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSwashbuckling pirates stormed the HMS Unicorn as people of all ages turned out for the vessel’s summer family fun day.Youngsters dressed up and got the chance to meet unofficial mascot Pirate Bob.Children also had their faces painted and took part in sand art activities.There was even a special curator’s tour of the Music of Maritime Life.Billy Rough, education officer at the Unicorn, said: “It was such a fantastic day.“It was incredibly busy despite it being a glorious sunny day.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f0eac1ff6.jpg ","title":"dundee people pop up shop peps up charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA pop-up ladies boutique in Broughty Ferry has raised several thousand pounds for charity.The shop in Gray Street has raised £7,600 for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust (CFT) in just two weeks.Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and other organs.Morag Beckett, who set up the shop, said: “It’s been brilliant.

The full eclipse will then end at 00.28am on Saturday.“Dundee Law will probably be the best place to watch the lunar eclipse.At moonrise, you will be able to see the start from the east, looking towards Broughty Ferry.“As the Dundee Law is the highest point in the city, you are bound to get great views of the total lunar eclipse.“Balgay Hill is another great place to watch the eclipse from.“I spoke with Mills Observatory and unfortunately they will not be opening for the lunar eclipse.“However, Balgay Hill will still be a great place to view it. You just need to look east and you should see it rise above Broughty Ferry.“The Tay Road Bridge or somewhere across the Tay would be another ideal spot although lower than the Law and Balgay Hill.“Observers should still have a great view as it continues to rise above the horizon.” A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly behind the Earth and into its shadow.This can occur only when the sun, Earth and the moon are aligned exactly with the planet in between.It can occur only on the night of a full moon.The type and length of an eclipse depends on the moon’s proximity to either node of its orbit.During a total lunar eclipse, Earth completely blocks direct sunlight from reaching the moon.The only light reflected from the lunar surface has been refracted by Earth’s atmosphere.This light appears reddish for the same reason that a sunset or sunrise does.Due to this reddish colour, a totally eclipsed moon is sometimes called a blood moon.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b505bfa5c48b-737x564.jpg ","title":"give alan gilzean a proper dens park send off says dundee ace cammy kerr","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee favourite Cammy Kerr has called on the club’s supporters to give Alan Gilzean the send off the Dens legend deserves this weekend.The Dark Blues take on Dunfermline this Sunday in the first home game since Gilzean passed away at the age of 79.The club legend’s funeral takes place tomorrow and Sunday’s clash promises to be one full of emotion for everyone associated with Dundee.A special matchday programme will be available while there will be a minute’s silence and black armbands worn by the players but Kerr expects a bumper home crowd to give Gilzean a roaring send-off.The 22-year-old said: “It’s a terrible thing to happen.“Sadly, I never got to see him play or have the privilege of meeting him but what a figure to have played at this football club.“To know you are at the same football club as some of the greatest footballers have played at is fantastic.“I’d like to send my regards and best wishes to his family at this time, obviously a tough time.“In terms of the game, I think it will be emotional and, hopefully, the crowd turn out for a very special player for this football club.“I’ve read a few of things in the papers about the player he was and I actually remember watching the thing on TV at White Hart Lane when they closed the old stadium.“I knew he was a good player but I didn’t know how big he was for Tottenham.“When they said ‘The Original King of White Hart Lane, Alan Gilzean’ it just shows the regard he was held in down there.“Naming a lounge after him doesn’t do him justice because he was, obviously, a great talent.”Being a fan himself, Kerr knows the kind of supporters Dundee have and the loyalty they show their team – something he experienced in a very noisy welcome and send-off at last week’s friendly against Farense in Portugal.“We could hear them when we got off the bus in Albufeira but you can’t see how many there were,” Kerr added.“At the end I got a few photos and things and they were singing away.“The best bit was when we were leaving and they were all banging on the bus – it was great!“You see European games and all the fans waiting on the buses so it felt like that, it felt great.“For the fans to go across there just shows the loyalty that they’ll go across to Portugal for a friendly.

I don’t remember them doing that for Little Mix and I thought Rita Ora was on the same level as them.”An itison spokeswoman said: “We always aim to give our members access to the best quality experiences and today we’ve given several thousand people the chance to see the amazing Rita Ora live at Slessor Gardens.“In the world we live in, prices fluctuate across all industries whether that’s a meal out or a break away, going to an event or booking travel  – it’s part of today’s market place.“We want to see more people having a great time and we hope everyone going to the concert will have a brilliant night.”Itison also confirmed that multiple ticket purchases are being permitted.A statement from Lizz Hobbs Group Live, the promoter behind the Slessor Gardens gig, read: “itison are a new ticketing partner which we intend to offer an allocation of tickets to at the launch of a new event to benefit all ticket buyers for concerts at Dundee Slessor Gardens.“We are delighted that the allocation of tickets have been so well received and look forward to seeing everyone at Dundee Slessor Gardens on Saturday evening for what is sure to be another wonderful concert.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kharl madianga set to make first dundee start","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWith midfielder Glen Kamara expected to be missing for Dundee this weekend, Kharl Madianga is expected to get his first chance from the start against Dunfermline.The Dark Blues host the Pars in Betfred Cup Group D on Sunday with Finnish international Kamara a big doubt after a training-ground clash left him with a protective boot on his foot.The club are hoping the damage is minimal and the use of the boot is purely a precaution.However, it’s unlikely he’ll be risked for the weekend game with Allan Johnston’s side.That means French midfielder Madianga is in line for a first competitive start since signing for the club over the summer.The former French U/17 international joined the club from Bulgarian side Lokomotiv GO – the same side Sofien Moussa was signed from.He made his competitive debut for the Dark Blues last weekend in the 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion, coming off the bench for fellow-new boy Elton Ngwatala.And manager Neil McCann said after that game Madianga was one Dundee fans should look forward to seeing in action.“Kharl came on and showed glimpses as well, he’s a fantastic player so in the midfield I think we have some real exciting talent in there,” the Dens gaffer said.Also missing at the moment for Dundee is winger Roarie Deacon.He’s continuing his recovery from ankle surgery and is expected to be out for a while yet.Club skipper Darren O’Dea missed the win at Stirling last week, and two friendlies in Portugal the previous week, with a groin problem.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b55a3b0d169e.jpg ","title":"tributes to dundee legend jim who dedicated 64 years to junior football","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTributes have been paid to Lochee Harp legend Jim Kelly who has died age 85.Jim served as chairman of the Beechwood Park Club for more than 40 years and was a popular figure among the junior football world.Jim dedicated 64 years of his life to junior football and developing Lochee Harp’s young talent.His son, Mike, who followed his lead and made more than 1,000 appearances for the club, said: “He had a phenomenal impact and was pretty much Mr Lochee Harp.“My dad took over the club when it was virtually on the verge of closing. He gave a lot of guys their first shot in the game and signed me too.“The Kellys are synonymous with Lochee Harp. Everyone knew him as a gentleman. Not everyone agreed with him but he was respected.”The club tweeted: “He leaves a massive hole in the hearts of his family and everyone connected to the club. Our thoughts go out to them and his wife Anne.”Before working on the committee and coaching team at Lochee Harp, he played as a junior footballer for local clubs including St Josephs, Alyth United, Stobswell, Downfield and also Harp.Throughout his time as a player, he competed in the old Dundee Junior League in the Forfarshire, Courier, Loftus and Keddie Cups.Shortly after being given a long-service award from the Scottish Junior FA in 2014, he told the Tele: “From there, it just seemed a natural progression to secretary and then eventually chairman. In actual fact, I don’t mind being tagged with being just a general ‘dogsbody.’”He received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Dundee City Council Sports Awards in 2016 for his service to Harp.Jim was treasurer of the Dundee Junior League and Tayside Junior League. Later, he served as finance and general committee member of the Scottish Junior FA.A passionate committee man with Lochee Harp, he initially resisted any attempt to regionalise the leagues: “Most local clubs were against it and myself, Downfield’s Alex Connelly, Charlie Fairfield of St Joseph, Broughty Athletic’s Eddie Whitton and others threatened to pull away and form our own league.“We could have done that as there were 12 teams in Dundee at the time. The SFA president came through to try to talk us round. We had a meeting with North End Park and were initially threatened with some form of blacklisting if we didn’t comply with the SJFA’s plans.”His son admitted his dad was modest about his achievements, saying: “He wanted Harp to be the best. He will be missed by us and the club.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-defender-jozo-simunovic-wont-learn-full-european-fate-until-after-rosenborg-first-leg-game","story":"                          Celtic defender Jozo Simunovic will have to wait until next Friday before discovering the full extent of his UEFA punishment."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-defender-mikael-lustig-jets-back-into-glasgow-to-help-ease-defensive-issues","story":"                          Mikael Lustig has jetted back into Glasgow in order to help shore up Celtic\u0027 defensive crisis although it is thought that there will be no cutting into the holiday time of Dedryck Boyata this week."},{"url":null,"title":"number-of-pubs-closing-across-the-uk-each-week-revealed","story":"                          CLOSE to 1,300 pubs have been shut down or converted over the past year as the industry suffers amid unprecedented cost pressures."},{"url":null,"title":"aek-athens-await-in-champions-league-for-winners-of-celtic-v-rosenborg","story":"                          CELTIC will face AEK Athens in the Champions League third qualifying round if they progress past Rosenborg."},{"url":null,"title":"spfl-confirm-make-up-of-two-reserve-leagues-ahead-of-the-new-campaign","story":"                          THE SPFL have confirmed that two Reserve Leagues will operate during the 2018/19 campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-glasgow-2018-championships-are-another-feather-in-the-citys-cap","story":"                          The World Cup, Wimbledon, the Tour de France \u0026ndash this summer has been all about sport."},{"url":null,"title":"3m-makeover-for-former-glasgow-printworks","story":"                          A CITY centre office block built on the site of a former printworks is set for a \u0026pound3 million makeover.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"bid-to-change-opening-hours-ruling-at-new-glasgow-harbour-site","story":"                          A MAJOR development at Glasgow Harbour is failing to attract new shop owners because of restrictive opening hours rules."},{"url":null,"title":"the-leading-contenders-for-the-201819-scottish-premiership-golden-boot","story":"                          Kris Boyd proved age is just a number with another prolific campaign in the Ladbrokes Premiership last season."},{"url":null,"title":"greggs-to-open-new-shop-in-east-ends-carmyle","story":"                          Greggs will create eight new jobs when it opens a new East End store this Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-fan-left-scarred-for-life-after-he-was-slashed-by-man-in-easterhouse-pub","story":"                          A KNIFE thug brutally slashed a Celtic fan who had earlier offered to buy him a drink."},{"url":null,"title":"style-service-is-a-scotland-first-for-ayrshire-opticians","story":"                          SPECTACLE wearers are set to be national style pioneers after an award-winning Ayrshire optometry group launched a new service."},{"url":null,"title":"tearful-five-year-old-creates-adorable-poster-of-lost-teddy-bear","story":"                          A TEARFUL five-year-old girl has made an adorable poster of her lost bear in a desperate bid to find it."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/ResizeCache/00125000/00125302-124x067.jpg","title":"Claims that electricity substation is affecting house values","story":"Residents in a remote Inverness-shire glen are challenging a power giant over a massive electricity substation that is expanding towards their homes.The 12 or so residents at Auchterawe near Fort Augustus fear their idyllic homes\u0026rsquo value has been slashed and the peaceful area blighted as the Scottish and Southern Electricity (SSE) substation expands to become one of the biggest around.\"From a tiny substation it is going to become an industrial site,\" said Steve Lanning who is leading the fight for compensation from SSE.\"For years SSE has been developing the small substation into what promises to become a huge facility. It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me.

stakeholders based on a range of economic, environmental and technical considerations.\u0026nbsp\"As a responsible developer, we have listened carefully to the feedback during consultation, and to minimise the visual impact of the extension, we are proposing a gas-insulated switchgear solution, which significantly reduces the footprint of the site.\"We have also purchased additional land to

but ownership \"cannot be determined\".The area is currently maintained by Highland Council but she said staff at the pub also worked to keep it tidy and litter-free.In a statement to support the application, she says: \"This piece of land forms part of the adopted road and, as such, we have lodged an application for permission to occupy the road with a street caf\u0026eacute.\"Given its proximity to an area of the town that has so much tourist interest, we feel we could make use of the land and that this would benefit visitors to the town as well as our business.\"The Castle Tavern is located across from the end and beginning of the Great Glen Way and, as such, we have a large number of visitors - walkers and cyclists.\"The beer garden that we have is small and we are limited in how many cycles we can accommodate. The only other place for them is on the footpath. This can cause restricted use of the path for pedestrians and customers.\"Our plans for the area are to tidy it up and improve the landscaping, insert some tables and benches and a secure area for housing bicycles.\"The plot, she added, would be serviced by the Castle Tavern\u0027 CCTV and be maintained to a high standard.There are also possible longer-term plans to install a charging point for electric bikes.\"The use of this land would be mainly seasonal as we do not intend to put any building on it and it would be used primarily for visitors who currently cycle or walk the Great Glen Way,\" she said.Inverness Central councillor Bet McAllister said she thought it was a \"wonderful\" idea for tourists and residents alike.\"It will be perfect for when the weather is nice and people want to sit outside for their meals,\" she said.\"The Castle Tavern is always very busy, especially their outside area.\"Cllr McAllister wants to encourage more restaurants and bars to utilise outdoor areas as long as they are able to ensure that people with disabilities are not impacted.\"In Inverness our streets can be quite narrow, so it has to be done properly,\" she said.Glad to hear that the move by the Castle Tavern could benefit cyclists, she added: \"The more bikes on the roads in Inverness the better the quality of air for everyone.\"Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 11:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116730.jpg","title":"New 40k artwork unveiled for Ness Islands","story":"\u0026nbspA \u0026pound40,000 artwork which would enable children to paddle in and enjoy the water at the Ness Islands is the latest offering from the Inverness River Connections project.\u0026nbspIf approved by councillors, it will consist of patterned sculptural stepping stones made of granite, sitting in a stainless steel channel or lade.Water from the river will feed into this channel where some of the stones will be fitted with moveable sluice gates to allow children to control the flow of water themselves.The plan is for it to be located in the middle of the Ness Islands at a spot already popular with families.The proposal is just one element of the River Ness Public Art Project, worth a total of \u0026pound727,000.Inverness Provost Helen Carmichael was yesterday hopeful that the concept would find favour with councillors on Highland Council\u0027 south planning committee, especially since local schoolchildren had been consulted on what they would like to see there, and Inverness College UHI design students had input on the concept.She said: \"Children were very involved along with students at the university. Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone.

The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 11:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116731.jpg","title":"New cinema proposed for the Black Isle","story":"\u0026nbspA THRIVING film society on the Black Isle looks set to take its next big step after plans were submitted for a permanent cinema to cater for growing demand.The brand new cinema, which would be located on the seafront in Cromarty, will cater to Cromarty and Resolis Film Society events and serve as a base for the town\u0027 increasingly popular annual film festival.Cromarty Estate, which owns the land, has lodged the application in partnership the film society, which would act as its tenant.The plans feature two key elements. The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.The cinema would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0027 growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country late every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.In a supporting statement submitted by the estate alongside its application, its agents said: \"A dedicated cinema space will allow screening all year which currently is not possible using existing buildings with poor black out facilities.\"The cinema may also be available for other users to hire for screenings, presentations and lectures.\"They added that the cinema would also \"ideally\" feature an outdoor area \"for summer screenings and festival events\".Making the case for new office space in the town, the estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"In a statement supporting the application, the film society said that a survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.Justifying the decision to proceed with an all-new site for the cinema, the estate\u0027 agents said the site\u0027 position close to adequate parking and its location away from homes were both positives, as was the existing vehicle access from the harbour.The buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.If the plans are approved construction could start as early as spring next year.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 11:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116735.jpg","title":"Pamiloo to make its first visit to Black Isle Show","story":"\u0026nbspCAMPAIGNERS have welcomed news that accessible toilets will be installed at this year\u0027 Black Isle Show \u0026ndash allowing people with complex needs to enjoy the event.Fiona MacLeod-Chiarini, whose brother Ewan MacLeod is severely disabled, contacted the show\u0027 organisers to ask about the availability of a Pamiloo (right), a mobile facility for those with profound impairments.Rod Mackenzie, the Black Isle Show\u0027 company secretary, immediately got in touch with the charity Promoting a More Inclusive Scotland (Pamis), which owns the Pamiloo, in order to make the event accessible for the family.Mrs MacLeod-Chiarini hailed the move, and believes facilities such as the Pamiloo can be life-changing.She said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the Black Isle Show have taken our concerns on board and have booked the Pamiloo.

It was in 1883 that Seaton Brick and Tile Company moved from Seaton to Torry, to part of the area now covered by Crombie Road.Mark said Torry’s bricks in particular were interesting for their arched shape.He added: “The clay from Torry was described as of ‘fine quality, and well situated for manufacturing purposes’.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

It is also the story of a family trying to reunite cousins on both sides of the Atlantic.Except this is not fiction. This is the mysterious story of James Campbell Hay Robertson, known as Jim, who was born and raised in Lochgilphead, and who was so determined to make a fresh start in America that he never saw or spoke to his Scottish family again.Why Jim would cut himself off from his family is something his granddaughter Morgan has been trying to find out and she has asked the Argyllshire Advertiser to help solve this mystery.James Campbell Hay Robertson was born in Lochgilphead and lived in Calman Villa in Ardrishaig. He was the son of the schoolmaster, a noted talent on the Lochgilphead football team and an aspiring doctor. Born in 1896, he had just turned 18 when the Great War began. He enlisted and, when the call for new officer candidates came, he signed up, becoming a \u0026#8216temporary gentleman\u0026#8217 rising to the rank of acting captain in charge of a battery of 4.5-inch Howitzers at the Ypres front. When the war ended, he spent six months in the army occupying Germany near Bonn.Jim was a smart boy, who loved his parents, and he was especially fond of his older sister Alexandria – a very talented pianist. She is often mentioned in the Advertiser as leading musical events in Lochgilphead, and was known as \u0026#8216Miss Lala Robertson\u0026#8217. According to Jim, she went off to study piano around 1910 in London or Edinburgh, but returned to Lochgilphead by the time the Great War broke out.After the war, Jim left for America and banished all of them from his life. It is here the mystery begins: what caused Jim to turn his back on his family and keep their existence hidden, from leaving Scotland in 1921 until his death in 1995 at the age of 99?Jim had a long and happy marriage and he and his wife Ruth had four boys who have grown up without extended family and under the impression that no relations existed in Scotland, which is not true. On a visit to Lochgilphead, Morgan found cousins in Furnace.Jim did share some clues about his family, but they were not all they seemed. He said his older brother William was in the Navy during the Great War, but had become an alcoholic, fallen overboard and drowned. This was not true. William\u0026#8217s signature was on their mother\u0026#8217s death certificate, signed in Aberdeen in 1943. William clearly lived a long life after Jim left Scotland and perhaps had his own family, themselves unaware of their American relatives.Jim\u0026#8217s telling of Alexandra\u0026#8217s story is even more tragic, saying she volunteered as a nurse in the war, fell in love with a South African soldier and left for Cape Town, only to die of food poisoning six months after arriving. This too was false, as the Advertiser\u0026#8217s obituary for their father in 1926 stated he \u0026#8216is survived by three children\u0026#8217, including Alexandra. Part of the story was true, however, as the Advertiser noted in 1920 that she married Henry Beck of Cape Town, in Dorset.Why Jim wanted to make a clean break with his family to such a degree he pretended his brother and sister had died will never be known. But it is possible his brother and sister lived long lives and had large families. Jim\u0026#8217s family in the United States now amounts to three surviving children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.Jim\u0026#8217s father, William Robertson, came from a family of printers and dyers in Bonhill, Vale of Leven, and served as a schoolmaster from 1883 to 1920. He died in 1926, possibly in Kilmun, and, according to family records, was \u0026#8216buried in Dunoon\u0026#8217, but this may be another red herring from Jim.His mother, Wilhelmina, came from a farming family in Aberdeenshire. She moved to Lochgilphead in 1874 when she was 14, to live with her uncle, Alexander Cameron Robertson, the new minister of Lochgilphead Parish Church, a position he held for more than 50 years, from 1876-1933.There is one picture which could help crack part of the mystery.

Donald Clark from The George said: ‘It’s good on games’ day to see so many well-kent faces and to see new faces doing well in the games.’Once face missing from the games this year was the Duke himself he and his family are currently in India celebrating his 50th birthday.The honour of chieftain of the games was given to Rear Admiral John Weale OBE RASM, FOSNI, ACNS(SM) who heads the Royal Navy in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Amongst the guests this year was a contingent of members of the German branch of the Clan Campbell Society.More than 4,000 people attended the games the numbers held up well against other years and the visitors were rewarded with fine weather.They saw two records broken on the track this year: Jax Thoirs from Glasgow set a new open ground record for the long jump at 21 ft 7 inches and Aiden Quinn of Glasgow took the open hop, step and jump to 47ft 2½ inches.Numbers entering the solo piping contests were, like many other games, slightly down. Opinion in piping circles is that resurgence in pipe bands is seeing more pipers choose bands instead of pursuing solo careers.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"fed up residents called action","story":"NewsFed-up residents have called for action to put the brakes on speeding drivers before someone is killedNeighbours hit out at fast drivers who are using the street like a racetrack.\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning07:00, 24 JUL 2018NewsCumnock.

Neighbours hit out at fast drivers who are using the town’s Emrys Avenue like a racetrack. The issue has been discussed several times at Cumnock Community Council. Community councillors say that an accident is waiting to happen unless something is done about the speeding motorists. Residents claimed that some motorists were driving at break neck speeds coming out of Emrys Avenue onto Ayr Road. One said: “Somebody is going to get killed. “They have 20mph signs in the street. “You would be better putting 200mph signs up. “They come out of Ayr Road. “It is getting beyond a joke and police say they are monitoring it. I have never seen them. “The speed is unbelievable.” A police spokesman who attended the meeting insisted officers have been targeting the area for speeding drivers. One said: “Two officers were out there from 5.40am to 6am. “They stopped 15 drivers and spoken to them regarding their driving. “The night shift officers were out and there was variety of folk going to work. “We were using education but we will still using enforcement. “A lot of the drivers weren’t aware of how fast they were driving at that time of the day. “I would rather use education first.” One resident added: “What concerns me is that at 4 or 5 in the afternoon come out of Ayr Road is like a race track and they are racing each other.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCumnockAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

The bride wore a strapless princess ballgown with cathedral train and sparkly cathedral veil. The 32 layered dress was MoriLee from J’Taime Bridal in Stevenston.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Prestwick Airport were delighted that the UK Space Agency (UKSA) continued to support their plans to be one of the UK’s three horizontal space launch sites. This follows the Space Agency’s announcement that Sutherland will be the UK’s first vertical spaceport, a significant step for the UK space industry. Prestwick bosses believe they are by far the most suitable spot for horizontal space launch in the UK in terms of location, capability and the thriving satellite manufacturing industry that exists on their doorstep. An independent assessment said most of the anticipated infrastructure required for space launch capability is already in place at the site, meaning that they could move speedily to achieve a licence once the legislation is defined. Airport bosses say the development of a spaceport at Prestwick is a real opportunity for the Scottish and Ayrshire economies. The spaceport project is an integral part of the Ayrshire Growth Deal and supporters say it would attract new investment to the aerospace cluster located around the airport, safeguarding existing jobs and creating many new ones. Stewart Adams, chief executive of Glasgow Prestwick Airport, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support we have from South Ayrshire Council and look forward to our continued collaboration with them and our other partners as we look to successfully deliver on our joint vision, a vision that places Glasgow Prestwick Spaceport as a centre of excellence for the space and aerospace industries. “We will be having further discussions with all our stakeholders to review our strategy and how to take our plans forward in light of the additional funding available. “We will also be talking to potential customers and launch partners willing to support operations at Prestwick.” South Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Prestwick is still the most advanced site currently in the running for the UK’s first horizontal space launch and we’ll seek to use the development fund to cement our position. “Our focus will continue to be on supporting our partners to ensure Prestwick can deliver the significant levels of jobs and investment that we know can be realised.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, said: “The case for Prestwick hosting this facility is a strong one, including the availability of a 2,987m runway and many aerospace businesses already on site with and land to accommodate more.” And MP Bill Grant added: “I am delighted that Sutherland in North East Scotland has been selected for the UKs first vertical take-off Spaceport facility and equally important is the fact that Glasgow Prestwick is still in the running for a Spaceport licence for horizontal take off facilities.” The commercial space sector is worth an estimated \u0026pound3.8billion to the UK economy over the next 10 years.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwick AirportSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12953553.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Craig-Ferguson-Promotes-American-On-Purpose.jpg","title":"talk show host holds giant","story":"NewsTalk show host holds giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansionAnd the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:23, 20 JUL 2018NewsStill Game stars Isa, Jane McCarry, and Tam, Mark Cox (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFamed American talk show host Craig Ferguson has staged a giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansion. And the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block. For Tam and Isa actors in Still Game - Mark Cox and Jane McCarry - were among those clinking champagne glasses. It was staged at his country mansion near Dailly which has become the Scottish seat of Ferguson. The party follows shooting of his new movie has been filmed in Argyll. Along with 140 cast and crew he was staying near Arochar while filming for ‘Love You To Death’ at locations around Argyll and Bute.  Stars include male lead Craig, Craiglang favourite Ford Kiernan and Liz Hurley Producer Matthew Weiner - the creator of the hit TV series Mad Men, said: “Our experience of filming in Argyll and Scotland as a whole has been phenomenal, we have never felt so welcomed and supported as Americans.” Sources say the party was a grand affair, with “lots of great people.” One guest said: “Craig really put on a show and his house is incredible. “As well as actors some of the Ayrshire gentry were there. They had a ball . . . and it was so funny to see ‘Tam and Isa’ there. “Craig is a huge fan of Still Game and appeared in it alongside Jane and Mark. “While Jane and Mark had no problem fitting in to the glamour surroundings, Tam and Isa would have been completely overawed.”  Craig bought his Ayrshire property for \u0026pound2million cash six years ago, bidding over the \u0026pound1.85m asking price. The 56-year-old was once the highest earning talk show host in the US, taking home \u0026pound8m a year. He fell in love with the mansion in the Girvan Valley and was keen to have a Scots base for his three sons. The house is 336 years old and has 14 receptions and 15 bedrooms over four floors. But it also boasts facilities fit for a Hollywood superstar with cinema, games room, billiard room, gym and tennis court. Craig has kept a low profile since, but four years ago popped up to watch the panto at the Ayr Gaiety with the family and wife Megan. Amazingly he actually trod the Gaiety boards 20 years ago in a touring show, starring with the late Gerard Kelly in ‘The Odd Couple.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"true-blue-mollie-honoured-on-her-99th-birthday","story":"PEEBLESSHIRE\u0027S longest-serving political campaigner has celebrated her 99th birthday this week.\nAnd Mollie McIntosh, who is also an active of her Walkerburn community, was sent a card and flowers by the Secretary of State for Scotland.\nMollie, who was awarded an MBE for services to her community in 2009 and was named Tweeddale Citizen of the Year the year before, has never allowed age to stop he working for both Tweeddale and her beloved Conservative party.\nBorn and bred in Walkerburn, she became an active member of the Conservatives when she was just 18 years old.\nPaying tribute on her birthday this week was MP David Mundell.\nThe Secretary of State for Scotland said: \"I enjoy saying to Mollie that she is one of our most active \u0027Young Conservatives\u0027 and she still volunteers her services to her local branch at every opportunity.\n\"She\u0027s a remarkable lady who has never missed an election in her adult life, both as a party volunteer and a voter.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town. It is important to safeguard our heritage for future generations, and recognise the influential role the railway has played over the years.\nIf you would like to be involved in the project, contact

As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":null,"title":"archer-statue-comes-to-musselburgh","story":"  The work of art is one of two which now has pride of place in the Honest Toun after a \u0026pound76,000 cash boost from Tesco.  The other is a giant stainless steel mussel shell, depicting Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history, which was recently put in place at Murdoch Green.  Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.  The artists were commissioned to undertake the work, which is being funded by Tesco with \u0026pound38,000 for each of the two sculptures, as part of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art Policy."},{"url":null,"title":"first-female-president-liz-excited-by-role","story":"  Liz Martin took the chains of office from Roy Symon at the Macdonald Marine Hotel in the town last Tuesday evening.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe area partnership is supporting the acknowledgement that the town is getting bigger.  \u0026ldquoFacilities and amenities need to be on the ball in terms of that growth to ensure that we have suitable and sustainable facilities moving forward."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8055467.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scottish-open-the-renaissance-club-to-stage-2019-tournament","story":"  This year\u0027s tournament is due to get under way tomorrow (Thursday) at Gullane Golf Club and, in 12 months\u0027 time,\u0026nbspwill move just three miles along the coast as it is played at the Renaissance Club, at Archerfield.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

Now the 29-year-old from Macmerry works with the likes of Hearts defender John Souttar, Motherwell star Chris Cadden and Rangers midfielder Greg Docherty on the mental side of their games.  He told the Courier how the drastic change in career came about: \u0026ldquoWhen I was a PT people used to come to me and ask for a diet plan or a training plan.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod say \u0026lsquohave you had one of these before?\u0026rsquo and they\u0026rsquod tell me they\u0026rsquod had seven or eight.

John, a former Ross High School pupil, initially worked with youth football clubs across the county while trying to make a breakthrough to top-level players. He said: \u0026ldquoI sent messages, filled out contact forms and heard nothing until this time last year, when John [Souttar] got in touch.  \u0026ldquoI think there is a bit of a stigma because it\u0026rsquos psychology and people think you\u0026rsquove got to have a \u0026lsquoproblem\u0026rsquo but it\u0026rsquos not about that.  \u0026ldquoI focus on three things: mindset, the player as a person and their performance.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.  During the engagement, Prince William watched a short film about the history of the NHS and listened to singing by the NHS Forth Valley Nurses Choir."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064994.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"rugby-stars-take-on-golfers-at-gullane-ahead-of-scottish-open","story":"  Scotland caps Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings faced off against South African Dean Burmester and New Zealander Ryan Fox in a \u0027rugby vs golf\u0027 challenge.\u0026nbsp  Kinghorn and Hastings kicked rugby balls around the championship course, while Fox and Burmester got some practice in earlier this week, with the rugby stars coming out on top 2-1.\u0026nbsp  Below is a video of the challenge. . .\u0026nbsp      Rugby \u0026#127386 Golf    With @LeuchieHouse and @MNDoddie5 as the official charities this week, we decided to have fun with a little #RugbyGolf challenge \u0026#127945\u0026#9971 pic.twitter/eCH0KBEjin  The Scottish Open\u0027s two charity partners this year are the My Name\u00275 Doddie Foundation, set-up by former Scotland rugby star Doddie Weir following his diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease and Leuchie House, the North Berwick-based national respite charity of which Adam\u0027s dad Gavin Hastings is patron."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8070351.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"all-the-latest-from-day-three-of-the-scottish-open-at-gullane","story":"  He carded a two-under-par 68 in his third round today (Saturday) to lead the tournament at Gullane Golf Club.\u0026nbsp  He\u0026rsquos a shot clear of a six-strong group that includes American Rickie Fowler, the 2015 Scottish Open\u0026nbspchampion at Gullane.

Fish said he was looking forward to the tour but added: \u0026ldquoIt is daunting \u0026ndash every tour is daunting.  \u0026ldquoBut we have got a super-duper German tour bus this time. I have pulled rank and it is a German bus and you can configure them yourself. I have got a double bed on the upper front lounge.  \u0026ldquoNormally, I sleep in a bunk but it is like a coffin. A tour this long means you need the rest and I have got a six-foot-four frame and need a bed, not a coffin.  \u0026ldquoI look forward to all the places. We have some really big gigs in Holland, the most we have played there in a while, and Germany and Poland have been really good to us.  The album will be recorded at Fish\u0026rsquos home, just outside Haddington. The musician admitted that brought its own challenges and said: \u0026ldquoYou are more easily distracted. In all honesty you can be working in the studio and then you go into the garden and do some weeding for an hour.  \u0026ldquoI enjoy it and like it.  \u0026ldquoI was doing a documentary for Sky Arts and we went to studios in Berlin and it was the first time I have been in another recording studio for a long time.  \u0026ldquoNowadays we have what we need here.  Beyond this year, plans are being drawn up for further tours stretching into 2020, when Fish plans to perform his farewell tour.  Fish, who is no stranger to television and film having appeared in Rebus, Taggart and The Young Person\u0026rsquos Guide to Becoming a Rock Star, is planning to put his writing skills to good use with thoughts turning to screenplays and possibly an autobiography."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8093106.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"belhaven-residents-fed-up-with-intimidating-hot-hatch-speedsters","story":"  Complaints about speeding vehicles and anti-social behaviour on Belhaven\u0026rsquos North Street, Duke Street, Back Road and Shore Road have been passed to East Lothian\u0026rsquos MSP Iain Gray and MP Martin Whitfield.

Dr Dockrill said: \u0026ldquoWork by archaeometallurgist Dr Gerry McDonnell, including analysis of crucible fragments and the floor deposits, has demonstrated that a copper smith worked in the building.  \u0026ldquoThe analysis of the floor enables us to say with confidence where the smith worked, next to a hearth and two stone anvils.  \u0026ldquoThe biggest surprise came when we lifted the larger stone anvil and cleaned it we could see carbon imprints of the smith\u0026rsquos knees and hands.

It\u0027s all Remoaner fantasies and Brussels scaremongering to try to get Britain to submit to the heel of the European Court of Justice and cough up the \u0026pound40 billion divorce bill. Except that this scaremongering isn\u0027t coming from Brussels, but from the British civil service whose job it is make contingencies. And they are right to do so. A no-deal Brexit is looking more and more likely, following the effective demise of Theresa May\u0026rsquos compromise White Paper last week.  Her attempt to remain in the EU regulatory environment by adopting a \u0026ldquocommon rule book \u0026ndash in other words, agreeing to replicate all the terms of our current membership while not actually being a member of the EU \u0026ndash pleased no one. It was condemned as \u0026ldquovassalage by Boris Johnson in his resignation speech, and a \u0026ldquonational humiliation even by pro-Europeans like the former Labour EU Commissioner, Lord Mandelson. The trade bills scraped through parliament last week on the back of a handful of rebel Labour MPs and the indolence of the current and former Liberal Democrat leaders who failed to show for a crucial vote on Monday. But amendments from hard Brexiteers have made May\u0026rsquos White Paper unworkable.  The Scottish Government hasn\u0027t commented on the no deal preparations, but it, too, will have to think the unthinkable. This week the Supreme Court will rule on whether the Scottish parliament had the right to pass a Continuity Bill, seeking to retain control over devolved powers like food, fishing and environment repatriated from Brussels. But this has been comprehensively overtaken by events. The Scottish Parliament was reduced to the status of a parish council last week by legislation that ran roughshod over Holyrood\u0027s legal right to withhold consent if it disagrees with aspects of the new trade agreements. No Sewel convention is going to prevent Scotland disappearing down the Brexit sink hole.  Now, when people talk of a no-deal Brexit they usually mean something like Britain \u0026ldquoreverting to World Trade Organisation terms, or a Canada-style free trade agreement. Wrong. No deal means no deal \u0026ndash it means no trade agreement, no two-year transition period in which things remain largely as they do today. No rights to travel in Europe for work or leisure without a visa, no common standards for medicines, nuclear material or air safety. Everyone will do their best to prevent relations with Europe breaking down completely, and people being hurt \u0026ndash but accidents can happen.  A no deal would be Britain\u0026rsquos biggest economic dislocation since the Second World War. Even a bog standard, free trade deal has to be negotiated and the one struck last week between the EU and Japan took eight years. And even when we have one, it will not be anything like Britain\u0027s current \u0026ldquofriction-free access to the customs union and the single market. There will be tariffs of 10 per cent on cars (so goodbye Nissan and Honda) and 15 per cent on average on food. But much worse will be all the non-tariff barriers to trade: like sanitary and \u0026ldquophytosanitary\" regulations [protective measures against contaminants] which could make much produce unsellable. Service industries, which make up 80 per cent of the British economy will find that they are not automatically authorised to trade in the EU. Banks and financial services will lose their \u0026ldquopassporting rights \u0026ndash though many have already jumped ship.  There will be a hard border in Ireland, or the Irish Sea, because there has to be one, despite what Theresa May said in Ireland last week. No dealers, like the Tory MP John Redwood, insist this is not necessary. \u0026ldquoWe don\u0027t want to set up any borders he says.  This is a new dimension in post-truth politics verging on the theatre of the absurd. The whole point about Brexit was to set up borders \u0026ndash that is what leaving the European Union means. And the UK\u0027s only land border with Europe runs right through the Emerald Isle. It\u0026rsquos 500 km long and has 300-odd crossing points. Moreover the Good Friday Agreement requires regulatory harmonisation north and south. Brexiteers seem to believe that everything will just continue as it does now, and that all those multilateral agreements Britain has entered into over the last 40 years will somehow still apply even as we leave the EU.  Right wing economists like Professor Patrick Minford insist that Britain will be so efficient, freed from Brussels red tape, and so low cost, that we we\u0026rsquoll still be able to flood their markets with our cheap goods and services. But that kind of Vietnamisation of the UK economy is not something that British people are quite prepared for. Brexiteers expect the \u0026ldquoanglosphere \u0026ndash the Commonwealth plus America \u0026ndash to give preferential terms to the UK. But countries like Canada and India are all much more interested in trade deals with the EU, not their former imperial master.  Remain-voting Scotland has been watching the slide to a no deal Brexit with mounting alarm. There was chaos in Westminster last week, as pairing arrangements were abandoned, Tory anti-Brexit rebels were threatened, and a clutch of die-hard pro-Brexit Labour MPs saved the day for Theresa May. It felt like being chained to a lunatic. Every constituency in Scotland voted to remain and the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for Scotland will be dire.  But not nearly as dire as it will be for the future of the United Kingdom.  Descent into no-deal chaos, or even the imminent threat of such, will surely lead to the collapse of the UK Government. Theresa May has been a \u0026ldquodead woman walking, to use the former Chancellor\u0026rsquos phrase, for over a year, and now she isn\u0026rsquot even doing that. With parliament deadlocked, and both the major UK parties opposed to a repeat referendum on Brexit, her departure should mean a General Election, as the Tory party spirals into a state of civil war.  In any General Election against the background of a no deal Brexit we can expect the SNP to return another super-landslide even greater than in 2015. Labour will be condemned for failing to defend the Scottish Parliament\u0027s powers, and for Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s refusal even to contemplate a soft Brexit solution involving continued membership of the customs union and single market. The Scottish Tory revival is already stone dead, and the Liberal Democrats are irrelevant. Scots will vote with fury for the party that has consistently opposed Brexit: the SNP. That could mean curtains for the Union, as Scots realise that they made a mistake in 2014. The Tory right better believe it: no deal means no more UK."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8109860.jpg?type=article-full","title":"preschool-children-taking-the-plunge-in-ever-greater-numbers","story":"  And now it has emerged that children are taking the plunge at an ever early age, with thousands signing up for swimming lessons before they even start school.  A programme set up to teach children how to swim has revealed that more than 5600 of the little ones taking part are aged between three and five - ten per cent of the total children involved.  Parents and babies have also been getting into the pool, thanks to the Learn to Swim National Framework for Swimming, which also runs introductory classes to give even the youngest children a feel for the water.  The Learn to Swim Framework is aimed at youngsters from birth to 11-years-old and provides high-quality teaching at least once a week through a series of lessons and levels over a number of years.  Currently programmes are being run at more than 100 swimming pools in 19 separate Leisure Trusts across Scotland, with 53,451 youngsters receiving lessons under the framework.    Duncan Scott  Athlete Duncan Scott, winner of six medals at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in Australia in April, has given the programme his backing, saying it was important to start simmers off young.  He said: \u0026ldquoGetting children into the pool as early is possible is best way to start to love swimming.  \u0026ldquoIt is fantastic to hear so many kids at such a young age are learning to swim.  Scottish Swimming, supported by Scottish Water, now plans get more young children learning to swim under the framework by encouraging them to start before they begin school.  Brian Lironi, Director of Corporate Affairs with Scottish Water, said: \u0026ldquoIt is already a fantastic achievement to have more than 53,000 children learning to swim but to know more that more than 10 per cent are children who not even at school yet is amazing.  \u0026ldquoLearning to swim is such an important safety skill and it\u0026rsquos vital the basics are learned at an early age. Safety both around and in the water is the paramount reason we\u0026rsquore involved in the Learn the Swim partnership with Scottish Swimming.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking forward to seeing the programme go from strength-to-strength, encouraging even more children and young people into the country\u0026rsquos swimming pools.    Scottish Swimming, the national governing body for a number of aquatic disciplines, is working towards the ultimate goal of ensuring everyone in Scotland can swim.  Local Authorities and Leisure Trusts have embraced the ethos of the programme, which aims to create more opportunities for children to learn to swim in a quality environment.  Another success of the framework has been the collaboration between local authorities, organisations and Scottish Swimming, made possible and enhanced through the support of Scottish Water.  Forbes Dunlop, CEO of Scottish Swimming, said: \u0026ldquoIntroducing young children to swimming at an early age brings a whole host of benefits for children.  \"The pool is a water based adventure playground for children to have fun, build confidence and learn new skills which they can use now and in future life.  \u0026ldquoWe want to try to ensure every child has a memorable, fun and enjoyable experience whilst learning to swim.

Celebrity chef Nick Nairn  The closure marks the end of a dismal time in the Granite City for the 58-year-old, who suffered facial injuries when he was attacked in Union Street while walking home during the early hours of the morning last December.  He spoke of his regret at bringing the shutters down on the pizza bar, which was set up in the same listed building as the Cook School in Back Wynd, formerly St Nicholas Kirk\u0026rsquos old church hall.  The decision was blamed on the economic downturn in the city since the collapse of the oil and gas industry, which Mr Nairn said had led to fewer people eating out.  Attempts to save the business by extending its opening hours and increasing marketing and investment failed to have the desired effect, and it was said that the bar was not viable as a standalone operation following the closure of the Cook School.  Mr Nairn explained: \"I had always wanted to expand into Aberdeen and the business had years of success with a loyal customer base.\u0026nbsp  \"However, the downturn in the oil and gas industry hit the economy in the north east leaving people with less money to spend on eating out.\u0026nbsp  \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos with regret that I\u0026rsquove had to make the decision to close my business in Aberdeen where I have enjoyed having a presence.\"  He added: \"I\u0026rsquod like to thank everyone who has worked with us in Aberdeen, and all our customers and suppliers with whom we have had an excellent relationship.  Johnston Carmichael and Morison\u0026rsquos Solicitors have been called in to manage the voluntary liquidation process.    Mr Nairn has been a champion of Scotland\u0027s \u0027natural larder\u0027  A self-taught cook, Nick Nairn was awarded a Michelin star for his restaurant Braeval, near Aberfoyle, when he was 32.  He later want on to front a number of TV series, including Wild Harvest, Wild Harvest 2 and Island Harvest, and represented Scotland in the finals of Great British Menu, winning the opportunity to cook his Scottish venison dish for The Queen\u0026rsquos 80th birthday banquet.  He currently splits his time between his cook school in his home town of Port of Menteith in Stirlingshire, demonstrations and consultancy work.  He devised the menu and lent his name to the Kailyard restaurant in the Dunblane Hydro hotel, and occasionally cooks there.  The chef said his enthusiasm for Aberdeen was undimmed after he was attacked last December.  He suffered a black eye and a cut mouth when he was punched in the face, and was knocked to the ground.  His publicist Julia Forster fended the attackers off with her handbag while members of the public helped make Mr Nairn comfortable. He was treated for his injuries at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\u0026nbsp  Afterwards, he said:\u0026nbsp \"I am sure it has been a painful experience for everybody involved and I am keen to put it behind me. All credit to everybody who helped at the time.\"  Oil worker Scott Smith, 35, was traced police appealed for witnesses and admitted the assault at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. He was fined \u0026pound900.  A spokeswoman for Mr Nairn insisted that the decision to close had been made purely on a financial basis.  She said that the pizza bar had been a successful business model, which had come under pressure because of the unique circumstances in Aberdeen.  She said: \"Nick will be back after this. We are currently reviewing other opportunities outwith the north east.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-and-andrea-leadsom-misled-mps-over-pairing-controversy","story":"  Shadow Commons Leader Valerie Vaz said the Prime Minister and Leader of the House fell short of the standards expected of ministers by characterising Chief Whip Julian Smith\u0027s action as an honest mistake.  Mr Smith ordered Tory Party chairman Brandon Lewis to break a pairing agreement with an MP on maternity leave during a crucial Brexit vote last week, but Mrs May said he had made an \"honest mistake\" and had apologised.  He had been \"paired\" with Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson, meaning neither would walk through the voting lobbies.  Ms Vaz, speaking during an urgent question on pairing arrangements, told the Commons: \"The answers and the statements made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House on the 18th July confirmed that the Government Chief Whip was less than candid with his fellow ministers, including the Prime Minister, by not declaring that he actively instructed Conservative MPs to break pairing arrangements.  \"It\u0027s clear that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House have unwittingly misled the House by characterising the Government Chief Whip\u0027s action as an honest mistake.  \"This is a serious breach of the ministerial code.\"  Earlier, Liberal Democrat Chief Whip Alistair Carmichael, asking the urgent question, said he was \"disappointed\" Mr Smith was not responding.  He said: \"There are serious questions still outstanding about the events of last Tuesday evening and the only person who knows the truth about them is the Chief Whip himself.  \"There is a serious lack of confidence today in the system by which we run our business, and the only person who can restore that confidence is the Chief Whip.\"  Mr Carmichael added: \"It may have been a mistake to cancel the pair, but it was not an inadvertence - it was a deliberate act.\"  Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said it was \"perfectly appropriate\" that he answer the question, and told the Commons the Government was \"committed\" to providing a pairing system as he sought to reassure MPs that \"the errors of last week will not be repeated\".  And he said Mr Lewis did not know he was paired with Ms Swinson, adding: \"He should not have been asked to vote, an error was made within the Government whips\u0027 office, for which (Mr Smith) has taken responsibility - hence his public apology to (Mr Carmichael) and to (Ms Swinson).\"  Mr Lidington said there was not \"some sort of deep-laid plot to deny the pairing arrangement\", and told MPs: \"Neither the Prime Minister nor the Leader of the House were consulted about the matter and the Government policy remains that pairing is an informal and voluntary arrangement between the political parties - we do take the issue of pregnancy pairing particularly seriously for the very reasons that have led both the business committee and then the procedure committee to highlight this as something which the House ought to address, and that is why we will be taking forward the debate on proxy voting in September.\"  Peter Bone, Conservative MP for Wellingborough, demanded greater transparency and called for a public list of pairing arrangements.  \"The problem is that until I came to this chamber today I had no idea there had been 2,000 pairs since the general election,\" he said. \"It\u0027s done behind closed doors and in secret.  \"If this pairing system was public and each day the people who were paired were listed - and in fact maybe even removed from the possibility of voting - then this would never occur again.  \"What we need is transparency and I hope the Deputy Prime Minister will look into this matter.\"  However, Mr Lidington flagged up the need for privacy for MPs who may be suffering health issues and insisted it was \"not always right\" for the arrangements to be made public, adding: \"I do think, despite what he says, it is best for these matters to be left for informal agreement between the usual channels.\"  Meanwhile, Labour MP for St Helens North Conor McGinn unsuccessfully called for the vote to be re-run, citing the precedent of a similar pairing breach when James Callaghan was prime minister in 1976.  \"He and the then leader of the opposition decided the only way to resolve matters was for the chief whips to meet and the vote to be re-run,\" he said.  \"Precedent has been set. When will the Government show the integrity I know he and many colleagues opposite possess in abundance?\""},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-the-so-called-liberalism-of-the-left-is-intolerance-in-reality","story":"  Actually, let\u0026rsquos stop there. The problem is always what comes after the \u0026ldquobut. \u0026ldquoI believe in free speech, but is almost always followed by some statement which demonstrates that the speaker doesn\u0026rsquot, in fact. Similarly, no one ever says \u0026ldquoI am a racist, but I think we should let them all in.  True, the Labour leader uses a variant on the \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom no racist, but technique, reaching instead for the apparently more inclusive conjunction \u0026ldquoand. His preferred formulation is \u0026ldquoI condemn anti-Semitism and all forms of racism. It\u0026rsquos difficult to see why the first four words of that sentence wouldn\u0026rsquot do perfectly well on their own, were it not apparent that a great many of Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos supporters see the next bit of the statement not as an amplification, but as a qualification.  If you doubt this, have a look at Twitter, where any suggestion that the Labour Party has any sort of an issue with anti-Semitism is met by howls of protest and abuse from Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos fans. These protestations often prove what they are trying to deny, because they frequently move rapidly from specious distinctions between Jews and the political stance of the state of Israel into wild claims that political parties, the banks, the media, or the capitalist system in general are run by a cabal of Zionists.  Mr Corbyn keeps assuring us that he would obviously like to distance himself from these racists, but\u0026hellip There we are again, you see. He never does so without some addendum.  So let\u0026rsquos judge the party\u0026rsquos problem by its actions under his leadership. Labour appointed Shami Chakrabarti to look into whether anti-Semitism was a problem, and she very quickly said it wasn\u0026rsquot. Then Mr Corbyn very quickly gave her a peerage.  The National Executive Committee suspended Ken Livingstone for saying Hitler \u0026ldquowas a Zionist until he went mad, then decided not to expel him (until he spared their blushes by resigning).  Mr Corbyn makes regular statements condemning Israeli government action, but has never condemned Hamas for firing rockets at the country less than a decade ago, as well as describing them as \u0026ldquofriends, he was calling for the group to be removed from Britain\u0026rsquos list of banned terrorist organisations, and appearing on Iranian state-funded TV after it had been censured by Ofcom.  A lot of Jewish Labour supporters, unimpressed by all this, staged a protest outside Parliament recently. And the party\u0026rsquos response last week? To draw up a policy that deliberately changes the usual definition of anti-Semitism drawn up by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which is accepted almost universally.  It deliberately omits or rewords such standard anti-Semitic tropes as claiming that the state of Israel is intrinsically racist, accusing Jews of being more loyal to Israel that their own country, comparing Israeli policy to the Nazis, and judging Israel (the Middle East\u0026rsquos only democracy) by different standards from other countries. Such as, say, the 18 Arab League countries which don\u0026rsquot recognise Israel\u0026rsquos right to exist at all.  For some, including the Chief Rabbi and many Labour members, that confirms the problem, and the failure to tackle it. It ought to strike every reasonable person as bizarre. Bluntly, if the Corbynite wing of the Labour Party isn\u0026rsquot racist, why does it keep weaseling away from the issue?  Part of the answer lies in the certainty of the Left that it is intrinsically virtuous. This belief is so deep-rooted that it persists in spite of any evidence to the contrary, which is what makes it so difficult to correct.  It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine people openly describing themselves as Nazis, and arguing that the Third Reich was a misapplication of fascism, which would otherwise have worked splendidly, yet Communists make this argument all the time. The fact that every one of the numerous attempts to implement Communism have led to economic failure, suppression of human rights and mass murder doesn\u0026rsquot seem to matter, because their intentions are pure, so it wouldn\u0026rsquot happen if only it were implemented properly.  This accounts for the hard Left\u0026rsquos notorious tendency to split into smaller and smaller factions, and readiness to accuse other groups of having strayed from the One True Way. It also explains the way in which Momentum activists, convinced of their own rectitude, can concentrate on attacking the perceived shortcomings of liberal democracies, while turning a blind eye to the actual racism and oppression of many non-Western regimes. Stairhead Marxists of the kind who think that Tony Blair is on the far right of the political spectrum are now in charge of the party.  But the assumption of virtue is pervasive even amongst less extreme figures who identify with Leftist causes. It has created the cult of the NHS, where what matters is its structure, rather than its results or wide provision of free care, the avoidance of \u0026ldquoelitism in schools and universities, and the insistence on public ownership of industries, even when it\u0026rsquos obviously counter-productive.  Liberal or \u0026ldquoprogressive causes which suffer from the same problem include well-meaning measures intended for our own good, such as the sugar tax or bans on the advertising of junk food.  It\u0026rsquos at first sight paradoxical that what often calls itself liberalism should so often be illiberal, but it is the natural conclusion of a smug certainty in one\u0026rsquos own political virtue. The belief that you are morally in the right very seldom has anything to do with politics, which is mostly a matter of entertaining doubts, weighing up the practical evidence, and trying to see the other person\u0026rsquos point of view.  The attitude that you can\u0026rsquot be racist because you define yourself as an anti-racist, or that human rights and economic realities can be disregarded if your motives are pure is the opposite of the genuinely liberal virtue of tolerance. Tolerance implies judgment it\u0026rsquos just that it doesn\u0026rsquot assume that the belief that someone is wrong creates a corresponding right \u0026ndash or worse still, a duty \u0026ndash to put them right.  It was CS Lewis who pointed out that \u0026ldquoa tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive, because the \u0026ldquoomnipotent moral busybodies imposing it \u0026ldquodo so with the approval of their own conscience. Coincidentally, it was Susanna Centlivre\u0026rsquos play of 1709, The Busie Body, which was the first to produce the rebuke: \u0026ldquoBut me no buts."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7704523.jpg?type=article-full","title":"demand-to-save-our-high-streets-as-scotland-loses-16000-retail-jobs-in-seven-years","story":"  The Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) made the discovey having tracked changes in job numbers, shops and retail turnover between 2008 and 2015, using Scottish Government data.  They found 16,000 jobs were lost across Scotland with just five out of 32 local authorities reporting an increase.  The SRC has called on local and national government to take rapid action to influence the pace of change and buy time for new investments.  CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said said more needs to be done to support business growth and long term investment to breathe new life into town centres including a \"more competitive\" business rates regime.    \u0026ldquoThe figures obviously give cause for concern, with many of the firms affected having a large economic footprint in local communities \u0026ndash particularly in terms of jobs. Not only are we seeing the sustained impact of tough conditions for retailers but also major changes in the way that people shop,\" she said.  Stuart Mackinnon, external affairs manager for the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Scotland, said it was time to re-examine the Scottish Government\u0027s town centre review to find out if public bodies are abiding by the \u0027town centre first\u0027 principle agreed four years ago.    \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos independent shops on our high streets are under pressure, mostly due to changing shopping habits, the collapse of many big retail chains, and the withdrawal of many big private and public organisations from our town centres,\" he said.  \u0026ldquoTo ensure that our local places are a success in the years to come we need more diverse local high streets with a broad base of retail and non-retail, big business and small business, and private and public.  \u0026ldquoIn some areas, there\u0026rsquos a glut of now empty chain stores but a shortage of housing or offices. We need to examine what the barriers are to putting these premises to better.\"  Among those bucking the trend were Midlothian and East Dunbartonshire with retail employment rises of 14.71 per cent and 2.78% respectively.  The average drop in shop jobs across Scotland was 6.3%, which Edinburgh and Aberdeen were above but Dundee and Glasgow fell below.  The worst falls were in Inverclyde, which lost of quarter of its retail workforce, and Falkirk, which fell by 27.27%.  The SRC found some link between falling shop numbers and a reduction in retail employment, with Falkirk having the highest reduction in shop numbers at 15.24% and Inverclyde shortly behind at 14%.  Across Scotland, only three local authorities - East Lothian, East Dunbartonshire and Midlothian - recorded a rising number of shops.  Ewan MacDonald-Russell, SRC head of policy, called for more action, including scrapping plans to charge extra business rates on out-of-town shopping centresand for more councils to use a discretionary rates relief system.  \"This analysis demonstrates how retail change is affecting the whole of Scotland, but in very different ways,\" he said.    \"For some communities this is leading to new opportunities with investment in new jobs, more productive and interesting work, and different business models.  \"However, we should not be blind to the serious repercussions these changes can have for local communities.  \"We are seeing shop closures and job losses which will reduce retail involvement in some town centres.  \"That change is inevitable, and presents a real challenge to government and local authorities.  \"They have the power to influence the pace of change, buying time for new investment and developments, but only if the scale of this transformation is recognised, and swift and coordinated action taken.\"  Scottish Labour\u0027s economy spokesperson Jackie Baillie said the figures were \"troubling\" and that it would look to support more retail apprenticeships and create a dedicated minister for small business as part of a plan to \"make the economy work for the man, not the few\".  \"The SNP has failed to support Scotland\u0027s high streets and small businesses for too long, damaging our wider economy and employment levels. That is unacceptable.  \"Scottish Labour has been calling for a retail strategy for some time now and the SNP has responded at a glacial pace. This level of complacency is shocking.\"  Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie added: \u0026ldquoWe need a transformational investment in education to deliver the highly skilled high wage Scottish economy of the future.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"We want local authorities to do all that they can to support businesses in their high streets, including giving full consideration to any request to use their powers to create local business rates relief or using any additional income they generate through the Business Rates Incentivisation Scheme.  \"We are doing all we can to support the Scottish economy, including maintaining a competitive non-domestic rates regime for businesses in Scotland and we provide the most competitive rates relief in the UK, worth around \u0026pound720 million, including the Small Business Bonus Scheme, which alone lifts 100,000 properties out of rates altogether.\"  The study also showed that Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow had fewer shop closures than the Scottish average of a 7.55% reduction while Stirling recorded a 9.23% drop.  Retail turnover analysis proved slightly more positive, with Edinburgh and the Lothians recording strong growth over the seven years of between 23% and 56%.  The Scottish average was a 8.8% increase but turnover fell in 11 local authorities, with Inverclyde the worse, down by almost half (48.76%)."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-set-to-enjoy-new-renewable-energy-boom","story":"  UK Ministers yesterday announced that wind power projects on some of Scotland\u0027s furthest-flung outposts will be able to apply for subsidies which would remove the element of financial risk that comes with building away from the mainland.  The amount of offshore wind around the UK is also set to double in the next decade after the Government confirmed support for the industry.  A new auction for companies to bid for subsidies for offshore wind farms will take place in May next year, with auctions every two years, providing up to \u0026pound557 million in support.  Island schemes will become eligible for a \"Contract for Difference\" (CfD) with the UK Government, which covers the shortfall between the cost of investing in infrastructure in remote locations and the average market price for electricity in the UK market.  This ensures electricity generators have stable revenues while customers are insulated against rising bills.  Many Scottish islands are ideal locations for the development of wind power given their naturally stormy environments.  Now ministers have announced that for the first time, onshore wind farms on remote islands such as Shetland and Orkney will also be able to compete in the auctions.  The move could deliver up to an additional two gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind per year in the 2020s, to bring total capacity up to 30GW by 2030 from current levels of 7GW in operation, and 7GW in construction or with contracts.  That will be enough to meet more than a third of the UK\u0027s power needs, boosting jobs and cutting costs for consumers, industry bosses said  Industry body RenewableUK\u0027s chief executive Hugh McNeal said: \"Boosting our ambitions for offshore wind is win-win for consumers, as the industry\u0027s success at cutting costs mean that offshore wind is now one of the cheapest options for new power in the UK.  \"Today\u0027s announcement confirming the budget and timing of new auctions, sets us on the path to deliver the tens of billions of pounds of investment that will be needed to meet our ambition of at least 30 gigawatts by 2030.  \"This is good news for domestic supply chain which can look forward to a pipeline of new offshore wind projects that will support tens of thousands of jobs across the UK.\"  The auction system has seen the price for electricity from offshore wind more than halve in just a few years to as low as \u0026pound57.50 per megawatt hour of power.  One scheme which could see a huge benefit from securing a CfD is the proposed Viking windfarm on Shetland, a 103 turbine windfarm being built by the community in partnership with power company SSE.  Shetland\u0026rsquos vast oil fund which was set up in the late 1970\u0026rsquos has a half stake in a planned 103 turbine wind farm on the islands which would raise around \u0026pound10 million a year for the local community.  UK Government Minister for Scotland Lord Duncan said: \"Wind projects in the remote islands of Scotland have the potential to generate substantial amounts of electricity and cut emissions, supporting economic growth and delivering lasting benefits for communities.  \"Enabling these projects to compete in future auctions will reinforce the UK\u0027s position as a world leader in renewable generation, as well as providing Scottish jobs in any projects supported.  \"I urge local communities, developers and other stakeholders to work together to ensure that such projects deliver lasting benefits to the islands.\"  Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said: \"The UK renewables sector is thriving, with more offshore wind capacity here than anywhere else in the world and 50% of electricity coming from low-carbon sources last year in what was our greenest year ever.  \"For the last decade the Offshore wind industry has been a great British success story: increasing productivity, raising earnings and improving lives in communities across the UK and today the sector gets the certainty it needs to build on this success through the next 10 years.\"  Sir John Armitt, the chairman of the Government\u0027s independent advisory National Infrastructure Commission, welcomed the announcement of a long-term pipeline of support for offshore wind, which he said would help give investors confidence in the market and maintain the UK\u0027s leading position in the sector.  But he urged: \"But if renewables are to make up at least 50% of our energy mix by 2030, I would urge ministers to go even further and extend this support to other technologies including onshore wind and solar power.\""},{"url":null,"title":"return-of-buoyancy-seats-gives-maid-of-the-loch-a-lift","story":"  The seats were part of the ship\u0026rsquos original lifesaving apparatus and were designed to float if the boat were to sink, giving passengers something to grab onto until help arrived.

In September 1987, Bob Kingston in No 10 wrote to inform her private office: \"I am concerned that, when the PM dozes in the official car, the design of the headrests is such that, far from supporting her head and neck, they cause her head to drop forward.  \"This is in itself hazardous, but when the car is braked or turned, or there is some other disturbance, she lifts her head very quickly, and this I am sure will one day cause at least minor injury.\"  He added: \"I told the PM of my concern at Chequers last weekend. She agreed to the matter of a better design of headrest being pursued.\"  The files also reveal the consternation among executives at Jaguar Daimler when Mrs Thatcher\u0027s successor John Major, who suffered from an old knee injury, suggested replacing the armoured Daimler, which he found too cramped.  In contrast, the official Rovers used by the Government Car Service were \"definitely more roomy\" and he jumped at the prospect of a \"stretched\" version which \"could add another four inches to its length\".  Hearing the news, Gavin Thompson at Jaguar Daimler wrote to a sympathetic MP, warning it would deal a \"catastrophic blow\" to the company.  \"The popular press would have a field day. Everybody in the country and around the world has become used to seeing our Prime Minister in a Daimler,\" he wrote.  Meanwhile, executives at Rolls-Royce sensed an opportunity.  Marketing director Malcolm Hart wrote to No 10 offering to supply up to three Bentley Mulsanne S at a \"nominal\" price of \u0026pound10,000 each - compared with a list price of \u0026pound80,000 - plus \u0026pound70,000 for the cost of armouring.  \"Our cars are exceptionally well suited to such use as they have plenty of interior space, can be entered and exited easily, are well suited to armouring, are capable of long-distance high-speed cruising and are, above all, essentially British in character,\" he boasted.  Officials noted that, at a total cost of \u0026pound80,000 per car, the deal offered a \"significant cash saving\" compared with \u0026pound110,000 for a fully armoured stretch Rover or for a \u0026pound128,000 Daimler.  However, there were concerns for Mr Major\u0027s famously down-to-earth image if they went ahead.

In particular he singled out Jack Jones, the general secretary of the giant Transport and General Workers Union, and Hugh Scanlon, the leader of the engineering workers.  In response to his call, senior officials suggested undermining those with suspected communist leanings through \u0026ldquoinspired leakages to the press.  The details are disclosed in a note of a meeting between the cabinet secretary Sir Burke Trend, the head of the Department of Employment Sir Denis Barnes, and James Waddell, a senior Home Office official, headed \u0026ldquoCommunism in Industry.  Dated March 5 1969, it is marked \u0026ldquoSecret and Personal with only one copy to be retained.

The officials were reluctant to act, fearing it could revive the controversy which erupted three years earlier when Mr Wilson denounced the leaders of a strike by seamen as \u0026ldquoa tightly knit group of politically motivated men leading to accusations ministers were using MI5 to spy on unions.  They did however suggest one possible course of action, noting: \u0026ldquoSir Denis Barnes said, however, that detailed exposure of Jones\u0026rsquo behaviour from time to time, perhaps by way of inspired leakages to the press, might be useful and productive.  The proposal appears to have come to nothing \u0026ndash something Mr Callaghan may have looked back on with regret when, 10 years later, the strikes of the \u0026ldquowinter of discontent were widely blamed for the fall of his government.  The file also includes a note from foreign secretary George Brown to Mr Wilson explaining how the English Section of the Foreign Office\u0026rsquos secretive Information Research Department (IRD) \u0026ndash set-up to counter Soviet Cold War propaganda \u0026ndash carried out such selective briefings.  \u0026ldquoBy discreet dissemination of such papers to trusted contacts, eg to various Labour Party officials at Transport House over the years, and to selected journalists, the English Section has done much to expose the activities of Communist front organisations in Britain, Mr Brown said.  The files also show how, in 1974, the BBC director general Charles Curran invited the IRD to brief the Board of Governors on \u0026ldquothe influence of subversive movements in the field of broadcasting \u0026ndash although,\u0026nbsp with a general election looming, officials were doubtful about the idea.  \u0026ldquoA leak that HMG was briefing the BBC on subversion might rebound in some perverse way related to the \u0026lsquoreds under beds\u0026rsquo aspects of the last election period, and at any time it could be distorted into allegations of attempts to bring political influence to bear on the impartiality of the BBC, one warned.  The files show that Mr Wilson was not the only prime minister concerned about subversive influence.  In 1985 Margaret Thatcher authorised the revival of the secretive Whitehall Subversion in Public Life committee \u0026ndash including representatives of MI5 \u0026ndash amid fears that the far left Militant Tendency (MT) was trying to infiltrate the Civil Service.  The prime minister was said to be \u0026ldquosomewhat disquieted to be told there were an estimated 1,400 MT members in the Civil Service \u0026ndash some in the ranks of management \u0026ndash who had shown themselves capable of causing disruption \u0026ldquoout of all proportion to their numbers.  Mrs Thatcher\u0026rsquos private secretary Nigel Wicks wrote she believed managers needed to be \u0026ldquovery ready to sack subversive troublemakers if they showed any cause under Civil Service rules."},{"url":null,"title":"how-john-majors-government-hid-the-cost-of-black-wednesday","story":"  Following the dramatic events of September 16 1992, Chancellor Norman Lamont was under pressure to spell out how much of Britain\u0027s foreign currency reserves had been used in the failed bid to prevent sterling crashing out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).  Publicly, Mr (now Lord) Lamont insisted no government would reveal such information, but papers released by the National Archives show that behind the scenes, he was \"increasingly anxious\" about the way the true state of the reserves was being concealed.  The failure to prevent the pound falling out of the ERM - which pegged its value to the deutschmark - was a personal humiliation for Mr Major, who, as chancellor, had taken Britain into the ERM just two years earlier.  As interest rates rose from 10% to 12% and then 15% on a single day, it dealt a devastating blow to the Conservatives\u0027 reputation for economic competence.  Figures finally released by the Treasury in 2005 under the Freedom of Information Act showed that in the course of August and September 1992, the Bank of England sold almost 40 billion dollars in foreign currency as the pound came under sustained attack from foreign speculators.  The final cost of the operation was estimated at \u0026pound3.3 billion.  The details of what exactly happened are spelled out in a letter to No 10 from Mr Lamont\u0027s private secretary Jeremy Heywood (now the Cabinet Secretary), dated November 26 1992 setting out the chancellor\u0027s strategy for rebuilding the reserves.  He explained the government had been able to disguise the amount of additional borrowing required, in part through the creation of what was described as a \"secret negative forward book\", to re-acquire foreign exchange through \"forward swaps\" worth around 12.5 billion dollars.  However, once the crisis was over, the opaque manner in which the operation was conducted meant the only way of running down the forward book was through a \"non-publicised\" programme of using sterling to buy back foreign currency - known as \"creaming off\".  \"In principle the forward book could be run down either by public borrowing or lower gross reserves but having consciously disguised this part of the September\u0027s operations it would now be very difficult to explain the real reason why we were now undertaking further borrowing or revealing lower gross reserves,\" the letter states.  \"That points to non-publicised \u0027creaming off\u0027 as the only acceptable approach - it is also the only way the net reserve position can be improved.\"  The letter notes that the Bank was \"very cautious\" about the tactic fearing it could lead to further falls in the pound, fuelling inflation.  In an accompanying memo, Mary Francis in the No 10 private office notes: \"He (Mr Lamont) is increasingly anxious about the way it is being used to conceal the actual state of the reserves.\""},{"url":null,"title":"unions-make-fresh-call-for-railway-policing-merger-to-be-scrapped","story":"  The RMT, TSSA and Aslef unions have all spoken out against the move, urging Transport Secretary Michael Matheson to speak to workers about their concerns.  Mick Cash, the general secretary of the RMT, warned the merger would \"jeopardise\" the specialist policing delivered by the BTP, and could leave taxpayer with a \"ballooning bill\".  He accused the Scottish Government of \"press ganging BTP officers into Police Scotland for political purposes\", while TSSA leader Manuel Cortes said SNP ministers were \"putting nationalist dogma ahead of the safety and well-being of Scotland\u0027s rail passengers\".  Mr Matheson, in his previous role as justice secretary, had spearheaded the legislation merging the BTP and Police Scotland through Holyrood - with the Railway Policing (Scotland) Bill passed by MSPs despite criticism from opposition parties, the unions and others.  The merger was due to take place in April 2019 but the timetable has been delayed, with a report setting out recommendations for a new date expected by August.  But now Labour is calling on the Transport Secretary to use the Scottish Parliament\u0027s summer break to rethink the policy.  Colin Smyth, the party\u0027s spokesman for connectivity, said: \"The summer recess gives Mr Matheson the opportunity to chart a different course for Scotland\u0027s railways once he returns to Holyrood in his new role.  \"Labour hopes that he listens to British Transport Police officers, and the rest of the industry, and bins this divisive policy.\"  \"Labour has consistently opposed this merger as it is unwanted, unnecessary and uncosted.  \"The gravity of the situation is underlined by this coming together of three separate transport unions, all pleading with the new SNP Transport Minister Michael Matheson to pause and re-think this plan.\"  Mr Cash backed that, arguing: \"The integrity and operation of an integrated national UK rail network should be mirrored by specialist railway policing.  \"The Scottish Government\u0027s plans to merge the BTP in Scotland with Police Scotland would jeopardise specialist policing standards, not to mention presenting the Scottish taxpayer, passengers, staff and operators with a ballooning bill for a sub-standard service.  \"We repeat our call on the Scottish Government to see sense and to re-start the consultation process on a more inclusive footing which seeks to maintain and improve specialist railway policing in Scotland, rather than press ganging BTP officers into Police Scotland for political purposes.\"  Mr Cortes said: \"Our members have been campaigning against this wholly unnecessary merger from the off.  \"Academics, the police watchdog, police officers, passengers and our members all agree that bringing together the British Transport Police (BTP) and Police Scotland is unnecessary, unwise and downright dangerous.  \"Sadly, it\u0027s clear that so far, the SNP is putting nationalist dogma ahead of the safety and well-being of Scotland\u0027s rail passengers.\"  Meanwhile ASLEF Scotland organiser Kevin Lindsay said: \"ASLEF and the other rail trade unions have been opposed to the BTP and Police Scotland merger since the idea was first floated.  \"We believe that this merger will bring an unnecessary risk to rail passengers and staff alike. We therefore support the calls for this proposed merger to be scrapped.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"We are committed to the safe and seamless integration of BTP into Police Scotland following Parliament\u0027s vote to pass the Railway Policing Act. This will deliver continuity of service for rail users and staff and a single command structure, with seamless access to wider support facilities and specialist resources.\"  \"Devolution of BTP was recommended by the Smith Commission, reached through cross-party agreement and integration will also ensure railway policing is fully accountable to the Scottish Parliament.  \"We have confirmed that our triple lock guarantee will protect jobs, pay and pensions for BTP officers transferring to Police Scotland. We meet regularly with all partners in the integration and will continue to work closely with them on addressing issues that emerge.\""},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-to-enter-talks-over-commissioning-hub-with-channel-4-after-losing-out-on-national-hq-bid","story":"  The city has missed out in its bid to host the new broadcasting HQ, with Leeds, Birmingham and Manchester instead short listed for the project.  Glasgow is now, with Bristol and Cardiff, in the running for one of two new \"creative hubs\" that the channel is to establish.  Channel 4 said the next phase of the process is to enter \"advanced negotiations\" with each of the cities in the running.  The creative hubs will include programme commissioning powers, hold up to 50 staff, and could be based in existing office spaces, although a new building is not, at the moment, being ruled out.  Glasgow is likely to consider the existing media quarter at Pacific Quay, where STV and BBC Scotland are based, a city centre space, or a regeneration area such as the Barras or Dalmarnock as potential locations for the creative hub.  It is understood that Channel 4 were impressed with Glasgow\u0027s bid, but noted that the city\u0027s bid had, among other issues, geographical \"proximity\" problems.  Although the broadcaster was apparently not strongly concerned about Glasgow\u0027s distance from London, where Channel 4 is to retain a major presence and which can be reached by air from Glasgow frequently, the channel is understood to have felt it was too far away from other potential \u0027 creative hub\u0027 cities if it became the national HQ.  Liverpool, which was short listed for both the national HQ and creative hub, lost out completely, being ultimately in the running for neither.  The Channel 4 guidelines for the national HQ said it should have a \"travel time to London up to 3 hours.\"  Stuart Cosgrove, the chair of the Glasgow bid said: \"Obviously we\u0026rsquore really disappointed not to be shortlisted for the National HQ, but the creative hubs are still a substantial prize and one that we\u0026rsquoll be working hard for.  \"We\u0026rsquove loved showcasing Glasgow\u0026rsquos great TV, design and music talent.  \"We already know Glasgow\u0026rsquos one of the UK\u0026rsquos cultural powerhouses and this has been a great opportunity to remind people of that.\"  Glasgow\u0027s bid for the main new HQ emphasised the city\u0027s independent production and digital sectors, the links between higher and further education and the creative industries, and the city\u0026rsquos social diversity, as well as the city\u0027s oft-quoted irreverent attitude.  The announcement follows the second stage of the pitch process over June and July.  Channel 4\u0027s chief executive, Alex Mahon, its chief commercial officer, Jonathan Allan, and chief marketing and communications officer, Dan Brooke, visited the 13 shortlisted cities for presentations and discussions.  Now the broadcaster will begin negotiations with the final six cities involved.  The locations for the new national base, which will have about 200 staff, and two creative hubs will be announced in the autumn.  Jonathan Allan, chief commercial officer of Channel 4, said: \"Our visits to the 13 shortlisted cities over the last month were incredibly inspiring and I\u0026rsquod like to thank all of those involved for the huge amounts of creativity they demonstrated and the excitement for Channel 4 and what we could achieve together.  \"We have again had to take some very difficult decisions on which cities to take forward to the next stage, but we believe the six cities we have selected are best able to deliver against our vision and requirements for the new National HQ and Creative Hubs.

SNP Defence spokesman Stewart McDonald MP said that news was \"utterly shocking\".    He said:\u0026lsquo\u0026rsquoSuspending this vital programme on the very last day of parliament is the kind of thing we have grown to expect from this deeply cynical untrustworthy government \u0026ndash but it is still utterly shocking.  \"The Ministry of Defence has been unable to answer the most basic questions about the cost of this new Type 31e frigates and today they have had to own up to their own chaotic failures.  \u0026lsquo\u0026rsquoThis has deeply serious consequences for our naval defence capabilities and the future of the shipbuilding across the UK.  \u0026lsquo\u0026rsquoTime after time the Tories make claims about shipbuilding being safe in their hands only for the workforces to be hammered by u turns - lies and broken promises.

Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson said during the 2016\u0026nbspHolyrood\u0026nbspelection campaign\u0026nbspthat the \"light frigate order\" would definitely be going to the Clyde.

The decision to move to Type 31e came after the MoD undertook a shake up two years ago of how warships will be built for the Royal Navy that aimed to spread the work around the country.  Proposals floated by industrialist Sir John Parker in his review of the sector in 2016 were backed by the Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon in a move intended to deliver budget vessels to the British military that are also aimed at being attractive to foreign buyers.  Under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, Britain were to buy five \u0026ldquoType 31e general purpose frigates \u0026ndash a cut-price warship \u0026ndash to bolster the Royal Navy\u0026rsquos depleted fleet, with the first one intended to enter service in 2023.

This saw giant blocks fabricated at sites around the UK, before being towed to Rosyth in Scotland were they were integrated into the 65,000-tonne ships by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, made up of BAE Systems, Babcock and Thales working with the MoD.  Announcing the plan, the MoD said a \u0026pound250m-per-ship price cap had been set for the vessels, which were revealed in the last defence review when the Government said it would purchase only eight of the more capable Type 26 frigates, with the Type 31 making up numbers."},{"url":null,"title":"questions-piling-up-over-scots-tory-donations-says-snps-pete-wishart-as-david-mundell-insists-rules-followed-assiduously","story":"  The escalating row centres on the role of the Scottish Unionist Association Trust[SUAT], which has given the Tories in Scotland nearly \u0026pound320,000, and which is now being examined by the Electoral Commission, the elections watchdog, to see whether or not it is a permissible donor.

The business sells a range of holistic crystals and stones each of which are said to connect with the energy within a person’s body to provide remedies for ailments including fatigue, lack of concentration, clarity of mind, and stress or anxiety.                                                    The new store at 39 High Street - which opens on Friday, July 20 - will allow Joss to stock a wider range of crystals and other holistic products.         In addition, four workshops and treatment areas are available to be used by local therapists. Joss also plans to recruit his first member of staff.The store will stock small tumblestones, fossils and incense as well as larger stones including amethyst geodes which are to be kept in the home and are said to clear an area of all its negative energy.Items of jewellery handmade in Cambodia featuring some of the crystals available in the store are also part of the firm’s extensive product range.In addition, the works of three local artists will also be on display.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 11:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 11:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went.

The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues.

It has been credited with helping some people to turn their lives around.Confirmation that Mr Harper, who has also sold on the streets of Inverness, had found a successful new niche for himself came when he was handed a Scotland\u0026rsquos Top Seller accolade.Mr Harper, who has overcome major health challenges, averages around 160 copies a week. He has been selling the magazine on and off since it was launched back in 1991.The secret to his success is fairly straightfoward, he believes: \"I speak to everybody who walks past me.

As a result, Newton Road will be closed from July 19 at 7am to July 22 at 11am. And Dingwall No.1 in Craig Road will be shut from 7am on August 2 to 11am on August 5.Final installation and testing of the new barriers will also require fortnight-long road closures at both sites \u0026ndash Dingwall Middle from October 15 to 29 and Dingwall No.1 from October 29 to November 12.David Dickson, infrastructure director for Network Rail Scotland, said: \"These level crossing upgrades represent a significant improvement for rail and road safety.\"Our consultation work with the local community earlier this year indicated support for these improvements and we look forward to seeing them delivered.\"Our aim is to deliver this work with as little disruption as possible, however, we will require two short closures this summer plus two week road closures for each crossing to install and test the new equipment this autumn.\"Train services are not expected to be affected by any of the works.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 11:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion.

People living near Edinburgh Airport or under the flight path say planes leaving and arriving late at night or in the early hours of the morning are disturbing their sleep.            The airport has admitted the noise nuisance from night flights was an issue.            After meeting airport bosses Edinburgh West Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine said she had received assurances that they would be taking action to reduce night-time flights.She said: “There has been a marked effort by the airport to engage with the public and I am glad they are taking positive steps. Night flights and the disturbance they cause are an issue frequently brought to me by constituents. I look forward to seeing the package of measures the airport propose.”READ MORE: Glasgow man ‘humiliated’ during body search at Edinburgh AirportMs Jardine conducted a survey earlier this year, which showed 295 out of 710 people who responded said they were affected by night flights and 449 said they would support restrictions on further night flights. She said: “I am delighted the airport has taken on board the findings of my survey and the complaints of those who live near the airport and under the flight paths.Helena Paul, of campaign group Edinburgh Airport Watch, pointed out the new flights to and from Beijing, which started last month, were effectively night flights, leaving from Edinburgh at 11.10pm and arriving from Beijing at 5am.            She said: “Edinburgh is unusual as an airport in that it doesn’t have any operating hours restrictions. There are multiple flights taking off and landing between 11pm and 7am. Many of them are charter flights because it’s normally cheaper at these times. And a lot of cargo goes out at night.“People are being wakened up at 4.30am and once your sleep in interrupted that’s it.”She claimed a majority of residents would support a ban on flights during the night. “If Edinburgh Airport is serious about listening to the community they would listen to that. They could choose to operate their airport slightly differently  and not disturb people at night.”            A comparison of statistics on the number of night flights now and four years ago shows a steep increase in their frequency.The figures show a total of 138 take-offs and landings at Edinburgh between 11pm and 6am - the airport’s definition of night flights - during one week in July 2014.The equivalent week this month saw a total of 191 such movements between these times.READ MORE: Edinburgh Airport chief slams reader for written ‘attack’ on teamAn airport spokesman said: “We welcome Christine Jardine’s support as we examine how best to deal with community feedback on night noise.             “Edinburgh Airport consulted on the impacts of noise earlier this year as part of the updating of its five-year Noise Action Plan.“It was clear that noise at night is an area of concern in some local communities and we’re working with our airlines to explore how best to mitigate any impacts.“We should be in a position to discuss plans in more depth later this year.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772982.1532420956!/image/image.jpg","title":"edinburgh rated one of europe s best cruise destinations for 2018","story":"        Edinburgh is renowned for its medieval Old Town, historic castle and playing host to world famous events such as the Fringe and Tattoo.                Tourists flock to grace the Capital’s cobbled streets from all over the world to take in its unparalleled beauty.            Many would expect the majority of visitors to arrive by coach, train or plane, but there is one mode of transport which is potentially overlooked yet provides a crucial part to the city’s economy. With ports in Leith and Rosyth and anchorages in Newhaven and South Queensferry, Capital Cruising has welcomed 114 liners into the River Forth bringing more than 150,000 passengers to the city in 2018.            Upon arrival, these tourists are in easy reach of the Capital’s bustling city centre and experience its unique culture.This has led to Edinburgh being recognised as one of Europe’s best cruise destinations for the very first time.The Capital has triumphed over stalwart cities Amsterdam, Belfast, Bilbao and Lisbon to land the top prize in Western Europe.READ MORE: Edinburgh Airport pledges action on night flightsJohn Donnelly, chief executive of Marketing Edinburgh said: “Edinburgh is a world leading and increasingly globally connected visitor destination – and becoming Western Europe’s Top Cruise Destination, in an industry said to be worth around £100 million to the Scottish economy, is another fine example of our Capital’s universal appeal. We take great pride in welcoming all types of visitors, and those stopping off for a day can easily navigate the Capital’s history and diverse leisure attractions through resources like the This is Edinburgh website, which covers all corners of city, from Leith to the Old Town and all the way to South Queensferry.”            The award, managed by Cruise Critic, is based solely on consumer ratings and reviews posted to the Cruise Critic website in 2018.Cruise Critic boasts the world’s largest online cruise community, with more than 350,000 cruise reviews, covering approximately 500 cruise ships and over 300 worldwide ports. Edinburgh scooped the top cruise destination in the British Isles \u0026amp Western Europe category at the Cruise Critic’s 2018 Cruisers’ Choice Destination Awards.Cllr Kate Campbell, housing and economy convener, said: “Everyone who lives in Edinburgh knows that we live in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. We’re really proud of Edinburgh’s beauty, heritage, culture and many other attractions – but it’s always good to have that officially recognised.“Tourism is incredibly important to our economy providing around 35,000 jobs – so the news that we are a top cruise destination is very welcome.”            Plans have also been floated to build a new cruise liner terminal at the site of the former Cockenzie power station.Backers say the move would open the door to new ferry services to northern Europe, create much-needed jobs for young people in the area and boost the economy by attracting thousands of tourists.Rob Mason, head of cruise for Capital Cruising in Scotland said: “This is a significant global recognition for Edinburgh and we are thrilled with the award especially as this is feedback directly from cruise passengers.“Our cruise business is thriving and we are seeing our cruise calls grow each year.“We are the only operator to offer the closest cruise connection to the beautiful city of Edinburgh and we have invested significantly over the past few years to provide the most direct access for liners of all sizes to Scotland’s Capital.

We are delighted that Edinburgh has pipped so many other wonderful Western European ports to the post to be crowned the best destination in the British Isles \u0026amp Western Europe.

But what are the prospects for such a project, what form might it take, and what would be the political implications?                To help answer these questions, it is useful to consider some historical precedents. On occasions over the last century or so, at moments of national crisis, politicians of the main parties at Westminster have come together to form governments intended specifically to address the threat.            There are three particular examples that stand out. In World War I, a coalition formed first under Herbert Henry Asquith in 1915 and then David Lloyd George in 1916. Then, in 1931, faced with a sterling crisis, the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald collapsed and was replaced by a national government under his leadership. And in 1940, Winston Churchill came to power during World War II as head of a newly formed coalition.            Based on these examples and other aspects of the constitution, a number of observations about the current prospects are possible. First, the most important principle for the formation and maintenance of any government is that it possesses the confidence of the House of Commons (though that need not entail winning every single vote). The House of Commons can, if determined enough, bring about the establishment of a coalition government. And so long as such a government possesses that confidence, it can continue to function.Alternatively – and perhaps more likely – rather than the House of Commons taking a direct initiative, a deal between senior politicians could command that confidence. A national unity government against a no-deal Brexit, then, is plausible in as far as a majority of MPs appear to be opposed to exit without a deal coming about. Indeed, such an administration, if it were backed by all of the “anti-no-deal” MPs, could well enjoy an absolute majority in the House of Commons, unlike the current Conservative government, which is in a Commons minority and reliant on support from the Democratic Unionist Party.READ MORE: Joyce McMillan: New political alliance vital to stop Brexit disasterThe formation of a national unity coalition may also involve an existing prime minister ending one government and forming a new one (as, for instance, MacDonald did in 1931). Alternatively, it may entail a change of prime minister (as when Churchill first came to the premiership in 1940). In other words, this coalition, if it came about, could be led by Theresa May or by someone else. That person might come from the party providing the most MPs (like Churchill in 1940) but need not do so (Lloyd George from 1916 MacDonald from 1931). They could be a party leader (Asquith in 1916) but might not (Churchill in 1940). Much would depend on the circumstances of the time and the personalities involved: who was willing to serve under whom, whether a suitable leader other than the premier was judged to have emerged whether the existing prime minister was regarded as tainted and if so was willing to step down quietly, and so on.Then there is the more problematic aspect: party. The reason a national unity government is being discussed at all is that, though a majority of MPs appear to be opposed to a no-deal Brexit, they are spread across different parties. However strongly they feel about avoiding what they see as a disastrous outcome, they are influenced by other factors as well. The prospects for the formation of any coalition inevitably turn on relations within and between different parties.            Under the adversarial political system of the UK, and given a parliamentary voting system that can often lead to single-party governments, there is a greater resistance to this kind of collaboration than in many other European systems. In the period since 1945, there has been only one full coalition, that of 2010-2015, and it did not include the Labour party so doesn’t qualify as a national unity government.When they have come into being, national unity coalitions have sometimes been associated with serious party political splits, such as that which occurred in 1916 when Lloyd George supplanted his Liberal colleague Asquith as prime minister, or in 1931 when MacDonald opted to form a National government, breaking with Labour.READ MORE: Leader comment: ‘Sensible Party’ must take control of BrexitThe coalescence of the “anti-no-deal” MPs behind a national unity government, either at the request of May or as part of her replacement with a different prime minister, would seem to involve some kind of fissure in at least one of the Conservative and Labour parties. While much would depend on the precise circumstances that triggered such an event, is seems likely that a sizeable proportion of Conservative MPs would oppose the initiative. It’s also unlikely that the present Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, would be the figure around whom pro-European Conservative (or indeed Labour) MPs could rally.            A government intended to achieve unity for the UK would therefore involve disunity for both the main parties (though smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats might potentially be able to join with less difficulty, though their recent experience of coalitions might be discouraging). The historical portents are again worth considering here. The Liberal Party was severely divided by the coalitions of World War I, after which it ceased to be one of the two main political parties. Labour was seriously damaged by the split of 1931 created by the formation of the MacDonald National government. Indeed, it took participation in the Churchill coalition from 1940 for it to return to office.The lesson for today would seem to be that national unity governments are difficult to create. And when they do come together, the party political consequences can be divisive, extensive, and lasting. However, if an issue becomes pressing enough, even these considerations can be put to one side.• Dr Andrew Blick is a lecturer in politics and contemporary history at King’s College London.

Shocking, I know. It\u0026#8217s been ages since I\u0026#8217ve gotten any abuse from Scottish nationalists.                 Even longer since I dished it out. It’s been nice not waking up and immediately plunging into a state of panic if I have more than 20 notifications on Twitter.            But I was given a brief reminder of what some of my comrades continue to face last week, when former Commonspace trailblazer-turned-Sunday Herald news editor Angela Haggerty made the mistake of tweeting a New York Times profile in which I was, for the first time in my nearly 20 years in music, described as a “British” rapper.            The second I saw it, I immediately retweeted it, adding “I’ve never been called a ‘British’ rapper before”. Because it’s been so long since I’ve been in a scrape with anyone of an ultra-Scottish nationalist persuasion, I thought nothing of it. Then followed the inevitable misinterpretation that my tweet, about being referred to as “British”, was also attributing that reference to Haggerty – as opposed to the automatically generated New York Times headline. Confirming, at least in the minds of a few Scottish nationalists, something they had long suspected: Angela Haggerty is, in fact, a mole, working for the British State. Comedy ensued.There are a few layers to this that I must carefully unpack. The first is the fact I am, at least in part, British. I have a British passport, a British provisional driving licence and am guaranteed security by a British military. I live in a city where many of my fellows regard themselves as British. The UK dash in my Scottishness is not something that either bothers me or that I would dispute. Nor is it something I feel a need to either revoke or performatively purge myself of. If England pillaged the world during the years of the British Empire, then Scotland was looking on, holding her jacket. As I snapped out of a nationalist dwam, mid-2014, in which we valiant Scots were a uniquely oppressed class of maverick renegades, incapable of racism, it struck me that we may have entered our historically fiendish union with England in 1707 because we were too pished to carve out an empire of our own. Rather than some caged lion, we were more like the Richard Hammond end of a poorly balanced Top Gear equation.READ MORE: Rap tutorials help troubled Scots school pupils turn the pageHaving spent the last few months travelling the UK, I’m positive there are no significant cultural differences to speak of between Scotland and most of England or Wales. My commitment to Scottish independence is based solely on gaining proximity to the decision-making processes that impact my community and family. London has proven time and time again that it’s incapable of taking incoming calls. Interestingly, this cultural lop-sidedness, where London is concerned, also finds expression in the arts and why suddenly being referred to as a “British” rapper was strange. Understanding why requires a brief history of Hip Hop culture itself.             Hip Hop culture originated in The Bronx, New York, in the early 1970s. Comprising four pillars of DJ, Breakdancing, Graffiti and Emceeing, it emerged out of African American poverty and political exclusion. DJs would connect two turntables and, using identical records, create drum loops from the funk and soul hits of the day. These records often had sections where the song would “break down” singing ceased, guitars pulled out and focus would turn to percussion and horns, usually for around eight bars.This section was referred to as the “break”. By spinning concurrent records backwards, consecutively, DJs created “beats” for break-dancers to perform or do battle. These beats soon became audio-canvases to which emcees would rhyme or face off in tense, often hilarious and exhilarating verbal jousts. Hip Hop, at its core, was – and remains – about community, artistic expression and creativity and, ultimately, violence reduction creating a space for anger, conflict and aggression to exist without spilling over into something more serious.READ MORE: Watch SNP MP perform Brexit rap in WestminsterAfter the release of Wild Style and later Beat Street – cult films documenting Hip Hop as it swept the States – it wasn’t long before Hip Hop arrived here electrifying kids in lower-class communities, who identified strongly with its irreverent aesthetics, all-inclusive participatory ethic and pulsating sociocultural resonance. By the mid-80s, there were hundreds of ‘breaking’ crews operating in Glasgow housing-schemes alone.            After a brief pioneering period, when regional UK acts were more closely aligned – in part because so many imitated the Americans and there was no money involved – the UK Hip Hop community largely shunned its Scottish iteration. Which is why “Scottish Hip Hop” – specifically rap – became a separate genre. Not because it wanted to annexe itself from the UK (the opposite in fact) but because it was widely rejected by it.The idea of people rapping in a Scottish dialect was more laughable the further south you went. The idea Scotland could “do” Hip Hop was preposterous, despite being home to some of the best Hip Hop artists the UK has ever produced.In the context of music, I regard myself as Scottish because I’ve been conditioned to. And not by nationalists either – many of whom, ironically, berate me for being a “rapper” – but by an all-encompassing London-centric culture that subsumes not only the Celtic nations, but also many English regions, from which countless stunning contributions to Hip Hop have emerged – consistently dismissed or ignored for over 20 years. Hip Hop is about representing not only yourself, but also your “hood”. Which is why so many regional artists retain impenetrable dialects and obscure slang, despite commercial and cultural pressure to conceal or renounce them. I’m a “Scottish” rapper, not because I want to deny Britishness, but because I live in Scotland and perform in a thick, Glaswegian accent. It would be unthinkable to suddenly rebrand, throwing the very community that gave me a voice under the bus, simply because I’m enjoying some mainstream recognition.I’m a British citizen, tax-payer and feel a strong sense of connection to British culture, but I’m Scottish – something British Hip Hop won’t let people like me forget. And, as well as my dual national identity, I also identify strongly with Hip Hop culture a young, global movement which has its own unique and ever-shifting norms and values. Central to which is the thorough, fearless authentic expression of where you come from. Being called “British” isn’t anything to make a song or dance about. I’m at ease with it and understand why international media would refer to an unknown like me as such. But, when it comes to Hip Hop, I’ve always been (and always will be) a “Scottish” rapper."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772843.1532375112!/image/image.jpg","title":"ilona amos climate change response is now officially absurd","story":"        No sniggering at the back \u0026#8211 think of the emissions, writes Ilona Amos                Apparently we are due to reach Earth Overshoot Day on 1 August this year. That’s the day when humankind has used up our entire annual ecological budget, the point where our guzzling of natural resources goes beyond the planet’s ability to restock and regenerate.            This year we will have used up our quota two days sooner than previously, by the earliest date ever recorded.            For a bit of perspective, the overdraft point was 29 December in 1970. Unsurprisingly, though, it has been steadily coming around quicker as the population increases and we clear more forests, catch more fish and burn more fossil fuels. By 1988, the overshoot date had jumped to 15 October, and to 15 August ten years ago. The UK busted its own eco budget on 8 May this year, while the US went into the red on 15 March. This compares to Vietnam’s 21 December. Overall, we are now collectively using the equivalent of 1.7 Earths. If that’s not worrying enough, researchers are this week warning that the world’s oceans will be more acidic by 2100 than at any time in the past 14 million years if we continue to pump out greenhouse gases at the current rate, with dire consequences for marine life. READ MORE: Scotland hits climate target for third year in a rowMeanwhile, studies by the Zoological Society of London show the rate at which the world is heating up is a major driver of species declines, particularly in certain birds. If warming happens faster than wildlife can adjust, we are likely to see mass extinctions.This all comes as the UK basks in one of the hottest, driest and sunniest summers on record, and following 17 of the last years being the warmest worldwide.             Climate change has been named as the biggest threat ever to face mankind. There’s no getting away from the fact that we must step up global action to cut emissions and reduce our impact on the world’s ecosystems if we are to stave off irreversible climate change.In the meantime, perhaps we can enjoy a little light relief with a surreal new Scottish-Swedish comedy collaboration coming to this year’s Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Laughter is the best medicine, after all.Picture the scene. It’s 2031. Adele’s new album, 43, is at number one.

He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch.

Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nTuesday 24 Jul 2018 11:40

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nTuesday 24 Jul 2018 11:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_0946-e1530785665580.jpg","title":"harold davis 1933 2018 from the korean front line to footballing glory and a spot of fishing in wester","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nHis surname should in fact better reflect the Wester Ross area he’s called home for almost 40 years.\n“I like that to be known up here in MacKenzie country,” he notes from his home near Badachro, on the shores of Gairloch. “My mother was Catherine MacQueen Kirk, and my father was Angus Davis, though originally he was born Angus MacKenzie. The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH0607NCA.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

TRADES Council has recently reformed in a bid to give a voice to local trade union members.\n  \nSpeaking after the monthly meeting Communications Workers Union and Chairman, Lawrence Huston, said, Ballymena needs jobs not empty words.\n  \nHe also spoke of the great sadness of members as they watched the Michelin factory being stripped of the machinery that once provided so many local people with employment.\n  \nThe aim of the group is to discuss the challenges posed by a declining industrial economy, lack of opportunities for young unemployed people and the serious concerns that are being raised over Brexit.\n  \nLucy O’Hagan, a local NIPSA representative, and secretary to the group expressed the views of the group saying that there was a real feeling of despondency among local people as they tried to deal with the increasing pressure of the rising cost of goods and services while pay remained static.\n  \nThe group are encouraging local people to support the ICTU campaign “Better Work Better Lives”.\n  \nLexie Scott, Ulster Teachers’ Union representative on the Council, urged people to go to the campaign website www.betterworkbetterlives.\n  \norg/pledge-support and

John is a long established Councillor and his views have always been respected by the Party and its leadership.

Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time. We have lost a man of great intelligence\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

This was the first time in 32 years that the Twelfth celebrations were held in Donaghcloney.\n\nCarla Lockhart said: “We have once again been treated to a great cultural display on the Twelfth in Donaghcloney. I want to congratulate the officers of Lower Iveagh West Orange District and their organising committee, Donaghcloney Linen Greer Association. I know many hours of planning and preparation went into this event but to good avail. We had a real effort this year by the committee and residents of the village to ensure this was a week long festival and were treated to features for people of all ages with the Songs of Praise, A Drummers Tribute, a night of remembrance, the community fun night and then the Twelfth July celebrations. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“A great turnout of Orangemen and women, bandsmen, Lambeg drums and spectators with plenty of variety for children of all ages in the demonstration field. This is what our culture is all about. No one should be offended by it. I look forward to it returning again to Donaghcloney and I have no doubt that it will not be so long the next time.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"}]
