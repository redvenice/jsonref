Nilsen (pictured) wife of Man Utd\u0027s Victor Lindelof are staying at the Renaissance with the England teamEngland\u0027s players will be staying in the same hotel as the Swedish WAGs ahead of tomorrow\u0027s World Cup quarter final, MailOnline can reveal.Harry Kane and his teammates will sleep in the 196-room Renaissance in Samara where Sweden\u0027s wives and girlfriends will also be staying.But the Swedes are bragging they already have the edge after they were booked into Samara\u0027s only five-star resort - leaving England in a more modest four-star hotel. Sweden\u0027s FA President Karl-Erik Nilsson joked: \u0027You could say Sweden is one-zero up already.\u0027  His countrymen are in the Lotte Hotel, which opened in April, and is the best hotel in the area.   The hotel\u0027s sumptuous  fine food menu lists the amount of calories contained in each item for weight watchers - which even has its own caviar menu where a spoonful of Stugeon is available for £71 and a lesser \u0027Pike\u0027 variety for £16.Their players can also tuck into tuna with chukka seaweed salad, crab cake with tomato salsa, roast duck, creme of pumpkin soup with Kamchatka crab and cream cheese and tiger shrimp and scallop brochettes and a filet Mignion steak.          Harry Kane and his teammates will sleep in the 196-room Renaissance (pictured) in Samara where Sweden\u0027s wives and girlfriends will also be staying          England has been allocated the four-star Renaissance (foyer pictured) Hotel in Samara while their World Cup quarter final opponents are staying at the town\u0027s only five star resort           Sweden are crowing to have been allocated better accommodation than their rivals. Their FA President Karl-Erik Nilsson (left) joked: \u0027You could say Sweden is one-zero up already.\u0027Rebekah Vardy reveals the England sex ban has been lifted...Share this articleThe country\u0027s FA general secretary Hakan Sjostrand chuckled: \u0027Yes we also have caviar on the menu, but that will be OK as long as England have their fish and chips.\u0027 Meanwhile Gareth Southgate\u0027s men will be staying on the outskirts next door to an Ibis hotel with a McDonalds nearby and traffic streaming outside and fridge magnets are on sale in the foyer for  £1.50. The Renaissance offers a range of salads, soups, grilled meat and fish in its \u0027Terrace\u0027 restaurant with its most pricey item being a grilled steak for £22.           England boss Gareth Southgate had no say in the hotel, which was chosen by FIFAHowever, England\u0027s players rarely eat in hotel restaurants and have their own food prepared for them by an official FA chef.The 196-room Renaissance was opened in 2003 with rates starting at £70 a night compared to the more expensive Lotte where the cheapest rooms are £200. But the standard of cotton sheets and the fine food will be forgotten once the teams do battle for a place in the World Cup semi-finals.Mr Nilsson, who was wearing his country\u0027s football short and is a Wolverhampton Wanderers fan, said: \u0027 FIFA chose this hotel. So it is one-zero for us then.\u0027We do have caviar, but I am pretty sure they can manage without caviar and it will be a good game. Otherwise they are welcome to visit us. It will be a fantastic match between two great teams.\u0027He added: \u0027We had Netherlands and France in our (qualifying) group and we beat Italy in a play off. We beat Portugal last year in a friendly.          The Swedes are in the Lotte Hotel (pictured), which opened in April, and is the best hotel in the area where the cheapest rooms available at the moment are £200 per night          The Lotte\u0027s sumptuous fine food on offer even has its own caviar menu where a spoonful of Stugeon is available for £71 and a lesser \u0027Pike\u0027 variety for £16\u0027And we won the group of four here which had Germany in it and we have just beaten Switzerland in Russia who are ranked sixth in the world…why shouldn\u0027t we be confident?\u0027We also have the biggest respect for our opponents. But we go in to the quarter final in a very good mood.\u0027  The Swedish delegation have been privately meeting human and civil rights leaders in Russia and supporting their work. Mr Sjostrand added: \u0027 England have so many good players and they should beat us. But it would be so boring if life was always like that.\u0027He said the Swedish fans would support England if Sweden is knocked out and added: \u0027Harry Kane is a fantastic player and we follow the Premier League in Sweden.    Despite Sweden claiming victory in the battle of the hotels, Gareth Southgate\u0027s men will be hoping for a repeat of their heroics when they beat Colombia on Tuesday (pictured)\u0027I am a Manchester United supporter and one of my daughters is called Ester because of Manchester.\u0027 I also follow Ashley Young , Rashford and Lingard. England have so many good players.He said he expected between 1000 and1500 fans to be in the Samara Arena on Saturday evening to be supporting Sweden.He added \u0027To come here is a challenge because of a lack of flights and it is really expensive.\u0027We had 500-6000 people at our last match because it was in St Petersburg and it not so difficult to travel from Sweden. People came by car and by train through Finland.\u0027We hope for a great match and of course a Swedish victory. But overall, a fair match which will be great for the supporters and enjoyed by the world.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/10/4DF8318B00000578-5924913-image-a-22_1530869652502.jpg","title":"How Jesse Lingard Englands King Social Media","story":"    This tweet by Jesse Lingard this week assured his place as the king of social media in the England team, whose image has been transformed by players\u0027 use of Instagram and Twitter          He is now turning his footballing and online prowess into a strong brand, based on his distinctive goal celebration, in which he spells out his initials with his hands          He is now busy building a brand around his celebration and his nickname \u0027JLingz\u0027The public\u0027s love of the England team is a million miles from when Sam Allardyce lost his job as England manager  after he was filmed talking to undercover reporters posing as businessmen.Back then, confidence in the national team was at rock bottom.  But now, just two years on, England have rebuilt their public image, thanks to squeaky-clean Gareth Southgate and his squad of fresh-faced young players.Among them is 25-year-old Lingard, who, with four million Instagram followers, is at the head of a group of stars whose social media posts are watched by thousands of young fans.EXCLUSIVE: Sweden\u0027s WAGS will stay at the same hotel as the...EXCLUSIVE: Man dumped by Gareth Southgate\u0027s wife for England...Share this articleA social media hit this week came Jesse filmed fellow young player Trent Alexander-Arnold saying \u0027It\u0027s coming home\u0027 to him on the pitch after the Colombia victory.Lingard has also posted videos of himself dancing in his pants with Ruben Loftus-Cheek in the changing room, being shaved by teammates and celebrating with fans.Such videos give fans a players\u0027 eye view of the World Cup and take supporters inside the England camp in a way never seen before.     He is currently believed to be single after his relationship with Jena Frumes ended in scandal          Jena split from Jesse before tweeting: \u0027At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride\u0027          Lingard and Ms Frumes split up in March after she posed for steamy pictures in his shirtSocial media experts say his and other players\u0027 tweets and videos are building a new image for the national side, totally distinct from the days of \u0027dentist chair\u0027 drinkathons and Graham Taylor\u0027s \u0027turnips\u0027.Former Twitter head of sport Lewis Wiltshire told The Daily Star: \u0027If there is a player who uses Instagram better or more effectively than Jesse Lingard, I\u0027m yet to see them.\u0027These players are from a generation where they understand and enjoy this stuff.\u0027I\u0027m convinced it\u0027s at the heart of why this England team\u0027s public image is different from, say, 10 years ago.\u0027Mr Wiltshire says he doesn\u0027t believe a representative handles Jesse\u0027s social media for him, as with other players, which may be part of its success.The Manchester United midfielder could now use his performances in the World Cup to launch a strong Beckham-like \u0027brand\u0027.He has used Instagram to give fans a players-eye view of the World Cup, including video of him dancing in his pants in the changing room  He stays close to his grandmother and grandfather, who helped get him into football as a childThree weeks before the tournament, Lingard applied for four trademarks, three centred on his nickname \u0027JLingz\u0027 and another featuring his goal celebration, in which he holds his hands in front of his face and spells out his initials.He has since launched a clothing range, including caps, T-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with his goal celebration logo, which have already all sold out on his website jlingz.com.Andy Sutherden, head of sport  marketing at H+K Strategies, told CityAM: \u0027Jesse Lingard\u0027s team has acknowledged the fact that if he does well in Russia, there’s an immediate opportunity but one with a very short shelf life. \u0027They’re also understanding of the fact that people who become known for something different - think Crouch and the robot - extend their marketing appeal beyond the audience of sport.\u0027 Meanwhile, there are rumours that Manchester United bosses are set to increase his wages from £75,000 to £150,000 to keep other clubs from trying to tempt him away.

Veteran Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash (pictured today on Sky News) said the proposals left \u0027a lot of questions\u0027Another senior MP told the Telegraph: \u0027They should have spoken for Britain.\u0027They failed. They are selfish iniduals who put career before country. \u0027It is pretty bloody obvious they prefer their ministerial cars.\u0027Mr Gove\u0027s decision may backfire and destroy his rekindled leadership ambitions. \u0027His pretensions to being a credible leader have been blown to smithereens,\u0027 said one senior Brexiteer to the paper.\u0027He\u0027s a busted flush.\u0027 An ally of Mr Johnson said: \u0027There is no doubt we would be heading for an even softer Brexit had Boris not been around the table.\u0027 Anger at Mrs May\u0027s proposals was growing today.Veteran Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash said the proposals left \u0027a lot of questions\u0027 and warned the Prime Minister a confidence vote was unstoppable if 48 Tory MPs write to 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady.Sir Bill told Sky News: \u0027There\u0027s a lot of unhappiness.. is this going to be a proper Brexit?\u0027     Boris Johnson, pictured left, stunned fellow ministers with a four-letter dismissal of Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan during Friday\u0027s Chequers meeting after Mrs May, right, called for loyaltyToday\u0027s accounts of Friday\u0027s showdown revealed Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson stunned fellow Ministers with his four-letter dismissal of the Prime Minister\u0027s plan at Friday\u0027s special Chequers summit designed to unite the Cabinet. His comment risks making him the first victim of Mrs May\u0027s fresh crackdown on dissent.Mr Johnson – who has been accused of betrayal by Tory Brexiteers for not blocking Mrs May\u0027s \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 proposals – spoke out against the plan for the UK to remain in Bline with Brussels rules in a new free trade zone with the EU.According to a reliable source, he complained that anyone obliged to defend the proposals would be \u0027polishing a turd\u0027.He added sarcastically: \u0027Luckily we have some expert turd polishers\u0027 – shooting a glance at one of Mrs May\u0027s spin doctors.Challenging the Prime Minister\u0027s new policy to her face, he said that her decision to try to \u0027align\u0027 UK trading rules with the EU would reduce Britain to the humiliating status of a \u0027vassal state\u0027.He also took issue with her cher-ished new customs plan, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA), claiming it would be a \u0027serious inhibitor\u0027 to striking new trade deals with non-EU countries.His outburst was revealed just hours after Mrs May tried to draw a red line under weeks of open dissent from her Ministers, vowing that from now on she will enforce collective Cabinet responsibility and sack any Ministers who defy her. Some senior Tories believe she may be forced to fire Mr Johnson.    The outburst was revealed hours after Mrs May threatened to sack disloyal ministersA Mail on Sunday poll today endorses her handling of the Cabinet showdown, with 33 per cent of voters supporting her Brexit plan and 23 per cent opposing it. The Survation poll, the first survey since the Chequers summit, suggests Mrs May has twice the support of Mr Johnson – although voters do not believe her plan is \u0027faithful\u0027 to the EU referendum result.Last night, Eurosceptic Tories said there was so much anger at the PM\u0027s \u0027sell-out\u0027 that some MPs would submit no-confidence letters to force a challenge to her leadership.And Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s pro-Brexit European Research Group said experts believe the Chequers deal left the UK \u0027on course for a \u0027black hole\u0027 Brexit\u0027 – meaning we would be sucked into the orbit of EU rules with no hope of escape.          Boris Johnson has launched an extraordinary four-letter attack on PM Theresa May over her Brexit plansMr Johnson made clear in the run-up to Friday\u0027s session that he was vehemently against any scheme which left us shackled to EU rules, leading to fears in Downing Street that he and other pro-Brexit Ministers could resign.But Mrs May launched her own plan to kill off his revolt: signalling in advance she had already lined up \u0027talented\u0027 junior Ministers to replace any Cabinet quitters forcing all those at the summit to hand over their phones to stop them briefing against her under the table and issuing an official No 10 communique declaring victory while her critics were still stuck inside arguing.          Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has accused Boris Johnson of raising the white flag over BrexitThis so-called Brexit deal is nothing short of a betrayal of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU. What on earth were the staunch Leavers in the Cabinet doing?Where was Boris Johnson? At Chequers on Friday, we needed him to emulate his hero, Winston Churchill. Instead, he gave us a modern-day version of Neville Chamberlain.Sadly, the Foreign Secretary was not alone in apparently waving the white flag of appeasement in the direction of Brussels. Other Brexiteer buccaneers and recent Brexit converts also jumped ship.The door to Mrs May\u0027s country residence was open but they chose not to walk out of it. Perhaps the threat of the withdrawal of the Government limo was just too great.This is a huge mistake on two grounds. Firstly, all those harbouring leadership hopes have done their ambitions fatal harm. Grassroots party members will have no truck with their perceived treachery. Some will try to keep their leadership hopes alive by claiming it was not the time to quit and they had a duty to stay on to ensure Brexit is not further watered down. But it leaves only one credible contender with the integrity and backbone to follow Mrs May: Jacob Rees-Mogg.Secondly, Brexiteer Cabinet Ministers are losing their nerve at the wrong time. This is not the end of the battle – it is the start of the real fight for a true Brexit. What Theresa May unveiled last week appears little short of a punishment Brexit, designed by the EU to dissuade any other country from leaving the bloc.With no incentive to offer non-EU countries free trade deals when we leave, through mutual recognition of standards, the UK will forever remain a captive market for overpriced EU goods. It means going through the pretence of leaving but becoming a non-voting associate member, a vassal state.We would still be locked into the EU\u0027s suffocating embrace via this \u0027common rule book\u0027 while the dead hand of the European Court of Justice will be lurking in the background.In contrast, we should call Brussels\u0027 bluff and, if necessary, leave without a formal deal. A so-called \u0027no deal\u0027 scenario may sound scary but \u0027no deal\u0027 does not actually mean no deal. It simply means the UK would trade on WTO terms which we use already to trade with most of the world.The fight to deliver a proper Brexit starts here and now. How Brexiteers\u0027 hopes were shattered by a single meeting"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/09/4E07B7C100000578-0-image-a-6_1531039254881.jpg","title":"Bulls runners endure slippery start second day Pamplona festival","story":"    Two festivalgoers try to hold off a rampaging bull as one of them struggles to get off the ground in the center of the city\u0027s bull ring          A man is carried aloft as he is smashed into by one of the rampaging animals inside the stadium complex on Sunday morning          An enraged bull smashes into a runner against the hoardings as several horrified onlookers watch on from the safety of the stands          A worried team of medical services personnel carry an injured man away on a stretcher after he was hit by the galloping bulls          A man receiving urgent medical attention in the middle of the street as medics hold up a sheet to cover the patient from the rain          A couple kiss in the street after the bull run is over and the streets empty out following the second day of the Running of the BullsPamplona bull run 2018: All you need to know about San...‘I thought I was in Pamplona’: Nine bulls ‘rampage’ through...Thousands take to the streets in Spain to protest against...Share this article    Terrified revellers flee in utter panic as the charging bovines head towards them with razor-sharp horns capable of goring          A man is sandwiched between two one-tonne beasts as the charging pack makes its way through the narrow city streets          Dozens of frightened runners scramble to get out of the way of a hulking bull as they fling themselves to the side of the cobbled streets for safety.

We’re winning, but it doesn’t feel like it.3.48pm The BBC shows great clips of crowds going absolutely nuts all over England when Maguire’s goal goes in. Croydon is by far the most wild and raucous – which is no surprise to me because Susanna Reid’s from Croydon and every night out we’ve had together is like that.3.57pm Remainer MP Anna Soubry randomly tweets me to ask: ‘Alan Shearer just said Sterling should “flick his balls”. How’s that going to help him score?’ I ponder a few seconds then reply: ‘Arousal is a proven contributor to performance.’3.58pm ‘Statto’ Lineker informs us that Sweden have never won a World Cup match where they’ve been losing at halftime. That’s comforting. Shearer adds: ‘No stupid errors and we’ve got this.’ That’s less comforting – we always make stupid errors.  That\u0027s my boy! England manager Gareth Southgate hugs midfielder Dele Alli after nodding in the second header of the match4.02pm A horse called Roaring Lion just won at Sandown. The stars, and nags, are aligning.4.03pm Jordan Pickford makes a brilliant save. Our very inexperienced goalkeeper is emerging as England’s superstar, something absolutely nobody predicted three weeks ago.4.06pm BBC Today Show presenter Nick Robinson tweets: ‘Is it me or is 1-nil the most stomach-churning score?’ It’s not just him. It’s all of us. We need another goal to calm the guts.4.15pm BOOOOOM! Dele Alli scores. It’s 2-0. It IS coming home! I leap from my chair and do a conga round the garden. It’s not a pretty sight but what I lack in technique, I make up for with enthusiasm.4.18pm Pickford makes another sensational save. Ross Kemp is back, still topless, and still screaming: ‘PICKFORD! YOU BEAUTY! YOU BEAUTY!’4.20pm Even the professionals are shedding their natural doubts. Former England striker Peter Crouch confesses: ‘Right, I’m all in, it’s coming home.’4.21pm I’m A Celebrity winner Georgia Toffolo is emotional: ‘I just cried, this is amazing, come on.’          Manager Gareth Southgate embraces Harry Maguire after one of his goals saw England through to the semis4.22pm Maguire misses a sitter… ‘How can he get that timing so wrong when he’s being paid so much to play?’ my sister demands to know from her perch on the sofa. I’m the least opinionated member of my family.4.28pm Pickford saves us yet again. He is definitely getting a statue, probably just for this match. The clock’s ticking down, and so are my shredded nerves. It’s torture, yet I’m beginning to see a tiny light at the end of the dark tunnel of tension.4.30pm Alli goes off, very, very slowly. I love his time-wasting just as much as I would hate it if I were Swedish.4.41pm The camera pans to a beautiful but distraught blonde Swedish female fan. England fans begin chanting: ‘You’re sh** but your birds are fit!’ I’m appalled with myself as I laugh out loud.4.44pm ‘Dare I say it, this looks like the perfect performance at the moment,’ says Keown. NO, MARTIN, DON’T SAY IT.4.45pm Comedian Jack Whitehall, a fellow Arsenal fan, is clearly wrestling with the same dilemma as me – how to a cheer a team full of players from our most bitter rivals. ‘I never thought it would happen,’ he tweets, ‘and I can’t believe I’m saying this… but I genuinely think Tottenham might be in with a chance of winning a trophy here.’4.46pm Sweden get a free kick in front of goal. My heart stops. But their shot balloons so high over the bar it will need Tim Peake to get it back.4.50pm The room bursts into ‘God Save The Queen’, for no other reason than we are all feeling ridiculously happy and patriotic.4.52pm It’s over. We’ve done it. It’s so weird, I almost enjoyed watching England play a World Cup knockout game.4.59pm An email arrives from my Army Colonel brother, serving his country in a less joyous part of the world. It’s his birthday next week and I’d sent him a box of cigars to make up for the fact he’s not allowed to drink alcohol. ‘Got back to my office after watching the game to find your gift,’ he wrote. ‘What perfect timing, guess what I’m about to do now?’ Happiness is a cigar… and England getting to the semi-final of the World Cup.5.05pm Southgate goes to applaud the fans as ‘All You Need Is Love’ booms out on the PA system. It’s a perfect moment. This smart, decent, impressive man has restored so much pride, dignity and grace to English football.And in doing so, he’s proven so many people wrong, not least the loud-mouthed pundit who said this after he was given the job: ‘There are a legion of better managers than Gareth Southgate in the world. \u0027The objective should be dragging the England team out of its abyss and dragging us kicking and screaming – under the tutelage of a brilliant, dynamic new manager – into the next phase of our existence. Instead, we’ve gone for the easy option, the cheap option by the strict criteria of: he’s got to be English and barely useless and I don’t get it.’That half-witted imbecile pundit was… me. And no, I didn’t get it.Because it turns out the brilliant, dynamic manager who has dragged us kicking and screaming into a World Cup semi-final is the guy I wrote off as ‘barely useless’.Gareth, or Sir Gareth as I suspect I will soon have to call you, I’m sorry.Now bring it home. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/00/4DFBD6DE00000578-0-image-m-48_1531007642908.jpg","title":"Prince Harry continue Dianas AIDS crusade Elton John","story":"    Prince Harry, pictured with his new wife Meghan, is expected to attend a conference on Aids The singer will argue that the global HIV epidemic is fuelled by ignorance, fear and homophobia.

Veteran Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash (pictured today on Sky News) said the proposals left \u0027a lot of questions\u0027Another senior MP told the Telegraph: \u0027They should have spoken for Britain.\u0027They failed.

His comment risks making him the first victim of Mrs May\u0027s fresh crackdown on dissent.Mr Johnson – who has been accused of betrayal by Tory Brexiteers for not blocking Mrs May\u0027s \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 proposals – spoke out against the plan for the UK to remain in Bline with Brussels rules in a new free trade zone with the EU.According to a reliable source, he complained that anyone obliged to defend the proposals would be \u0027polishing a turd\u0027.He added sarcastically: \u0027Luckily we have some expert turd polishers\u0027 – shooting a glance at one of Mrs May\u0027s spin doctors.Challenging the Prime Minister\u0027s new policy to her face, he said that her decision to try to \u0027align\u0027 UK trading rules with the EU would reduce Britain to the humiliating status of a \u0027vassal state\u0027.He also took issue with her cher-ished new customs plan, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA), claiming it would be a \u0027serious inhibitor\u0027 to striking new trade deals with non-EU countries.His outburst was revealed just hours after Mrs May tried to draw a red line under weeks of open dissent from her Ministers, vowing that from now on she will enforce collective Cabinet responsibility and sack any Ministers who defy her. Some senior Tories believe she may be forced to fire Mr Johnson.    The outburst was revealed hours after Mrs May threatened to sack disloyal ministersA Mail on Sunday poll today endorses her handling of the Cabinet showdown, with 33 per cent of voters supporting her Brexit plan and 23 per cent opposing it. The Survation poll, the first survey since the Chequers summit, suggests Mrs May has twice the support of Mr Johnson – although voters do not believe her plan is \u0027faithful\u0027 to the EU referendum result.Last night, Eurosceptic Tories said there was so much anger at the PM\u0027s \u0027sell-out\u0027 that some MPs would submit no-confidence letters to force a challenge to her leadership.And Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s pro-Brexit European Research Group said experts believe the Chequers deal left the UK \u0027on course for a \u0027black hole\u0027 Brexit\u0027 – meaning we would be sucked into the orbit of EU rules with no hope of escape.          Boris Johnson has launched an extraordinary four-letter attack on PM Theresa May over her Brexit plansMr Johnson made clear in the run-up to Friday\u0027s session that he was vehemently against any scheme which left us shackled to EU rules, leading to fears in Downing Street that he and other pro-Brexit Ministers could resign.But Mrs May launched her own plan to kill off his revolt: signalling in advance she had already lined up \u0027talented\u0027 junior Ministers to replace any Cabinet quitters forcing all those at the summit to hand over their phones to stop them briefing against her under the table and issuing an official No 10 communique declaring victory while her critics were still stuck inside arguing.          Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has accused Boris Johnson of raising the white flag over BrexitThis so-called Brexit deal is nothing short of a betrayal of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU. What on earth were the staunch Leavers in the Cabinet doing?Where was Boris Johnson? At Chequers on Friday, we needed him to emulate his hero, Winston Churchill. Instead, he gave us a modern-day version of Neville Chamberlain.Sadly, the Foreign Secretary was not alone in apparently waving the white flag of appeasement in the direction of Brussels. Other Brexiteer buccaneers and recent Brexit converts also jumped ship.The door to Mrs May\u0027s country residence was open but they chose not to walk out of it. Perhaps the threat of the withdrawal of the Government limo was just too great.This is a huge mistake on two grounds. Firstly, all those harbouring leadership hopes have done their ambitions fatal harm. Grassroots party members will have no truck with their perceived treachery. Some will try to keep their leadership hopes alive by claiming it was not the time to quit and they had a duty to stay on to ensure Brexit is not further watered down. But it leaves only one credible contender with the integrity and backbone to follow Mrs May: Jacob Rees-Mogg.Secondly, Brexiteer Cabinet Ministers are losing their nerve at the wrong time. This is not the end of the battle – it is the start of the real fight for a true Brexit. What Theresa May unveiled last week appears little short of a punishment Brexit, designed by the EU to dissuade any other country from leaving the bloc.With no incentive to offer non-EU countries free trade deals when we leave, through mutual recognition of standards, the UK will forever remain a captive market for overpriced EU goods. It means going through the pretence of leaving but becoming a non-voting associate member, a vassal state.We would still be locked into the EU\u0027s suffocating embrace via this \u0027common rule book\u0027 while the dead hand of the European Court of Justice will be lurking in the background.In contrast, we should call Brussels\u0027 bluff and, if necessary, leave without a formal deal. A so-called \u0027no deal\u0027 scenario may sound scary but \u0027no deal\u0027 does not actually mean no deal. It simply means the UK would trade on WTO terms which we use already to trade with most of the world.The fight to deliver a proper Brexit starts here and now. How Brexiteers\u0027 hopes were shattered by a single meeting"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/10/4E08C97A00000578-0-image-a-2_1531040434881.jpg","title":"Hilarious moment politics professors cat interrupts live TV interview leaping HEAD","story":"    Lisio decided to hop on Dr Targalski\u0027s head as the professor was being interviewed on live TV          But Dr Targalski was not phased by the cat taking up his new position and carried on speaking          He remained unperturbed despite the ginger moggy wrapping its tail around his head At one point the moggy wrapped his tail around Dr Targalski\u0027s face - but the academic was still unperturbed.Dutch journalist Rudy Bouma, who was conducting the interview, shared a video of the cat\u0027s antics on Twitter and it has currently been shared almost 9000 times.Go-cats!

The Prime Minister (pictured today in Maidenhead) won the backing of her Cabinet on Friday for a hybrid proposal that effectively creates a a common market on goods but would leave Britain free in other areas.He said: \u0027That is why we are working with colleagues in all parties  those who support a people\u0027s vote on the final Brexit deal, as I do, as well as those who want a Brexit deal that does the least damage to British businesses which keep people in work.\u0027Veteran Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash said the proposals left \u0027a lot of questions\u0027 and warned the Prime Minister a confidence vote was unstoppable if 48 Tory MPs write to 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady.Sir Bill told Sky News: \u0027There\u0027s a lot of unhappiness.. is this going to be a proper Brexit?\u0027   Tory Remainers have broadly welcomed progress towards a softer Brexit.Writing in the Observer today, Tory Nicky Morgan, who chairs the all-party Treasury select committee, says the proposed free-trade area \u0027sounds remarkably like the common market\u0027.In a dig at Johnson, who reportedly commented \u0027f*** business\u0027 when reacting to claims that some firms would take jobs abroad, Ms Morgan said: \u0027The cabinet have very deliberately chosen to listen to business and not swear at them or ask them to keep quiet.\u0027That is good for our future prosperity.\u0027          The letter urges MPs to \u0027put aside party political and ideological interests\u0027 by backing amendments tabled by the Conservative MP Anna Soubry and Labour\u0027s Chuka Umunna  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51acc2edcd18234f2885250d6a4e810c4226a75a/58_399_1902_1140/master/1902.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96e058bcacc583b73c032981e94619e5","title":"agence myop photographers at the arles festival in pictures","story":"For the opening week of the Rencontres Internationale de la Photographie, Agence MYOP photographers occupy an abandoned school in the heart of the old city and present 18 exhibitions of new and unseen work"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/490cd6699452c3a1bfce831d26415fbcfdec2a83/0_0_8858_8858/master/8858.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=27b54fd4b2d7dab4670b232b0861d612 2020w","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Cave rescue operations in Thailand, wildfires in Germany and England, the plight of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, and the drama of the World Cup in Russia – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3d21671429aa52619871f3c9156481ace2ec52b/90_0_2267_1360/master/2267.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b211b7521321c74bd3f72a591d8d7f35","title":"best summer holiday reads 2018 philip pullman maggie ofarrell nina stibbe part two","story":"From Pulitzer prize-winners to Penguin classics, poetry anthologies to the latest page-turners, here are the books to take to the beach this summerIllustrations by Leon EdlerI loved Andrew Sean Greer’s Pulitzer prize-winning Less (Little, Brown) and I can’t think of a better book to stash in your suitcase. It follows Arthur Less – who keeps emphatically reiterating that he is absolutely not heartbroken by his boyfriend marrying someone else – from San Francisco to Japan, to Italy and back again. Like a rare diamond, Greer’s prose sparkles, illuminates and cuts. I’ve also just been sent an advance proof of some new Lucia Berlin short stories, Evening in Paradise (Picador). Any publication of hers is a major cause for celebration, as far as I’m concerned. I might have to feign illness to devote myself to them. I’m hoping to pick up a copy of Lauren Groff’s new novel, Florida (William Heinemann), before I head off to the Highlands next week her last book, Fates and Furies, was a fascinating and febrile read. This one promises snakes, sinkholes and sisters, so I’m in.Rupert Thomson is an astonishing writer, who should be far more celebrated than he is. His latest novel, Never Anyone But You (Little, Brown), is immensely surprising, fully imagined and totally original. We live in an age of wonderful science writing, and Carlo Rovelli’s new book, The Order of Time (Allen Lane), is an example of the very best. Time is something we think we know about instinctively here he shows how profoundly strange it really is. Also, The Accident on the A35 by Graeme Macrae Burnet (Saraband): it’s a long time since I read a police procedural (more or less) that was so gripping and intelligent.For literary refreshment, try the playful, artful Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata (Portobello). For a properly sweltering read, you need One Star Awake by Andrew Meehan (New Island), all gorgeous longing and hunger in Paris. Those who can’t sleep in the heat might find the ingeniously disquieting stories in Things We Lost in the Fire by Mariana Enríquez (Portobello) apt. If I manage a couple of days off, I’ll head for Kerry on the Atlantic coast of Ireland and take Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now by Jaron Lanier (Bodley Head) and a recently delivered proof I can’t wait to get stuck into: Crimson by Greenlandic sensation Niviaq Korneliussen (Virago).If you like your holiday beach reads to include a measure of deep existential terror – and who doesn’t? – I am happy to point you toward Mariana Enríquez’s utterly brilliant short story collection Things We Lost in the Fire (Portobello). Instead of returning home with a tan, you will be likely to return home looking pale and haunted, and with your eyes sunken in your skull, but you will thank me for the tip. (Either that or you’ll curse me for it, it’s pretty much 5050.) Perhaps even less appropriate a beach read is James Bridle’s book New Dark Age (Verso), an extraordinary, perceptive analysis of the various ways in which the rise of information technology has obscured, rather than illuminated, the operations of power in the world, and diminished our capacity to improve it. It’s brilliant and bracing. The two books I’m most excited to read this summer – almost certainly not on a beach, though you never know – are Olivia Laing’s Crudo (Picador), and Jacqueline Rose’s Mothers: an Essay on Love and Cruelty (Faber), which I’ve just started reading and am very much enjoying.Two recent favourites are memoirs that use other books to tell their story. Sally Bayley’s Girl With Dove: A Life Built By Books(Harper Collins) borrows voices and themes from literary classics (eg Jane Eyre, David Copperfield, Miss Marple, Milly-Molly-Mandy) to make sense of the strange goings-on in her own family. I highly recommend the author’s exuberant reading of the audiobook for the full effect of this beguiling, eccentric, funny memoir. In her joyful memoir Bookworm: A Memoir of Childhood Reading (Vintage), Lucy Mangan revisits our most beloved childhood books (Milly-Molly-Mandy crops up again), brings the characters of our collective childhood back to life and uses them – with great wit and wisdom – to tell her own story. Wonderful. Another book on the transformative power of books is Educated (Hutchinson), Tara Westover’s fascinating, jaw-dropping memoir of being raised by a survivalist scrap-merchant who doesn’t trust medicine, schools or dairy products, and tells the story of her determination to find knowledge. My summer will be spent at home, on the beaches of Cornwall, and a holiday read I’m looking forward to is Human Relations and Other Difficulties – the collected essays (1972-2015) of Mary-Kay Wilmers (Profile), editor of the London Review of Books and my old boss.I spend my life in the third person watching characters shouting from the stage, so I’m most drawn to writers who show me something different or unusually personal with a whispering voice from the page. Julian Barnes’s completely devastating The Only Story (Jonathan Cape) is as quiet and aching and intimate as a James Blake ballad. Rachel Cusk’s Kudos (Faber), the third in a breathtaking trilogy, is its polar opposite, voiceless, disconcerting, secretive and utterly modern. Finally, I’ll take John Fowles’s adolescent, deeply theatrical, classic The Magus (Vintage), which reminds me of being a teenager hoping to find holiday romance and instead seeking consolation in a book.I’m enjoying books that present as memoir but with a beauty of prose that elevates them, so I adored Jean Hannah Edelstein’s phenomenal This Really Isn’t About You (Picador), a warm and witty account of finding your feet in the face of great loss. Andrew Hankinson’s You Could Do Something Amazing With Your Life (You Are Raoul Moat) (Scribe) is another gripper, a powerful literary experiment written in the voice of the killer. On a lighter note, for my trip to Los Angeles, I’m packing Cesare Pavese’s The Beautiful Summer (Penguin), with an introduction by Elizabeth Strout, a slender account of love in 1930s Italy, and 300 Arguments and Ongoingness: The End of a Diary (Picador) by Sarah Manguso, brimming with invaluable wisdom and elegance.Holidays are for distraction-free immersion in books with heft. Artist Hito Steyerl’s Duty Free Art (Verso) is a dizzying and dystopian riff on the liquid capital that flows through the art world, the factoids manufactured by bots and our accumulation of digital debris. Counter that with Practice: Documents of Contemporary Art (Whitechapel Gallery), an anthology of essays on and by artists ranging from Marina Abramović to Gerhard Richter and their strategies for making, doing and resisting the virtual. A book that reads like magic realism but is entirely factual is Naples ’44 by Norman Lewis (Eland), a riveting and cinematic account of how Neapolitans dealt with siege and starvation – countesses transformed ballrooms into vegetable gardens or simply took to prostitution, and the cat population declined dramatically – while keeping up appearances. I will be in the Tuscan hills this summer and I am taking with me Shape of Light: 100 Years of Photography and Abstract Art (Tate) to inspire my own photographic experiments.Melissa Harrison’s forthcoming All Among the Barley (Bloomsbury) gets you in the first sentence and does not let go I cannot recommend it enough. The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It’s Broken (Macmillan) is an eye-opening, funny and horrifying look at the criminal justice system, perfect for reading sections out and disrupting the lives of those around you who are “just trying to have a nice time”. I also will take These Bones Will Rise Again by Panashe Chigumadzi (Indigo), This Really Isn’t About You by Jean Hannah Edelstein (Picador), and Run, Riot by Nikesh Shukla (Hodder) with me for a week in a tent on the Isle of Wight.I heartily recommend Who Is Rich? by Matthew Klam (Fourth Estate). It’s the funniest novel I’ve read in ages and one of the saddest. The narrator, Rich Fischer, a once somewhat famous cartoonist, will please anyone who likes their protagonists clever and deluded, hopeful and doomed. I also loved Kayo Chingonyi’s debut poetry collection, Kumukanda (Chatto \u0026amp Windus). His poems are intelligent and moving and find the perfect balance between intricacy and directness. I’ve got lots of books I’m looking forward to reading on a beach in Gower: Flights by Olga Tokarczuk (Publishers Group), Hold by Michael Donkor (Fourth Estate) and Astroturf by Matthew Sperling (Quercus).Anyone who endured their teens in the 1970s as I did will devour Nina Stibbe’s sequel to the equally delicious Man at the Helm. Funny, subversive and unexpectedly touching, Paradise Lodge (Penguin), just out in paperback, follows her heroine’s adventures when she bunks off school to work in an old people’s home ripe for Thatcherite reforms. I’m always banging on about the need to read more dead authors – they have nobody marketing their work and they’re cheap and usually brilliant. Please discover Sylvia Townsend Warner this summer. Her The Flint Anchor and The Corner That Held Them (Virago) are neglected comic masterpieces whose evocations of chilly East Anglian landscapes are the perfect balm for sunburn. I’ll get no holiday as I’ve a new novel out, but on my train journeys I’ll be reading Anne Enright in preparation for interviewing her at the North Cornwall book festival.I’ll be in Berlin for most of July, heading there via – or at least in the company of – Antony Beevor’s Arnhem: The Battle for the Bridges, 1944 (Viking). Always worried that I have a book too few, I’ll also be lugging Lisa Halliday’s Asymmetry (Granta), Pond by Claire-Louise Bennett (Fitzcarraldo) and Iris Origo’s Tuscan diaries, War in Val D’Orcia (Pushkin). In the second world war, the Germans used 2.7m horses, of which 1.8m died. This is just one of many moving statistics in Ulrich Raulff’s unusual and stimulating history of – and elegy for – the last 100 years of our relationship with the equine world, Farewell to the Horse (Penguin).Who Is Rich? (Fourth Estate) by Matthew Klam is a terrific summer read – a cartoonist at an ocean-side artists’ conference ponders creativity, infidelity and his own existential purpose, and the results are hilarious and bracingly intelligent. A similarly artsy but more sober read is the essay collection How to Write an Autobiographical Novel (Mariner) by Alexander Chee. Chee’s insights about writing, love and activism are hard-won, honest and incredibly wise. I can’t wait to get my hands on the new novel When Katie Met Cassidy (Piatkus) by Camille Perri. I’ve heard it’s sexy, entertaining and subversive, and doesn’t that sound like a magnificent combination? I plan to read it while visiting my sister in Providence, Rhode Island.This summer I’m fulfilling a long-held ambition to explore the mountains and cities of the Republic of Georgia by their marshrutka countrywide minibus network. On a trip that is mainly travel, I want books that will inspire me, that are humane and thought-provoking. After reading the first outstanding story, I’ve been impatiently hoarding Glen James Brown’s debut, Ironopolis (Parthian), a series of interconnected tales set on a dilapidated Middlesbrough council estate. Likewise, Mary O’Hara’s Austerity Bites (Policy Press), which reports on the frontline of austerity cuts, a book sadly as relevant today as when it was first published four years ago. The Wilderness (WW Norton) by Sandra Lim is a knife blade fashioned into a magnifying glass. Oscillating between bold declarations and restrained, seething fury, the poems slowly build to a storm in the psyche. The book is a masterclass in line-making and metaphor. It lifts me, like the best books, higher into myself. “When I come to the right place, I believe I’ll paint a door on it and  walk right through.” I’ve also been struck by Scott McClanahan’s The Sarah Book (Tyrant). It is the epitome of autofiction – and advances the tradition to include images and photographs. But more than that, it is the first book I’ve read in a while that faithfully enacts Kafka’s truism that a book must be an axe that shatters the frozen seas inside us. Brutal and unforgiving, it explores a crumbling marriage and its ensuing existential crisis through the lens of the West Virginian working class. A classic of urgent, American storytelling.Sally Rooney’s award-winning novel, Conversations With Friends (Faber), is one of the best debuts I’ve encountered. It’s a witty and entrancing read, perfect for a summer’s day spent doing nothing else. I’m hoping to visit friends in the Hudson Valley this summer I first need to finish editing my film Mary Queen of Scots – which is based on John Guy’s biography of Mary Stuart, My Heart Is My Own (Harper). For my summer reading I will e into Stephen Greenblatt’s new book, Tyrant: Shakespeare on Politics (WW Norton). I love his mission to invigorate settled ideas, and it’s good preparation for the next play I’m directing, Measure for Measure at the Donmar, London.I have enjoyed The Incurable Romantic (Little, Brown), in which psychotherapist Frank Tallis opens his casebook. There have been quite a few such books recently, most of them overpraised and not as well written as their admirers claim. But Tallis writes with clarity and wit about the morbid condition of love, which emerges here as a kind of mental disorder. I have some misgivings about patient confidentiality and exaggeration andor light fictionalisation in places (Tallis has form as a horror novelist), but this is undoubtedly riveting stuff.I’ve just put down The Kiss Quotient (Atlantic) by Helen Hoang and I loved it so much I want to hand it out to strangers on the street. It’s a beautiful love story and a peek inside the life and heart of a woman who has Asperger’s or high-functioning autism. I was mesmerised by this book, which manages to be steamy hot and sweet at the same time. An American Marriage (Algonquin) by Tayari Jones is another incredible love story, though fraught with greater challenges for the couple at the centre, which makes the story all the more moving. Jones’s prose is chock-full of lyricism, grace and wisdom. You will never forget the story of Celestial and Roy. Unfortunately, there are no grand travel plans for me this season. My summer “holiday” will be stolen moments in my favourite reading chair.I read The One Who Wrote Destiny (Atlantic) by Nikesh Shukla, a beautiful, brilliant modern classic, cover to cover on one long-haul flight – take tissues! And Mr Loverman (Hamish Hamilton) by Bernadine Evaristo is the funniest book I’ve read this year, but also one of the saddest. Every character makes a perfect holiday companion. My summer travels are all work-related this year – Wales, Suffolk, Edinburgh and Cairo – so to see me through the trains, planes and buses, I’ll be packing When I Hit You (Atlantic) by Meena Kandasamy, Grime Kids (Orion) by DJ Target, Elsewhere, Home (Telegram) by Leila Aboulela and Things Bright and Beautiful (Penguin) by Anbara Salam.Sara Baume’s A Line Made By Walking (Windmill), about Frankie, who retreats from urban life and connects with nature, really made an impression on me this year. A fun and breezy read was Charlotte Bingham’s memoir MI5 and Me: A Coronet Among the Spooks (Bloomsbury), an account of her discovery that her father was a spy and of her own “inactive” service. Go Went Gone (Granta) by Jenny Erpenbeck, looking at the plight of asylum seekers as told through a retired university professor, I found very moving. My dream holiday reads include The Overstory (William Heinemann) by Richard Powers, an eco epic, with trees at the heart of the storytelling, and Ling Ma’s Severance (Macmillan), a brilliant-sounding post-apocalyptic novel, centring on the end times of late capitalism. I’ve been learning to swim this year, and while I’m in Paxos practising my strokes, I’ve accumulated some books with swimmers on the covers, and top of the pile to read is Turning: Lessons from Swimming Berlin’s Lakes (Virago) by Jessica J Lee. I recommend Territory of Light (Penguin), Yuko Tsushima’s stories of marital disappointment, parenthood and loneliness following a separation in 70s Tokyo. It’s unflinching and brings to mind Elena Ferrante’s early work. Caryl Phillips’ novel A View of the Empire at Sunset (Vintage), about the becoming of Jean Rhys, fully inhabits the despair of damp prewar London and stifling colonial society abroad. Edouard Louis’s History of Violence (Harvill Secker), detailing a sexual attack and its aftermath, is shocking, but also tender in its examination of class difference and queer desire. Books I’m packing for Arles include Annie Ernaux’s The Years (Publishers Group), Will Ashon’s forthcoming Wu-Tang epic, Chamber Music (Granta) and Nikesh Shukla’s The One Who Wrote Destiny (Atlantic).I’ve been travelling over the last month and I’ve been bouncing back and forth between books during my travels. The first is called Iron Ambition: My Life With Cus D’Amato (Sphere) by Mike Tyson and Larry Sloman. I’m a fan of Cus D’Amato, who also trained world champions Floyd Patterson and José Torres. I’m also reading Nietzsche for the first time, partly because Cus had Mike reading Nietzsche at 15 years old. I’m halfway through Thus Spake Zarathustra (Wordsworth) and will admit I can’t make head or tail of some of it. I think the book is telling me to believe in myself, to think at a higher-than-average level, and to not get bogged down with petty things. Ideal holiday reading.Anybody who wants a real treat must read Martina Evans’s Now We Can Talk Openly About Men (Carcanet). Full of insight and humour, it tells the story of two women’s lives in Ireland during the civil war. As a poet, Evans’s ability to choose just the right word is unerring. I also highly recommend Maggie O’Farrell’s I Am, I Am, I Am (Tinder), a memoir that rivals the beauty of her novels. My own summer holiday will be spent in Sweden doing research for a book. While there, I plan to reread some old favourites – starting with Tom Wolfe’s The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (Vintage).Rachel Cusk’s Kudos (Faber) is one of the most astoundingly original and necessary books I’ve ever read. It made me laugh, think and cry. She’s my friend, but I recommend it without apology: I envy anyone who hasn’t read it yet. I was startled, but also very moved, by the almost abrasive directness of Rose Tremain’s memoir Rosie (Chatto \u0026amp Windus). It did exactly what memoirs ought to do: made me want to rush straight back to her fiction. My ideal holiday (a bit of a fantasy at the moment) would therefore be a fortnight in Rome with all of Tremain on a Kindle, along with John Updike’s Rabbit (Penguin) quartet – which people have been ordering me to read for years – as well as Motherhood (Harvill Secker) by Sheila Heti, which I’ve been hoarding, and Never Anyone But You (Corsair) by the unfailingly brilliant Rupert Thomson.I know it sounds a little sad, but I tend to get really excited when I receive the Polity Press’s new catalogue. They publish so much clever, challenging and fascinating stuff. Over the summer I plan to read Alain Corbin’s A History of Silence (Polity). Corbin writes sparely, beautifully and with an exquisite fastidiousness about, well… something and nothing: quiet. In the first chapter he recommends George Rodenbach’s The Bells of Bruges (Dedalus) and Max Picard’s The Flight from God (St Augustine’s Press). I intend to consume all three of the above, at home or on trains, in an atmosphere of gentle reverence.Luis Alberto Urrea’s The House of Broken Angels (Little, Brown) is a great American novel, if we understand “America” to be all of the Americas, including Mexico. It’s profane, funny and moving. Sayaka Murata’s Convenience Store Woman (Portobello) takes a universal space, the convenience store, and turns it into the setting for a darkly comic (and very short) novel about alienation and identity in an urban, capitalist society. Alexander Chee’s How to Write an Autobiographical Novel (Mariner) is a collection of essays about race, writing, politics, queerness and sexuality that is urgent and insightful. I’ll be in Paris for much of the summer, and I’ll be taking Édouard Louis’ The End of Eddy (Vintage), Leila Slimani’s Lullaby (Faber), Han Kang’s The Vegetarian (Portobello), Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko (Head of Zeus), Lisa Ko’s The Leavers (Dialogue) and Jenny Zhang’s Sour Heart (Bloomsbury).This year, I’m packing José Saramago’s novels - I’ve only just got round to him, and I’m knocked out by the worldly precision and the combination of substance and grandeur. The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis (Vintage) was a revelation, and I’m looking forward to the half dozen more now in a pile. The two new novels I really want to take away are both by favourite Australian authors: Michelle de Kretser’s The Life to Come (Allen \u0026amp Unwin) and Tim Winton’s The Shepherd’s Hut (Picador). They’re both writers of wonderful freshness and energy. Just right for two weeks’ retreat at an Austrian health farm, to fit in between forest walks, massages, advanced treatments and 650 exquisitely tantalising calories a day.One of my favourite books this year was Nine Island (Catapult) by Jane Alison, which is funny and wise and such a closely observed account of a single woman’s life during her time living in Florida. It’s so vividly described that I didn’t read it as fiction, which shows how good a writer Alison is. Her protagonist J’s reflections on sex, love and other people are so unapologetic and honest, I felt less alone and freakish while reading the book. Another that had me in its grip, due to her insightful and direct voice, was Kudos (Faber) by Rachel Cusk. Cusk has a piercing intellect but demonstrates it through perspicacity, not by showing off on the page. I came to the graphic memoir Persepolis (Pantheon) by Marjane Satrapi via my 19-year-old daughter. It is set in Iran around the Islamic revolution when the author is 10. We accompany her through her gradual awakening to politics, love, oppression and the complexity of families – and her drawings are enchanting. I am going to Hastings, East Sussex, for a week’s course at the art school. The books I’ll take with me are Motherhood (Harvill Secker) by Sheila Heti, and Zadie Smith’s new collection of essays, Feel Free (Hamish Hamilton).Ponti (Picador) by Sharlene Teo is a sultry, hilarious dissection of mother-daughter relationships, and the effect of time and teenagehood on friendships, against the backdrop of Singapore B-movies. It oozes confidence. On Michael Jackson (Granta) is Margo Jefferson’s excellent, empathic take on the singer, encapsulating the pressures of being a child star, the most famous person on the planet and having a complicated legacy that can sometimes make people forget about the music. Meanwhile, Crudo (Picador) by Olivia Laing is a hot and heavy look at post-Brexit Britain through the eyes of newlywed Kathy as she summers in Italy. It’s Olivia Laing’s fiction debut and is very much a self-assured interrogation of the times we live in. James Smythe’s I Still Dream (Borough) is his most accomplished work – a past, present and future of AI, which is as human as it is otherworldly, and utterly engrossing. I am going to east Devon and will be taking the short story collection Heads of the Colored People (Chatto \u0026amp Windus) by Nafissa Thompson-Spires, the memoir This Really Isn’t About You (Picador) by Jean Hannah Edelstein and Londoners (Granta) by Craig Taylor.Don Paterson’s wonderfully learned The Poem: Lyric, Sign, Metre (Faber) is pure joy for footnote freaks and those who like to get high thinking about thinking. Not so much about how to be a poet as how to be in a poem, or even be a poem, it also works as a great book about music. DG Compton’s The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe (Gateway), written in 1974, coolly anticipated society being occupied with reality TV, and continues its journey from depicting an imaginary world to approaching nonfiction. I’ll be in Lisbon, switching between Shirley Collins’s All in the Downs (Strange Attractor) and Lamont Hawkins’s Raw: My Journey Into the Wu-Tang Clan (Faber), to see what they have in common. I’ll also be taking a handful of those nourishing one-pound Penguin Modern classics so I can go on holiday with George Orwell’s Notes on Nationalism, Albert Camus’s Create Dangerously, James Baldwin’s Dark Days, Kathy Acker’s New York City in 1979 and Samuel Beckett’s The End.This summer I’m going to Krakow for a residency and I’m taking The Idiot (Vintage) by Elif Batuman, a brain-meltingly funny Bildungsroman about communication breakdowns in the dawn of the internet era. I’ve already read it twice, but can’t bear to be without it. I’ll also be taking See What Can Be Done (Faber) by Lorrie Moore, my favourite short-story writer’s collected nonfiction, and The New Animals (Victoria University Press) by Pip Adam, the breakthrough New Zealand novel of 2017, which is about the generational ide, the fashion industry – and I can’t say more or I’ll ruin the ending. It’s ambitious, compulsive and strange as all hell.I’m going to New York and Lisbon this summer and I’m going to reread Maya Angelou’s The Heart of a Woman (Virago). I like these simple stories of people’s lives and experiences. The book gives you an insight into the intelligent, passionate woman that Angelou undoubtedly is. I will also take Edith Jackson (Puffin) by Rosa Guy. I have a really old library copy. It’s a story documenting the life of one girl in America with more than her share of life’s challenges. Nicole Dennis-Benn’s Here Comes the Sun (Oneworld) was the first Jamaica-set book I read. As a Jamaican woman, that was really exciting. It follows three women: two sisters and their mum. The older sister is navigating sexuality and being a queer woman, the younger is battling identity, being a darker-skinned girl, bleaching. It’s really addictive.I’m heading to Savoie in the French Alps. I’m taking South Atlantic Requiem (Arcadia) by Edward Wilson, one of my favourite spy novelists, and I Hid My Voice (Abacus) by Parinoush Saniee, an Iranian novelist, which is about a patriarchal family that is symbolic of the Iranian regime. I’m rereading George F Kennan’s Realities of American Foreign Policy (WW Norton). Written in 1954, it feels relevant again, given what’s happening now between the US and Russia. I’d also recommend Princess Bari (Periscope) by South Korean author Hwang Sok-yong and Thinner Than Skin (Jacaranda) by Uzma Aslam Khan, a Pakistani-American novelist. Both are wonderful in so many ways.I’m just back from the inspirational Worlds festival at the National Centre for Writing, Norwich. I came away laden with books and have already finished three of them. The Swan Book (Constable) by Alexis Wright is a devastating dystopian vision of a future Australia. I thought Behold, America (Bloomsbury) by Sarah Churchwell both brilliant and painfully timely, while Panashe Chigumadzi’s These Bones Will Rise Again (Indigo) is an extraordinary and thrilling history of Zimbabwe, culminating in the overthrow of Robert Mugabe. If you holiday anywhere near water, do take along the newly reissued edition of Charles Sprawson’s classic Haunts of the Black Masseur (Vintage). I’ll be rereading it between swims in Hydra in Greece.Peter Carey’s A Long Way from Home (Faber), Ian Brown’s The Boy in the Moon and Zadie Smith’s essays Feel Free (Hamish Hamilton) would all make perfect holiday reading. Meanwhile, my own stack of summer books include The Unaccompanied (Faber) by Simon Armitage, Untitled (Mainstream) by Carol Ann Duffy, The Bonniest Companie (Picador) by Kathleen Jamie, Jackself (Picador) by Jacob Polley and Don’t Call Us Dead (Chatto \u0026amp Windus) by Danez Smith. I’ll be carrying these gorgeous volumes back and forth between my New York City apartment and my old farmhouse upstate.Anyone who has the slightest interest in politics has to read Tim Shipman’s Fallout (William Collins), the follow-up to his thrilling referendum account, All Out War. Holidays may be about escapism, but this fly-on-the-wall unravelling of the 2017 election is car-crash exhilarating. For a made-up thriller, though, I enjoyed returning to the world of George Smiley in John Le Carré’s A Legacy of Spies (Penguin) in an age when the global distrust of the cold war feels unnervingly prescient. I’ve also been deeply moved and inspired by Didier Eribon’s Returning to Reims (Allen Lane), having missed the stage adaptation at the Manchester international festival last year. It’s an autobiographical account of the young gay author’s journey back to his working-class, industrial French town.The stories in Neel Patel’s If You See Me, Don’t Say Hi (Flatiron) are perfect bitesize morsels for the beach, travel legs or quiet moments. Mackenzi Lee’s Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue (Harper Collins)is a giddy whirlwind romp of a love story I can’t wait for the forthcoming sequel. Rebecca Solnit’s Hope in the Dark (Canongate) is an argument for continuing to take action, even when everything feels uncertain, and will send you back home from holiday ready to carry on. I’m going to London with my family, and bringing Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Between the World and Me (Text), Justina Ireland’s Dread Nation (Balzer \u0026amp Bray) – zombies plus the American civil war plus a fierce female fighter – and an advance copy of Edward Carey’s forthcoming Little (Aardvark Bureau), about the girl who grows up to become Madame Tussaud.I’d recommend the recently republished Faces in the Water (Virago) by Janet Frame. She’s a true original, her work is a joy to return to, and it never ages. Kintu by Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi (Oneworld) is a great, big, roaring Ugandan epic that follows the trials and tribulations of the Kintu clan from the 1750s to today. I’m taking poetry, too: it travels light and packs a punch. I’ll include Us (Faber) by Zaffar Kunial, a poet whose work thrills me, who makes you return to the origins of things, places, language and people again and again. He’s a poet who takes traditions seriously but makes of them something entirely new – a must. I’m taking Gerda Stevenson’s fabulous Quines (Luath) – the old Aberdonian word for women – which takes us through a vivid, moving history of outstanding Scottish women in poetry. It’s a groundbreaker of a book, rich and resonant, strong of voice. I’m going to go back to Eigg, an inspiring island run by its own people, and I’ll daytrip to Muck and Canna just cos I canny not.My first recommendation is The Wood: The Life and Times of Cockshutt Wood (Doubleday) by John Lewis Stempel. It is a glorious evocation of the rhythm and dynamism of an English woodland, connecting us to a much longer timeframe: a needed balance to the working, urban lives most of us have. My second is Audre Lorde’s Your Silence Will Not Protect You (Silver), the collected essays of this important poet, writer and intersectional feminist. It is a book of our times, not least because it reminds us that current issues of gender, race and power have been being contested, here in incandescent and penetrating prose and poetry, since the 1960s.I will be spending my summer break being very quiet indeed in the Kent countryside. I shall take a pile of books including Stuart Hall’s Familiar Stranger: A Life Between Two Islands (Penguin), the posthumous memoir by this vital cultural theorist Colm Tóibín’s The House of Names (Viking) Nan Shepherd’s The Living Mountain (Canongate) and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus (Fourth Estate). I’ll also be remembering Manchester, my home until last year, with Dave Haslam’s wonderful biography, Sonic Youth Slept on My Floor (Constable), and rereading Ursula Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness (Gollancz) and Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale (Vintage), to feel again their potent, timely power.The Stopping Places: A Journey Through Gypsy Britain (Chatto \u0026amp Windus) by Damian Le Bas is the perfect accompaniment to any holiday in the British Isles. It maps a secret world, and made me want to live outdoors, at least for a summer. I’m going to Folegandros in August, and I plan to take Lara Pawson’s jagged, stunning meditation on war, violence and love, This Is the Place to Be (CB Editions). I’ve read it once and it was like drinking lightning I can’t wait to rip through it again. This summer I’m staying home so I’ll be reading around current erratic obsessions, mostly translated fiction and Trump. The recently published Call Me Zebra by Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi sounds mad and tricksy. Moroccan writer and film-maker Ahmed Bouanani’s The Hospital, a short hallucinatory novel is appearing for the first time in English translation by Lara Vergnaud. Also, Mistaken Identity by Asad Haider, which deals with class and race post-Trump, and I’ve been eagerly awaiting new translations of Brazilian writer Machado de Assis. A new complete collection will be published later this month translated by Margaret Jull Costa and Robin Patterson.What books are you reading this summer?

But the scale of Ryanair’s operations also means that quite a significant number of people could be affected,” he said.One concern for Ryanair is that any cancellation comes with the memory of last winter’s travails still relatively fresh. Thousands of passengers had their flights cancelled due to a blunder in the airline’s staffing roster.“Their brand is built on being reliable bastards,” said Dan Gavshon Brady, a strategist at brand consultancy Wolff Olins. “What the strikes threaten to do is question the reliability. They’re more resilient than others because they’ve never promised anything more than no-frills but deliver on what they promise.“But that also leaves them less margin for error, so when you get problems it threatens to affect your brand.”At one stage last year, it looked as if Ryanair might avert any escalation of tension with its labour force. In a reversal of the airline’s decades-old policy, O’Leary agreed to recognise trade unions, something he has once claimed would be less preferable than cutting off his own hands. It seemed like a watershed moment, albeit one forced by the airline’s staffing bungle.The mistake had left Ryanair desperately short of experienced pilots, giving them the whip hand over a management team keen to limit flight cancellations.O’Leary’s subsequent damascene conversion into a reluctant trade unionist was reminiscent of his 2013 vow to start being nicer to passengers – one made by necessity, through gritted teeth.A little more than six months later and unions representing both pilots and crew say recognitionhas not developed into engagement with their grievances.This time, while pilots in Ireland remain dissatisfied and plan to strike on 12 July, it is cabin crew who are most aggrieved.They have long complained of poor pay and working conditions and meagre employment rights as a result of Ryanair’s model of employing them via third-party agencies.As the  revealed last year, they are also subjected to disciplinary proceedings and public shaming if they do not hit sales targets designed to help Ryanair flog more scratchcards and perfume.Multiple crew unions, assisted by the the International Transport Workers’ Federation, have delivered a list of 34 demands to the company.The implication is that more strikes will follow unless the company comes to the negotiating table. “The onus is now on Ryanair,” said ITF general secretary Stephen Cotton.“Ensure that workers get the treatment they deserve, or more national unions may decide that strikes are the only way to make the company listen.“Ryanair has started to change, but we believe the culture at the top needs to change too in order to deliver on the promises it has made. “The close-knit corporate governance model that has been a feature of the company thus far is no longer appropriate for a major airline. An increase in independent representation on the board would give us greater confidence that Ryanair is serious about a new approach.” But Ryanair’s rapid growth and financial success remain core strengths and not everybody is convinced it will see the need to change.Chris Tarry, founder of aviation consultancy Ctaira, said: “Whilst this changes the rules of engagement at Ryanair the fact is that it starts from a position of the lowest costs and is consistently the most profitable airline.“There are different dynamics and flexing of muscles by labour but it’s all clearly manageable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0771d1c08c6403e78f161d4e3e722979f9b6c3ac/9_94_3471_2082/master/3471.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a339984ec81c88c0952a3bcc895c2626","title":"carney should heed employment experts before rate decision","story":"Bank of England – set for August rise – has been consistently wrong about labour marketThe message from the Bank of England has been clear: get ready for an August increase in interest rates. Modestly higher official borrowing costs are needed to prevent the economy from overheating.This, of course, is exactly what Threadneedle Street was saying three months ago. Back then it had convinced the City that a May rate increase was pretty much a done deal but then got cold feet as weak economic data from the first three months of 2018 poured in.The U-turn damaged the Bank’s credibility, which explains why the recent hawkish noises emerging from Mark Carney and some of the other eight members of the monetary policy committee have been largely ignored by the markets.The argument for a rate rise goes like this. For almost a decade the Bank has been providing colossal stimulus to the economy. Interest rates have never been lower and the boost from cheap borrowing has been supplemented by quantitative easing (increasing the money supply by any other name).This was needed because the deep recession of a decade meant there was oodles of unused capacity in the economy that would not have been put to work without the monetary stimulus. But that spare capacity has pretty much been used up and, as a result, there is a risk that inflation will start to rise unless policy is tightened.However, the Bank also said it expected inflationary pressures to build in the labour market because the lowest unemployment rate for more than four decades would force employers to pay more in order to recruit and retain workers. Here the Bank is on shakier ground.Central banks, including the Bank of England, base their judgment that inflationary pressure is building in the labour market on the relationship between earnings and unemployment first developed in the 1950s by Bill Phillips. The traditional Phillips curve showed that as unemployment came down, workers found it easier to negotiate higher pay deals. When joblessness went up, workers reined in their demands. Unemployment is at its lowest since 1975, so earnings growth should be picking up. If it isn’t there can only be two realistic explanations: the inflationary surge will eventually happen and has simply been delayed or there is more slack in the labour market than the headline unemployment rate would suggest.In addition, the pair say that workers are frightened in a way they weren’t before the Great Recession and have less bargaining power than they once did. The Bank is gearing up to raise interest rates because it thinks unemployment is poised to fall below the level at which it will start to generate inflationary pressure (usually called the natural rate or the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment). However, Blanchflower and Bell assert that the natural rate or the NAIRU is actually a lot lower than the Bank believes.Employment rates and participation rates can rise, and unemployment rates can fall and by a lot. Globalisation has weakened workers’ bargaining power. Migrant flows may have put downward pressure on wages and greased the wheels of the labour market as their presence increased mobility. The decline in the home ownership, which slows job creation and increases unemployment, has helped mobility and lowered the natural rate.”Of course, it is possible that the hawks on the MPC are right and that Blanchflower and Bell are wrong. Sooner or later, wage inflation will inevitably pick up if unemployment continues to fall. But it is worth saying that the Bank has been consistently wrong about the labour market while Blanchflower and Bell have been consistently right. Carney needs to be careful not to go down in history as central banking’s version of the boy who cried wolf."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b80e8c9b94e5538e33feb962a426b0796fe956d/0_0_5361_3217/master/5361.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=869199401c126abf8863c949435210fe","title":"observer view on worldwide scarcity means we should conserve water","story":"It’s hot. Very hot. And as ever in the UK when the sun comes out for more than a few, fleeting summer afternoons, there is talk of water shortages, rationing and hosepipe bans. It is a pity the millionaire bosses of privatised water companies do not spend more time lining leaking pipes and less time lining their pockets. Yet despite this and other controversies over charges, metering, mismanagement of upland catchment areas and periodic downstream flooding, Britain’s water politics are relatively benign.Not so in many other parts of a densely populated world, where the availability of clean, potable water, and water for agricultural and industrial use is a hot political, security and economic issue – as well as a frequently unmet, basic human need. Ethiopia’s stupendous $4bn (£3bn) Grand Renaissance dam on the Blue Nile is a case in point. When completed, it will be the largest dam in Africa, generating more than three times the energy produced by the Hoover dam in the US. But for some, it is a cause for war.The sense of vulnerability arising from foreign control of a vital national resource is undoubtedly acute. It is a sensation the desiccated military dictatorship of Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, is not managing well. Yet Egypt is not alone in its insecurities. Similar anxieties can be observed across the Middle East, where growing competition for increasingly scarce water resources further complicates already complex political, religious and social conflicts.Control of water supplies emanating, for example, from the Tigris and Euphrates, flowing south from Turkey, is a key element in the political control of towns and countryside in Iraq and Syria. When creating its doomed caliphate, Islamic State supposedly “weaponised” water. Both countries are currently suffering shortages due to human activity (including new dams in Turkey), changing weather patterns and desertification. Some argue that control of water can be strategically decisive – a thesis Moses would presumably support.A government that cannot provide plentiful water, and thus ensure basic hygiene, healthcare and sanitation, may not long survive. It’s a lesson reiterated last week in Khorramshahr, in south-west Iran, where anger over lack of clean drinking water morphed into violent anti-regime protests. Conversely, it is surely no coincidence that the African and Asian countries where supplies are least reliable are also among the most unstable, poorest and most conflicted. Millions of children die each year from avoidable causes, including polluted water. According to the WaterAid charity, one in nine people still live without clean water close to home.Global warming and population growth are further roiling water politics. In drought-hit southern Australia, a row erupted over the alleged “politicising” of the problem by those who argued climate change was to blame. Even when, for the first time, pregnant cows were sent to the abattoir because pastureland had turned to dust, sheer obtuseness trumped common sense Down Under.Climate change denial cannot be vanquished overnight, no more than we can insist it start raining. But appreciating the value of water, and water conservation, can start today. So if you are asked to turn off the garden hosepipe or leave the toilet unflushed, don’t hesitate. It may not count for much in the big picture but, hot or not, it’s the least we should do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5ebc4cf5b705f75613488abbc632673dcd9b6bf/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=257723e2d947c903cb1d0c45bd786fa9","title":"denver on tap are these the best brews in the us","story":"Artisan ale lovers, hop to it: with dozens upon dozens of top breweries and an annual beer fest to boot, Denver’s craft beer scene is the toast of the country. Aaron Millar lists his favourite watering holesDenver is known as the “Napa Valley of Beer” for good reason: more hoppy delights are brewed here than anywhere else in the country. Add to that five gold medals at this year’s World Beer Cup Awards (or the Olympics of brewing, as it’s known), more than 100 artisan tap rooms, and the simple fact that beer tastes better looking at the mountains, having climbed mountains or talking about going to the mountains tomorrow. Like a brew with a view? Here are some of Denver’s top hop spots: Tivoli Brewing Company Denver’s oldest brewery has been serving up frothy refreshments since the first settlers arrived in 1859. Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city. Their Dear You French saison is already a classic beer.Denver Beer Trail With four walking routes – each through a different downtown neighbourhood – covering 14 miles and 35 taprooms in total, this is the ultimate craft-brew pub crawl, a half-marathon of beer. Great American Beer Festival Held in Denver each October, this is the largest beer party in the country, with more than 3,500 artisan, classic and rare brews on show. Want a sip of each? Well, good luck: a 1oz sample of every brew on display adds up to 220 pints, or about three bathtubs’ of beer.Telluride Blues \u0026amp Brews The best blues musicians on the planet alongside the best craft beer in the state, all served up in one of the Rockies’ most beautiful towns. It’s every Coloradan’s favourite end-of-summer brews event, and with good reason.If you prefer your glass with a stem, then here’s something to celebrate: with 300 days of sunshine a year, low humidity, and crisp mountain nights, Colorado is overflowing with wine as well as beer. From rieslings and cabernets to wines made from peach, cherries, honey and plums, its high-altitude vineyards – the loftiest in the US – produce a unique regional style.For the best wineries and tours, head over to the Western Slope. Two Rivers Winery – found near the spectacular red rock canyons of the Colorado National Monument – and the award-winning vintages of Carlson Vineyards are two of the best.United Airlines offers a seasonal, non-stop service from London Heathrow to Denver on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner – complete with high-tech cabin lighting and smoother ride technology, plus flat-bed seats in Polaris business class.

So what will men make of his footwear now that he is turning his attention to them?It’s the end of our hour together, and Manolo Blahnik is walking me out, through the grand hallway of his offices in a Georgian townhouse, when a rare silence falls over him. He is watching a courier deliver a parcel. The man has braids that are tightly bound into a green bandana that matches his uniform, and he hands over the little signy machine to an assistant with a jaunty half-bow. Blahnik is transfixed. As the door closes behind him, Blahnik allows himself a small gasp of delight, his eyes wide behind tiny tortoiseshell glasses. “Style!” he squeaks. “Everywhere!”Admiring men’s style is a new hobby for Mr Blahnik, now 75 and so established as a women’s designer that, like Madonna (who once said, “His shoes are as good as sex and they last longer”), his heels are famous enough to go by a single name: “Manolos”. “If God had wanted women to wear flat shoes,” wrote Alexandra Shulman in 1994, “he wouldn’t have invented Manolo Blahnik.” After 45 years of making women’s shoes he is opening his first men’s shop, where he will attempt to do for them what he has done for women – create fancy, fun, luxury footwear that is also remarkably comfortable. “His men’s shoes, well…” said his friend Rupert Everett, “they’re like slightly more feminine versions of the women’s shoes.”While other designers have followed fashion through vertiginous platforms and clompy soles, Manolo Blahnik’s have remained staunchly trendless – typically a modest stiletto, a patent leather Mary Jane, a bright colour, reminiscent of sweeties. And yet, fashion has come to him, whether radical design collective Vetements or young British designer Grace Wales Bonner, who has, he says, “An incredible uniqueness – immediately we got on well.” He smiles, his accent a chocolatey combination of the six languages he speaks fluently. “When I worked at the Royal College I used to end up with the freakiest of them all, the most twisted of them all.” Which, I offer, is slightly surprising considering, and I’m going to say, “you are such a part of the establishment”, or “considering your shoes cost £800”, but he finishes my sentence: “Because I’m such an old old boy, yes!”Some of his favourite customers, he adds, are those who travel for miles, leaving home at dawn to stand in line for his legendary annual sample sale. “We have queues and queues of young women who could be my great granddaughters. Four o’clock on the first train from, I don’t know where, from Wales or something. I love those women.”And they love him, too – they stop him in the street, desperate for selfies with this eccentric OAP who designs 600 shoes a year. “Werk, werk, werk,” he exclaims, then checks, “Like Rihanna?” with whom he collaborated on three collections of sandals and thigh-high boots. He always says yes to photos and autographs, slightly bemused, despite having become a household name through Sex and the City. “You can take my Fendi Baguette,” Carrie Bradshaw told a Manhattan mugger. “You can take my ring and my watch. But please don’t take my Manolo Blahniks.”He does not sleep well. There is an infectious energy that rises from him like heat. He gets migraines that make him, he whispers, dramatically, “vomit”. Night is when he works best. “In fact, by the bed I have a little box with papers and a huge wire with a pen and when I can’t sleep I write. But my dreams are not very funny, they really are not. For instance I went to see Snow White – for weeks I couldn’t sleep.” He has recurring nightmares about she-wolves from Mexican novels, strangling him with sharp fingernails. It takes him some time, upon waking, to recover. “They’re reality for me, which is horrible. And you know, I have this incredible thing about death.” His friend Anna Piaggi, the Italian style icon, used to call him every morning as they got dressed, and the other day, when the phone rang he picked it up and began to chat to her, forgetting she died in 2012. “Señor Blahnik?” said the stranger on the other end of the line. He had to sit down for a moment.There are many Annas in his life, including Wintour, who only wears Manolos, and who remembers bouncing her child on her knee in his Chelsea store in the 1970s. He had moved to the UK from the Canary Islands – that was the period he was working with Ossie Clark, and became the first man on the cover of Vogue. “I love Mrs Wintour,” he says today. “She seems cold and aloof and distant, but she’s not. She’s so ine. And Grace Coddington, though all those girls are just getting a little bit… tired.” Elsewhere, in the recent film of his life, Manolo: The Boy Who Made Shoes for Lizards, Iman, John Galliano, Naomi Campbell and his great friend Mary Beard describe his artistry, the way he weaves his vast historical knowledge into his work.As well as Dickens and Flaubert, he is “obsessed” with films – the only benefit of the internet, he says, is the way it allows him to track down lost movies. Last weekend, a rare free day at home in Bath, he treated himself to an Angela Lansbury marathon, from Gaslight to Sweeney Todd. Gaslight, I mention, is being revisited today, as its story – a husband convincing his wife she is mad – has inspired a term that’s used regularly in political commentary. “Agh, everything’s political now which I find is very, very infuriating. I don’t care about politics. I don’t give a damn about those people, they’re so ugly, all of them. If they were ravishing, it would perhaps be different for me. I like physical beauty that you cannot reach, you know?”So he does think about politics? “No I don’t. I have likes and dislikes. Beauty is what’s important to me. I like statues also, that have nothing to say. Like the statues of Canova. Divine. I like things like that, that you cannot touch. The real thing is not exactly my…” He stops. He’s not interested in relationships. “I love living by myself. The idea of having to share something with anyone fills me with…” he shudders. “I mean… I don’t do well. Contact. I can’t stand – oh no – the normal functions of people. I’m very strange, actually, in that respect. Maybe I need help.” And he laughs.Has he ever had therapy? “No. I know exactly who I am and it doesn’t help you at all. Sometimes when I’m really desperate or crazy, because I have too much to do, I do my ‘mental cleaning’.” Which means returning to the authors he loves, Benito Pérez Galdós, Gore Vidal, Germaine Greer. “How wonderful she was in the 1970s, a woman with guts, saying: ‘This is what it is.’ And she’s incredible now. But now I think she’s not very healthy?” I start to reply and he talks over me. “But she is wonderful. Maybe you don’t like her. I like her. At the time it was shocking. It was too much, but it was true. Nowadays with all these stupid movements and this and that, it gets lost, her original thoughts about the freedom of a woman.”He finds peace in work. He is happiest in the factory. Elsewhere – meetings, especially – less so. “I’m not very pleasant sometimes,” he smiles, cheekily. “But I never think about me too much. When I do, I say: ‘Oh, what is going on? What is wrong? I should not do this.’ That’s why I say to you: ‘Doctors? No, thank you.’ I go to doctors a lot, but for the two crushed vertebra in my back. I have so many moods. I’m somebody who dreams a lot. I try to run away from this thing – what’s going on in the world has never been so bad as now.”His favourite people today are taxi drivers, because they talk to him. “I feel, not nostalgic, but melancholic about certain things that are gone. For instance, Bell \u0026amp Croyden used to be the most extraordinary Edwardian apothecary in London. Then I passed by the other day, and it’s like a huge empty supermarket in Dallas.

What else do you want to know? It’s coming home and that’s it,” said Dave, a 52-year-old Newcastle United fan, leaving the ground elated and already plotting how to get a semi-final ticket for Wednesday.It’s all about Moscow now. After a journey through Russia that has taken in five different cities, thousands of travel miles, and thousands of pounds in costs as well, the small band of England fans who have made it out to Russia will now have their eyes fixed on the country’s capital: Wednesday’s semi-final and next Sunday’s final will both be held at the Luzhniki stadium in southern Moscow, although a semi-final defeat would send England to St Petersburg for the third-placed match on Saturday.After the game, fans headed on to shuttle buses for the long drive back to the centre of Samara, a sprawling city with sandy beaches along the banks of the Volga in the central park, to soak up a last night of atmosphere in the Russian provinces.For some, it is now time to go back home. Jed Smith from Leicester has been to all the England games up to and including the quarter-final, but has now run out of both money and days off work and is flying home on Sunday.“To be honest, when I planned a trip up to the quarters, that seemed optimistic. I thought we’d get Germany or Brazil in the quarters and lose. Instead it’s our best chance since 1966 to win the whole thing. I’m gutted I’ll miss it.” For the semi-final, there is likely to be much higher demand than for Saturday’s game.Tom Blackwell, a Moscow-based England fan, had purchased two top-category tickets for the game in the days before for the face value of 22,000 roubles (£260) but due to the cost of flights ended up travelling alone, and sold the ticket for £75 shortly before the game to a local Russian.Many with the financial means to do so will now surely plan last-minute trips to Russia, as England have booked their first semi-final appearance since Italia 90. Russia has waived its visa regulations for the month for anyone in possession of a Fan ID, which can be obtained without a ticket, leading to the prospect of many fans travelling and hoping to pick up a ticket in Moscow.The tournament, which now enters its final week, has passed off in a spirit of good humour, and many of those fans who travelled are leaving with a more positive picture of Russia than the grey, humourless country they had imagined they would find.Smaller than usual numbers of European fans have travelled to the tournament, partly due to fears of hooliganism and the current political situation, although tens of thousands of fans from South and Central American countries made the trip, creating a carnival atmosphere across the stadium cities.Russian authorities were instructed to take a relaxed approach to visitors during the period, with police turning a blind eye to public drinking and other infringements of Russian laws that would usually be met with a firmer hand, and the tournament has proved a soft-power boon for the Russian government.On Friday, Vladimir Putin received retired football players, including former Manchester United stars Peter Schmeichel and Rio Ferdinand, in the Kremlin, together with the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino. The players presented the president with a “Putin” football jersey.“Many stereotypes about the country have been broken down. People see that. Russia is a hospitable country and friendly to those who come to us,” Putin told the footballers.The UK government announced a boycott of the World Cup after the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury earlier this year, and has so far refused to relent, particularly since two more people are now in hospital in the Wiltshire city having also been exposed to the nerve agent novichok."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ad4cf8c543c1c1211971374f1c3668f3de94ac/0_258_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1067c977a462ec67d5560f49ed6a932e","title":"england sweden world cup quarter final match report","story":"At the final whistle, the victorious players converged on one another. It took a few seconds for them to gather their breath and then, finally, they could join the party that was already\u0026nbspunder way behind the goal to their right. England had booked their place in a World Cup semi-final and\u0026nbspthis kind of euphoria has been so long coming – more than a quarter of a century since the last occasion – it was probably just inevitable they would soon be dancing on the pitch as well as in the stands.If we were to be picky, a legitimate argument could be made that England will need to play with more finesse if they are to harbour serious ambitions of winning this competition. They will have to pass the ball more efficiently and maybe, in possession, show a touch more arrogance, in the manner of a side that really believes they are the elite and this is where they belong. France, for example. Or Belgium.For now, however, Gareth Southgate and his players are fully entitled to cherish these moments bearing in mind the last time it happened Bobby Robson was manager and Spitting Image’s puppet of the England coach was a senile worrier called Rubbisho. Turin, 1990, with the penalties, Gazza’s tears and all that, is written into England’s history. This time, maybe there will be a happier ending. But the real glory will only be attainable in Moscow next Sunday and, on this evidence, they should not hold any fears about meeting Croatia in Wednesday’s semi-final.Why not be confident, after all, when England have now scored as many goals, 11, as Sir Alf Ramsey’s side in 1966? Eight of them, astonishingly, have come from set plays, the latest being the header from Harry Maguire to swing this game in England’s favour. Some might even argue they are too reliant on scoring this way. For that, show them the tape of Dele Alli’s goal or the other occasions when they threatened to add others.England played stodgily\u0026nbspat times, particularly in the first half, but it was a controlled performance overall and, importantly,\u0026nbspthe four players who would have missed the semi-final had they received another booking remained out of the referee’s notebook. Southgate’s team will be at full strength on Wednesday. Anything, as he says, is possible.At this point, as is becoming the norm, it is probably worth noting the now-familiar reminder from England’s manager that it is still not time to get too carried away. Not yet, anyway. Equally, Southgate also made the point that his team can play considerably better than they did for long spells of their latest victory. Early on it was disconcerting to see the way his team struggled, the way passes were misplaced and the suspicion, however briefly it passed, that the occasion had got to a couple of his\u0026nbspplayers.In their previous matches, England had been so quick to set the tempo, passing the ball incisively and making it clear very quickly that they would be happy to take the game to their opponents. That was not the case here. Ultimately, though, that sluggish start will quickly be forgotten and once they had taken the lead, half an hour in, there were only fleeting moments when England looked in any danger.Until that point, it had been a laboured performance. But then England won their first corner. No other player in the World Cup has won more aerial challenges than Maguire and it was strange, to say the least, that Sweden had designated Emil Forsberg to mark him. Maguire had a seven-inch advantage and made it count. It was a mismatch, the ball thudded off Maguire’s forehead, powered in to the right of the Swedish goalkeeper, Robin Olsen, and England had scored from a corner for the fourth time in this tournament.Sweden will reflect on the save that Jordan Pickford made from Marcus Berg’s header at the start of the second half and, though he was needed only sporadically, this was another splendid performance from England’s goalkeeper, showing again that he can handle the big\u0026nbspoccasion.Pickford pulled off another brilliant save at 2-0, when Viktor Claesson had the chance to change the complexion of the match. It was England’s first clean sheet of the tournament and there was never a concerted spell when Sweden – willing but limited\u0026nbspopponents – managed to pin them back.Instead, it might have been an even more straightforward victory if some of England’s better chances had fallen to Kane rather than Raheem Sterling. His first one-on-one with Olsen ended in a late offside flag, though the England player was not to know that. The second would have made it 2-0 at the interval and, though it was largely inconsequential in the end, this is the stage of the competition when Southgate desperately needs his front players to have ice in their veins. For all his many qualities, Sterling turns to slush too often and as long as that is case he will struggle to improve an England record that has now stretched to two goals from 42 appearances.No big deal, though. Sterling played his part, always looking to create mischief, and the way he stretches defences makes up in part for his erratic finishing. As for Kane, another goal from England’s leading scorer would have meant him\u0026nbspoutscoring Paolo Rossi when he won the Golden Boot in 1982, Gary\u0026nbspLineker when he did the same in 1986 and Totò Schillaci in 1990.As it was, Kane worked hard without getting many opportunities to add to his total and, strangely, that is one of the areas where England need to improve. Penalties and corners aside, Kane’s teammates are not creating enough chances for their principal\u0026nbspscorer.If that can be put right, England should be reasonably confident against anyone. For now, however, this is not a time to be too critical. Jordan Henderson had a fine match and England were largely untroubled once they had their second goal. For that one, Kieran Trippier’s pass gave Jesse Lingard the chance to clip the ball over from the right. Alli was at the far post to head the ball in and, half an hour later, the players in red were behind that goal, dancing in front of the England fans, daring to believe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca788fbeec4918bdd17bf934b3c02b4bdb13bbf9/0_161_2888_1733/master/2888.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b93f39f814f6d7b9171c6cd7dc7ee5c3","title":"russia world cup exit proud croatia penalties","story":"Before football comes home, it had to stop by the beach. Russia fans had one last chance on Sunday night to savour a squad that had already shattered all their expectations for this tournament. And they did it again in a bittersweet valedictory in Vladimir Putin’s dream city by the sea.All the best stories are comings-of-age, and Russia seemed to grow with each match, teaching a sceptical public that it was OK to believe again, that they wouldn’t suddenly embarrass them, that this time things would be different.It left pretty much everyone here asking the same question: where on earth did this side come from? Pressing a more gifted Croatia squad, belting in sublime curlers from 25 yards, nodding in equalisers in the 115th minute?“Guys! I am proud of you! I love you! Savour this moment!” yelled striker Artem Dzyuba in a fiery speech that mirrored a nation’s emotions just before Russia went out on penalty kicks.Long before that moment, high up in the stands, fans were starting to believe too.“Cheryshev hit that one like Ronaldo!” said Semyon, 23, who was still marvelling over the left winger’s wonder-strike as he grabbed snacks at half-time. “Oh my God, could you imagine he could do that?”“I think England must be worried about facing us,” said Anton Sashnikov, planning for the semi-final clash that ultimately wasn’t to be. “Our guys are playing with intensity, they really want to win. I don’t think that England will be able to keep up.”There is more in common between the England and Russia fan than either would like to admit, a complex that comes down to the simple belief that someone at some moment is going to lose his man or shank a penalty. Both have found redemption in this year’s World Cup.“And from there it’s just one more match and we are the champions,” Sashnikov said and he smiled, as though daring a reporter to tell him that wasn’t likely.Saturday’s match was the reason many people bother going to see football. If you looked up the Fifa rankings, there was no question who should have won. But ultimately it came down to a question of slight angles and dashes of momentum, and the tears that came after Russia’s heartbreaking loss were more about frustration than condemnation.“If Modric’s penalty had just gone a few centimetres further out,” one fan groaned as he went down the steps, listing off a series of other counterfactuals that could have given Russia the win.Not all fairytales have happy endings.Across Russia, fans packed bars, pubs and the World Cup fan zones to watch the team’s unlikely push to make the semi-final. In Samara, where earlier England had beaten Sweden to provide the opposition for the winners of Russia v Croatia, the vast fanzone was closed as it was full to capacity, and crowds spilled out of restaurants and bars with screens, desperate to catch a glimpse of the action.At Na Dne, a beer hall near the banks of the Volga, the inside was packed and sweaty, and a hundred-strong crowd jostled for position outside to see through the grimy windows, cheering on their team. After Cheryshev’s early goal, one man fell to the ground and screamed, “Stanislav, I’m sorry I doubted you,” referring to the widespread pre-tournament disdain for coach Stanislav Cherchesov. There were scenes of joy as the unexpected extra-time equaliser was scored, and groups of men tossed their beers in the air and screamed with excitement.But after Croatia prevailed on penalties, there was a shocked silence, and people began to file home, quietened and depressed.Outside the stadium in Sochi, there was something like a dialogue. “Smolov is a jackass!” yelled one teenager. “Hey, don’t curse our guys, they gave it their all tonight,” a middle-aged man with a ponytail said and continues on his way. “Igor Igor Akinfeev! Oh!” another man yells. “Igor, come here I’d like to have a word with you,” howled a woman, playing the disappointed wife, tottering down the street in heels. Her friends laughed tipsily.People have different ways of dealing with grief.For some, that involved a long walk along Sochi’s rocky shoreline, maybe with a bar of plombir ice cream or a midnight swim in the Black Sea. And for some, it involves sending your wife and two girls home to the hotel, and knocking back a few at a summertime cafe that sells grilled meats and the local unfiltered ale.Aleksandr, who declined to give a last name, had driven three days to Sochi in his Toyota Highlander from Khanty-Mansiysk, where he owns a security company, for a beach vacation with his family. He’d neglected until the last minute to tell his wife that he had also bought a ticket to Saturday’s match.“She wasn’t happy about that,” he admitted.But the match was worth it, he said, despite the cost of the ticket, the days spent behind the wheel and the marital strife it occurred.“I think this is as far as we were allowed to go,” he said, suggesting that all this is decided from above. “What would Russia be doing in a semi-finals at a World Cup? So I can understand why we lost. But you know I was just hoping that this time, maybe we’d slip through.”Additional reporting by Shaun Walker in Samara"},{"url":null,"title":"team bbc little bit of everything england big afternoon world cup","story":"“Three men in a studio, Gary Lineker pre-senting!” And so to the biggest day in English sports broadcasting for 12 years as our brave pundits gathered for an England appearance in a World Cup quarter-final. Lights, camera, action: football’s coming home. Apparently.English hearts fluttered and for all concerned reassurance could be taken from the fact the BBC were in charge of proceedings. No offence to ITV, and especially so after their fine handling of the last-16 victory over Colombia – This Is The One and all that – but on an afternoon when patriotic fervour was cranked up to 11, it felt right that the nation’s broadcaster should lead the way. It’s what the Queen would have wanted. More than that, it’s what Sir Bobby Charlton would have wanted, even if he was, somewhat oddly, sitting on Centre Court watching tennis.And it was the tennis which gave away to BBC One’s coverage from Russia. Come 2pm it was a case of goodbye Rafael Nadal and hello to the surprise sound of Danny “trotters” Dyer leading viewers into the opening sequence. And then there he was – Lineker head up, eyes trained, ready to deliver. And boy, did he deliver.“Good afternoon. Where’s Des Lynam when you need him? He always hit the spot, a bit like England.” A cracking opening line but what we’ve come to expect from the accomplished striker-turned-accomplished host. What was less expected, however, was the make-up of the men sat to Lineker’s right in the BBC’s airy Moscow base. Alan Shearer – check, Rio Ferdinand – check, Frank Lamp – hang on, that’s not Frank Lampard. That’s ... Jürgen Klinsmann.The BBC’s decision to ditch its tried and tested England team and bring in a German was a bold one, particularly at this stage in the competition, but Klinsmann is no novice to the punditry game and his appearance made for a lovely moment early on as Lineker reminded the former forward of the time Germany’s Euro ‘96-winning squad sang their own version of Three Lions during their homecoming in Frankfurt. “You took the trophy and the song” said the host. Another nice line. Another reminder we were in safe hands.And that’s pretty much how it remained during another glorious, anticipation-building day for England at this World Cup. The modern pundit comes in for a lot of criticism – I’m as guilty as anyone – but most do well in a role that is almost certainly harder than it looks. And it is never more tricky than at times like this, when tub-thumping has to be combined with calm analysis and, on the whole, Lineker, Shearer and Ferdinand provided that alongside the naturally neutral contributions of the German among them.Over in Samara things were a little more heated, which was not a huge surprise given Martin Keown was on co-commentary duties, a man who is to eyebrow-raising statements what Joachim Löw is to sniffing his own fingers. According to the former defender shortly after being introduced by main commentator Guy Mowbray, England’s run at this World Cup has led to people in this country “falling back in love with football”, an observation that ignores the fact people in this country absolutely love football all the time.There followed more Keownisms, most notably in the second-half when the 51-year-old told people who read books to “get a life”, and at one stage I worried for his health, but Keown survived and, it could be argued, was perfectly reflective of the occasion – England dominating a World Cup quarter-final.So on to the semi-final in Moscow, when ITV will again be charge. It may not be what the nation wants but it’s what the nation is getting and Mark Pougatch and his team are sure to do a good job as long as they remember to combine cool heads with the right amount of giddy patriotism.That’s what Lineker and co achieved on Saturday – not getting carried away but not underplaying things either, as seen with how the BBC’s coverage ended clips of the defeat to West Germany at Italia ‘90 followed by Lineker insisting “it’s coming home” while staring at the World Cup trophy. A little bit of everything, a little bit of what we need right now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dba6e87bad7269df3ab3338da2928f19063019cc/0_118_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1c5d258458e948e6e4fa5d01436f32","title":"england into semi finals croatia end russias run world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s quarter-final win, Croatia’s punishing victory over hosts Russia, Cristiano Ronaldo transfer machinations, Croydon bus stops and baby choices"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c60b8ab3c069d2dd0cf6c674ccaf0eaa7f33694/0_109_4434_2661/master/4434.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02cea1d74fd23f6d7ca2ed0d3f9f10d5","title":"russia demobilised early from world cup but with nation won over","story":"Stanislav Cherchesov compared the defeat by Croatia to leaving the army when you don’t want to, though this disappointment does not diminish what the much-maligned team achieved“Who, if not you? When, if not now?” said the two banners held up at one end of the stadium during a stirring rendition of the Russian national anthem. It felt like a call to arms for a group of players who had already exceeded all expectations by hanging around at their own party for far longer than anyone imagined.The show will have to go on without the hosts, however, after Croatia broke Russia’s brave resistance, as well as their hearts, at the end of a long and draining night in Sochi to set up a semi‑final against England in Moscow on Wednesday. There were tears on the pitch and in the stands after Ivan Rakitic converted the winning penalty kick, just as he did in a shootout against Denmark last Sunday, to send Croatia through and bring an end to the Russian fairytale.For a moment it felt as though time stood still as sadness fell over this cavernous arena, where Russia had played with such spirit and courage to stretch Croatia to the limit, showing all their powers of recovery to equalise deep into extra time, just when it appeared as though Stanislav Cherchesov’s players had run themselves into the ground and had nothing else to give.Yet once the bitter pill of defeat had been swallowed, there was a show of pride from the Russia supporters as warm applause reverberated around the stadium.For some the crushing sense of disappointment was still too much. Fedor Smolov, one of two Russian players to miss from the spot – his opening kick was saved by Danijel Subasic – remained in the centre circle alone for five minutes before he was eventually lifted to his feet by one of the backroom staff.Cherchesov put on a brave face afterwards, with the 54 year old as colourful and engaging as ever, despite his obvious hurt. “We feel like conscripts,” he said, trying to help the translator. “It’s like to be ‘demobilised’ a little bit earlier when you wanted to stay in the army for some time longer. It would have been better if we could have stayed until the 15 July.”To get this far, though, was beyond the dreams of most Russian football fans. The lowest-ranked nation in the tournament were a punchbag for their media before a ball had been kicked. They had failed to win in seven matches and the sense of pessimism was overwhelming. “Doomed to fail” ran the headline on the front page of the Moscow Times the day before Russia’s opening game against Saudi Arabia. “Our weakest national team in history,” said Alexander Bubnov, a former USSR defender.How the narrative has strayed from that negative script over the last three weeks. To put Russia’s achievements into some sort of context, this was their first World Cup quarter-final since competing as the Soviet Union, when they got to the last eight four times in succession between 1958 and 1970. Not that Cherchesov or his players were in Sochi to bask in that success.Feeding off the energy of the patriotic and raucous home support, Russia were on the front foot from the outset, pressing high up the pitch, snapping into tackles and attacking with the sort of ambition that had been so badly lacking in their attritional battle with Spain in the previous round. “Ros-Si-Ya!” chanted the Russia fans again and again.Artem Dzyuba, a 6ft 5in wrecking ball up front, epitomised the grit and hunger in the Russia team as he fought for every ball as if his life depended on it. Mário Fernandes, who was the other Russia player to miss in the shootout, was a rampaging presence on the right and Denis Cheryshev, linking so well with Dzyuba before curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner, produced another marvellous goal to add to his World Cup collection.In the end it was not quite enough, but Russia’s players can leave the World Cup with their heads high and with the president’s praise ringing in their ears. “Vladimir Putin called me earlier in the day and right now, and he congratulated us on a very good game,” Cherchesov said. “He said what we showed on the field was great.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/788d75f22d0c8b1321e908446f41b618063d92f7/0_116_4084_2451/master/4084.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65664de878a89aaa3c0f812c468e1c5c","title":"dele alli england freedom world cup","story":"Rare goal against Sweden can spur the midfielder to greater heights as England’s World Cup adventure continuesThe hour-mark was approaching when Dele Alli’s moment arrived. England had pinned Sweden deep inside their own territory, patiently sizing up when to deliver the critical pass as teammates manoeuvred themselves into position and flustered opponents sensed impending disaster. It was Jesse Lingard who eventually arced over the cross and there, the wrong side of Emil Krafth at the far post, was Alli to connect sweetly with his header.The midfielder flashed a glance towards the assistant referee for reassurance that there would be no flap of a flag, before out came all those dance routines and intricate handshakes that had been in storage at this level since October 2016. Not since Gareth Southgate’s first game in charge, back in the days when the waistcoat was worn by an interim coach, and a distinctly forgettable qualifying victory against Malta, had Alli registered for his country. Now, after 13 scoreless outings and the occasional pang of doubt, not least in the buildup to this quarter-final, there was reward to cherish.He would fling his shirt into the bouncing England support behind one goal after the final whistle before sauntering from the turf, a job professionally done. “Personally, I didn’t think it was one of my better games,” he said. “It was important we had belief in our gameplan, dominating possession but being patient as well, making sure we moved the ball quickly. For the team and the country to be going to the semi-finals … it’s an amazing feeling.”It felt completely fitting that this occasion should be decorated by the midfielder’s rare goal. This had been all about a collective raising their game, a display showcasing their eagerness to graft that Harry Kane had spoken so passionately about on the eve of the match. It was a victory that had not relied upon the captain’s cold class in front of goal and came more courtesy of Jordan Henderson’s authority in central midfield and the boundless energy of the wing-backs of Harry Maguire’s utter dominance in the air and Jordan Pickford’s excellence.The success ended up appearing comfortable but it was three saves the goalkeeper summoned after the interval that deflated what little ambition remained in Swedish ranks. A first clean sheet of the tournament was his reward.Key to it all had been the energy, invariably offered by that trio of forward-thinkers hovering with menace at the lone forward’s back. That was what truly set England apart from the workaholic plod of Janne Andersson’s selection. Alli, Lingard and Raheem Sterling had stretched Sweden whenever there was a zip to England’s delivery from midfield. They were at their fluent best when the passes were slid first-time before opponents had time to adjust, the runners forever readying themselves to scuttle into space behind a wall of yellow shirts.Lingard’s form under Southgate has been revelatory, more than justifying the trust placed in him. Sterling still looks uncertain in front of goal but he spread panic in Samara, where Sweden were permanently alarmed he might infiltrate their backline and dart in behind. He should have doubled the English advantage when Henderson clipped him free in the last minute of the first period. How Alli, hovering ignored in space to Sterling’s left, his arm briefly raised as he hollered for a pass, would have craved a ball slipped square.The Spurs midfielder had needed a spark, something to kickstart his campaign. There had previously been no rhythm to his tournament through no fault of his own, other than perhaps that understandable desire to remain on the pitch a little too long in Volgograd, which served to exacerbate the thigh strain he had suffered. The injury cost him further involvement in the group stage, while the particular demands of the knockout tie against Colombia, where aggressive opponents pinned him back, meant he rarely occupied the areas where he tends to thrive for his club.Southgate had needed to coax more from the 22-year-old here and, where Alli had occasionally been sloppy up to the interval, his passing hit and miss, he thrived once pushed slightly further upfield after the break. or the first time since the opening quarter against Tunisia, England benefited from Alli at his most effective. Suddenly there was space in which to revel, sightings of goal and the opportunity for inter-play with teammates.If the management had briefly contemplated picking Eric Dier, pushing Henderson into the No 8 role, then this was vindication for retaining the faith.“We thought balls to the far post and late runs from midfield could cause them a problem,” Southgate said. “Dele’s done a super job defensively for the team over here but he’s at his best when he’s making those runs in the inside channel, as he does for his club. Here, instead of Christian Eriksen, it was Jesse Lingard providing for him.”He will be bolstered by this display. This, at last, feels like his stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ae35d199967c744d174562842967bd3ca1fdfd7/0_265_5110_3066/master/5110.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25a955fb95d74283bf974aca01cdbd79","title":"world cup 2018 news and reaction as england set up croatia semi final live","story":"Russia’s run to the last eight might not have been possible without Sergei Ignashevich’s decision to come out of retirement before the World Cup. Russia’s defence had been a sorry shambles in the buildup to the tournament and this had not gone unnoticed by the defender, who turns 39 next week. He helped bring authority and a cool head to their defence and hammered home a couple of penalties in emphatic style too. He’s now decided to hang his boots up once more. And he retires a hero. “There’s an endless stream of messages on WhatsApp and Instagram and no way to tell everyone, ‘Thank you for the kind words’,” he wrote. “I couldn’t imagine that I would finish my football career on such a high note! I’m happy I was part of this team, with this coach, and of our country’s football for nearly 20 years.”Krish has tweeted this morning to suggest his favourite goals from this World Cup and I’ve risked turning this blog into a chart show by including them.The big omission for me in this list is Edinson Cavani’s first goal against Portugal. The long-range one-two that preceded it was just brilliant and there was something about the speed with which the ball thumped in off his head that elevated it beyond the usual cross-header goals you see. Wonderful. England fans brought a bit of 2017 humour with them to Samara yesterday.Andrew Roth has done a fine job of capturing the mood in Russia after the valiant hosts were sent tumbling out of the tournament on penalties. After Croatia prevailed on penalties, there was a shocked silence, and people began to file home, quietened and depressed. Outside the stadium in Sochi, there was something like a dialogue. ‘Smolov is a jackass!’ yelled one teenager. ‘Hey, don’t curse our guys, they gave it their all tonight,’ a middle-aged man with a ponytail said and continues on his way. ‘Igor Igor Akinfeev! Oh!’ another man yells. ‘Igor, come here I’d like to have a word with you,’ howled a woman, playing the disappointed wife, tottering down the street in heels. Her friends laughed tipsily. People have different ways of dealing with grief. “Not much mention of Jordan Henderson this morning but he has definitely been the driving force of the team during this World Cup,” cheers Bob Wilcox. “He’s very much the ‘quarterback’, from his distribution to his organisation of the set play routines.”Jürgen Klopp’s in agreement with you Bob: He’s been very mature, a proper leader in the team. You can see it. Everybody can see that this England team is offensively very skilled. And you need a few serious persons in the team to keep it all together. I like how he’s doing that. He’s still involved in all the offensive things, set-pieces and all that stuff. He’s also made a few wonderful passes. He controls the game and I really like that.His reading of the game has improved immeasurably at Liverpool in the past season. He can second-guess opponents much better than he was capable of a couple of seasons ago. If you have that ability to you can keep a little bit in reserve for when you really do have to press, which is why he is finishing games so strongly in my opinion. Also, I wonder what James Milner was thinking yesterday when he was playing in Liverpool’s 7-0 friendly win at Chester? Surely his form would have earned him a place in the England squad if he’d been available? Then again, his fine form last season was probably in part down to the fact he had his feet up when others were on international duty.This theory for why Henry is on the Belgian bench and not the French one on Tuesday is pretty interesting: Another interesting sub-plot in the Belgium-France semi is the presence of Thierry Henry as assistant manager on Belgium’s bench.Indeed. As a French fan, I think his input would have been beneficial for Les Bleus. But then, despite his heroics in 1998 and 2000 when we won two successive tournaments, maybe he has too much baggage with our national team. 2010 in particular (dubious qualification in the playoffs vs Ireland), the strike and the bus, etc.I also think he might be more enthused by Martinez\u0027s style of football than Deschamps\u0027. And I don\u0027t blame him for this.Anyway, this article in French is pretty interesting:http:www.leparisien.frsportsfootballcoupe-du-mondefrance-belgique-comment-thierry-henry-s-est-eloigne-des-bleus-08-07-2018-7811883.phpI agree that Henry must be so much more enthused by Martínez’s style than Deschamps’s and bringing in his star quality into the dressing-room to help embolden Martínez was a shrewd move by Belgium. They can’t shout “show us your medals” at Thierry. David Hills has been busy penning week four of his World Cup diary. It’s brilliant, of course. Here’s a taster:  Quote of the weekNeymar – shutting down fake news about “arrogance” and simulation before he went home. “I don’t care much for criticism … In the last two matches I didn’t talk to the press. Maybe they’re just showing off. I think it’s more an attempt to undermine me than anything else.”• Also upset by it: Brazil coach Tite – attacking “unfair” ing slurs, including remarks from Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio that Neymar sets “a very negative example to all children”. (Tite’s view in 2012 when he was Corinthians coach, recirculated online last week: “Neymar sets a bad example for children, for all those growing up. He just drops and rolls.”)“Harry Maguire and Jordan Pickford were magnificent, but can we all agree that John Stones is looking the player he has always threatened to be?” gushes Matthew Loten. “Calm and assured in the middle of the three, and a brick wall when he has needed to be.” I wonder if Pep will have taken any notice or if he couldn’t give a flying one how his players have performed under managers he probably regards as being beneath him? I read somewhere the other day that scouts are not swayed by tournament performances as much as they used to be (see Rodriguez, J, Colombia at Brazil 2014). I wonder if the same goes for managers watching squad players impress in the first team? Mind you, Pep has definitely influenced Southgate when it comes to taking risks at the back in possession for the greater good. “On the subject of the Kane Train,” begins Ken Aylmer, “the World Cup is a place to display our National characteristics so my daughter Ella thinks the English players are forming an orderly queue for the ball at corners.” Having heard him wax lyrical about repeats of 80s films on daytime TV before coming in for a late shift at the , I think it’s fair to say that Sachin Nakrani likes watching TV. So, who better placed to give an opinion on the BBC’s coverage of Sweden v England yesterday?And to answer a question in his piece, I think Frank Lampard was replaced in the BBC’s team because he’s started his job as Derby manager now. “It’s fun listening to and reading the thoughts of those who cover England,” writes David Seare. “After years of analysing failure they’re trying to explain this sudden arrival in a semi-final. It seems to me that a bit of luck combined with finding a way to score goals (the more grapple-free approach to set pieces) and a more solid-looking shape than we expected are to blame.“That combined with the happy accident of a coach who learned his business in junior international football and players selected to serve the team rather than some players picked for who they are and then thrown on the pitch to see what happens have made a refreshing change. We shouldn’t try to explain it but just ride the wave until it crashes on the shore. Logic suggests the semi-final might be the end but who knows what lies round the corner?”Here’s a suggestion: “To call England’s brilliant set-piece routine ‘the love train’ doesn’t sit well with me. Has anybody suggested ‘the Kane train’ yet?” Well, you just have Torbjorn Karlsen.But seeing as this World Cup is rapidly turning into the third summer of love, how about the Groovy Train? It’s a good excuse to post this anyway:He took his time, but Dele Alli finally came to the England party yesterday. Here’s Dominic Fifield’s take on the attacking midfielder’s display. Southgate had needed to coax more from the 22-year-old here and, where Alli had occasionally been sloppy up to the interval, his passing hit and miss, he thrived once pushed slightly further upfield after the break. For the first time since the opening quarter against Tunisia, England benefited from Alli at his most effective. Suddenly there was space in which to revel, sightings of goal and the opportunity for inter-play with teammates … He will be bolstered by this display. This, at last, feels like his stage.An now for an important question from Hubert O’Hearn: “Who should England send to sit at the right hand of Gianni Infantino and opposite Kolinda Grabar Kitarović? Theresa May in Ginger Spice’s patriotic dress? Deep down inside I’m hoping for Danny Dyer.” England’s new-found political powerhouse might be too busy preparing a thesis on Brexit, so how about Ross Kemp, with his top off, the absolute mad man? He was at it again yesterday. Obviously. “How much love do you think Big Sam would be getting if he was still in charge and England were set-piecing their way to World Cup glory?” asks Niall Mullen. “Instead of waistcoats would people be downing pints of wine in tribute?” I think plenty of England fans are doing that regardless. Maybe considering a career change to that of a firefighter would be the ultimate tribute.On the subject of kits, James Walton writes: “I thought the Fifa guidance was that the home team always wears their preferred shirt (light or dark) and thus the away team wears the opposite. If that is the case, Croatia are deemed to be the home team so should wear whitered. But I am not sure Fifa would allow that against England in either colour. So surely then Croatia must wear blackblue and England will wear the light colour (white).” I think that will be the case, though I’m sure Croatia would prefer their red and white check, which I’m a huge fan of. And for me, they play better in that kit too. Another interesting sub-plot in the Belgium-France semi is the presence of Thierry Henry as assistant manager on Belgium’s bench. It’s not often – if ever – you get a World Cup winner from your own nation plotting against you. It feels as if he should be sat around with Les Bleus telling them tales of his footballing battles of yore won rather than Belgium’s talented squad. If Toby Alderweireld’s pre-World Cup comments are anything to go by, Henry will play the role of chief raconteur over the next couple of days while Roberto Martínez wrestles with what tactics to employ.Thierry Henry is really important for us. He tells us stories from his playing days and they inspire us. If he says something, it is always turns out to be something helpful. His presence, his World Cup experience, it is all a very positive influence.What a brilliantly odd pair Martínez and Henry are. Hats off to the Belgian FA for bringing them together. I imagine there are some seriously positive vibes in the Belgian dressing room – and lots of Jason Derulo! Belgium v France is one hell of a tasty semi-final isn’t it? You could argue they’re the two strongest squads in the tournament. And while France have shown in flashes what they’re capable of it still feels as though they have more to give. As for Belgium, well, perhaps beating Brazil was their footballing rite of passage. Their counter-attacking ability is frightening and Eden Hazard, Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku are all bang in form in a way that France’s key players are perhaps not. I feel that N’Golo Kanté may have a big say in which way this tie goes. If he can stop De Bruyne, then he may limit Belgium’s ability to hurt France. Mind you, they have so many other possible tormentors, Kanté may take his “km-ran” statistics into world-record territory. “I am not sure if someone has picked this up yet. In the last two games England have conceded just three corners in total,” writes Gokul Kannan. “Colombia had Yerry Mina who had scored twice coming into the game and did score with the first opportunity he got in that game. Sweden had Granqvist who is a giant too. I haven’t looked into this in detail, and I am not sure if this has been a conscious effort by Southgate. Hell, I am not even sure if this is even possible. Planningtraining to not concede corners. But, if it is and Southgate has done this, then I am very very impressed.” You could argue that the way England look to play out from the back means they’re probably less likely to concede possession and enable opponents to run at them quite so often, which could lead to a corner being conceded. Not having a back four is possibly a factor too. The wing-back might intercept the opposition winger earlier – perhaps conceding a throw-in instead of a corner. The way Gareth Southgate has continued to encourage building from the back is the thing that has impressed me most about his coaching. So often England teams clipped the line from the full-back position and gave away possession. He’s somehow coached fear out of the team. And that’s some feat. I think Croatia’s president, Kolinda Grabar Kitarović, might be more Up For The Cup than Theresa May on Wednesday evening. This is some seriously passionate dressing-room bouncing. Morning, and thanks Jonathan. So we know who the four semi-finalists are – and they’re all European! Which is great for football in Europe but seems a shame for the World Cup, given what phenomenal support the South American nations have had in Russia. Peru, Colombia, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil’s supporters have brought colour and noise to Russia in abundance. Maybe they’ll be in attendance at the semi-finals as neutrals, or maybe France, Belgium, England and Croatia fans will be busy online procuring tickets from those South Americans who are now homeward bound. Either way, they deserve a tip of the hat.Righto, it’s time for me to hand this page over to Gregg Bakowski. Your company has been as splendid as always. I’ll catch you again somewhere like this later in the week. When Des read If at the end of France 98 it gave me goose bumps then and has stuck with me.So much of this tournament, from an English perspective, whether fan, player, media or whatever is wrapped up in this.Could anyone get away with anything like this any more? Is the modern world just too snarky?Have any England players done enough in Russia to force their way into all-time XI reckoning?Good question, and I don’t have the answer to hand. I presume England will be in white regardless but Croatia could turn out in their red and white check or their black and blue number. My presumption is the latter as that would best satisfy FIFA’s light vs. dark requirement.On the other half of the draw France and Belgium are preparing for a mouthwatering semi-final. It represents another opportunity for Eden Hazard to stamp his class on Russia 2018, and as Jonathan Wilson explains perhaps take him one step closer to the Bernabéu. Hazard is very different, quieter, more introverted, less self-confident. He will not illuminate a room with a smile. He will not send hordes of impressionable teenagers clutching the latest snap of their hero to the hairdressers. He may not relish the circus that Madrid so often becomes.But he will follow a tactical plan, he will not overelaborate and he will devastate a full-back who gives him half a chance. In a post-Ronaldo world, Hazard may be just the non-celebrity Real Madrid need. Whatever else he is, he is a supremely skilful and effective footballer.Lots of emphasis on the all-European semifinals, but every World Cup hosted in Europe has had at least three European teams as top four (in four occasions - not including 2018 - all top four were from Europe) :1934 (Italy) : 4 1938 (France) : 3 1954 (Switzerland) : 3 1958 (Sweden) : 3 1966 (England) 4 1974 (West Germany) : 31982 (Spain) : 41990 (Italy) : 31998 (France) :32006 (Germany) : 4“Regarding all the love and appreciation for Southgate,” emails Paul Hayes, “I spotted this the other day when looking back on the live blog from Allardyce’s sacking in 2016. I know, a live blog comment which has not aged well - shocking, eh? I wonder what “MalcolmsPond” makes of him now...? But I suppose it did reflect a school of thought at the time.”Southgate is uninspiring but the qualification group is easy enough they should be OK. You wouldn\u0027t want him in charge for the actual World Cup though.Having him as a stopgap then going for Wenger next summer would seem the obvious best plan to me.It sure did, and I count myself among the number who doubted Southgate’s appointment. After all, there wasn’t anything on his CV to indicate we should have expected what has unfolded. It’s difficult to believe a run to the World Cup semis could be anything other than a unifying force but there is plenty going on in Croatia to undercut the gains made by Luka Modric and co.Russia’s disappointment at falling agonisingly short against Croatia was evident, but the hosts added greatly to this World Cup with their unexpected run to the quarter-finals, as Stuart James reports.To get this far, though, was beyond the dreams of most Russian football fans. The lowest-ranked nation in the tournament were a punchbag for their media before a ball had been kicked. They had failed to win in seven matches and the sense of pessimism was overwhelming. “Doomed to fail” ran the headline on the front page of the Moscow Times the day before Russia’s opening game against Saudi Arabia. “Our weakest national team in history,” said Alexander Bubnov, a former USSR defender.After Croatia’s win Luka Modric acknowledged back-to-back penalty shootouts was taking its toll ahead of Wednesday’s semi-final with England. “We’ve played two times 120 minutes in six days and, of course, this will leave a mark on you. But thank God, we’ve shown our character. We had to run a lot. I agree we should have finished the job earlier – we hit the woodwork and had chances. We should have maintained our focus after we took the lead in extra time but, unfortunately, there was a lapse in concentration on the free-kick.England’s comfortable path to the semi-finals is in contrast to their opponents in the final four, Croatia. For the second match in a row they prevailed after 120 minutes and a penalty shootout. David Hytner was in Sochi to witness all the drama.With several of their stars including Rakitic, Modric, Subasic and Mario Mandzukic the wrong side of 30, it feels as though it could be now or never for this Croatia team in terms of football’s biggest prize. They continue to believe it will be now.The ICH memes keep coming. This one ties the room together. “Wondering if you could advise if any Croatia players are suspended for the semis and how that may affect their team,” asks Antony Bellingall. No Croatia players are suspended for the semi Antony. Four were booked against Russia but none of the eight who were at risk of suspension. The accumulation of yellow cards is no longer a consideration for the four remaining teams, meaning a semi-final sending off is the only way a player can be suspended for the final. Unplug your ears anywhere in the world right now and the chances are you’ll hear It’s Coming Home in a matter of seconds. Nick Ames spoke to Rick Blaskey, one of the brains behind the unstoppable earworm. “There’s a lot of love for this England squad, and as Jamie Doward reports, it’s a love felt nationwide.”Not just nationwide. Last night I’d planned to watch the game on an outdoor screen here in Ulaanbaatar, but the skies looked like they were about to open so an hour before kickoff we moved to my local, a big pub with a couple of dozen large tables inside.When we got there we saw reserved signs on every table. I asked the bar manager, Daagi, if we could move a table in from the beer garden and occupy a space near the big screen that wasn’t being used. “Sorry, that’s reserved too.”I’ve lived in Mongolia through three World Cups now, and I’ve never struggled to get a table in my local for a quarter final. I’ve never seen so many England shirts on display either.Spare a thought for Sweden.Who was your man-of-the-match yesterday? I agree with Martha Kelner’s choice of Jordan Pickford. I also think the back three deserve credit. Time and again this World Cup they’ve brought the ball out of defence and set England on their way, and with such composure. It feels like this might be the tipping point in how we appraise English defenders.There’s a lot of love for this England squad, and as Jamie Doward reports, it’s a love felt nationwide. But this wasn’t just a victory, it was a national exorcism. The ignominy of losing against Iceland in the European championship two years ago evaporated like spilled beer in the hot English sun as thousands of pub gardens up and down the land reverberated to the chorus of Three Lions and an inexperienced, youngish team stood unblinking in the full adulation of a nation hungry for joy and heroes.I\u0027ve been trying to work out how and why this is happening, and I think I\u0027ve worked it out. England will be winning the final with twenty minutes to go and then north Korea will launch a rocket and there will be global thermonuclear war. It will be the universes biggest trick on me yet.Jordan Pickford left the Samara Stadium with a bandaged hand but as Dominic Fifield reports it’s nothing to worry about. It was a daft injury by myself. I went to punch the floor and ended up punching my knee and hurt my thumb. It was a bit of anger. But I’m a man, not a mouse. I’m fine and I’ll live another day, won’t I?Southgate’s unifying force can even be felt at Dutch barbecues. Yesterdays match felt very assured. Well, what I saw of it. I was hosting impromptu bbq to watch the match and invited all the English people I know in my town (I live in the Netherlands). Everyone I invited came and was so enthusiastic about this side. Thank you Gareth Southgate for bringing together a side that people want to watch and celebrate.Southgate’s post-match comments are reported by Dominic Fifield. I wonder, are we likely to see a spike in babies being christened Gareth around April next year? Or perhaps Jordan or Harry? Apparently, after 1966, there was a boom in the number of Roberts (Charlton) Alans (Ball) and Geoffs (Hurst).Like all of us, Barney Ronay is increasingly enamoured with Gareth Southgate.Whatever happens from here we will always have the pleasure of watching this process develop, the decency of Southgate’s motives and his ideals on how his team should prepare and present themselves. It has been surprising at first, then admirable, then encouraging. For the first time in Samara it just felt like a blast.Here’s Daniel Taylor’s match report from Samara. At the final whistle, the victorious players converged on one another. It took a few seconds for them to gather their breath and then, finally, they could join the party that was already under way behind the goal to their right. England had booked their place in a World Cup semi-final and this kind of euphoria has been so long coming – more than a quarter of a century since the last occasion – it was probably just inevitable they would soon be dancing on the pitch as well as in the stands.Keown somehow managed to make himself unpopular on what must have been the most collectively joyful day in England since 1996.Let’s ease our way into proceedings with the help of the pod. In this edition Barry retells the famous Bill Hicks gag about reading, following Martin Keown’s suggestion during England’s victory that readers need to get a life. Flipping heck. This was not supposed to happen. Football was not supposed to come home, not really. It was only meant to threaten to come home, to offer the tantalising but never-to-be realised prospect of coming home. Like Chekhov’s gun, forever in view but destined to remain unfired. Now, 180 minutes from football actually coming home we’re dangerously close to it going off. How are we to process this absurdity?Well, by pumping out memes and jumping through bus shelters, it appears.On this page for the next few hours we can attempt to make sense of it all by sifting through the details of England’s routine (yes routine - hubris be damned) - World Cup quarter-final victory over Sweden. After that there’s the altogether more dramatic Croatian victory over Russia to attend to before casting early glances ahead to the midweek semi-finals.To convince me this is all not a well-rendered fever dream please send me your emails and tweets.

Now she’s made a documentary on society’s obsession with extreme wealth – and its cost to us allDocumentary photographer Lauren Greenfield was trying to form trusting relationships with members of a Mayan tribe in Mexico in the early 1990s when she picked up a discarded copy of Bret Easton Ellis’s Less Than Zero. Before she’d finished the cult novel – which charts the parties, drug taking and sex lives of rich college kids in Los Angeles – Greenfield had decided to swap photography subjects from the Maya of Chiapas to the rich kids of her home town.A quarter of a century later, Greenfield has amassed 500,000 images of the often absurd lives of the wealthy. The highlights – including a picture of go-go dancers hired for a 13-year-old’s bar mitzvah – are published by Phaidon in a £60 2.5kg tome called Generation Wealth. An accompanying behind-the-scenes documentary film is released in the UK next week.Greenfield introduces us to characters all motivated by the accumulation of wealth. “No matter how much people had, they still wanted more,” Greenfield says of her subjects. We meet Florian Homm, a hedge fund manager living in self-imposed exile in Germany to avoid extradition to the US where he has been sentenced to 225 years in jail. Smoking cigars and dripping in gold, Homm, who became known as “the antichrist of finance” for ripping off his investors for hundreds of millions of dollars, tells Greenfield that morality changed in the 80s. “The value system changed completely. It wasn’t about who you are, but about what you are worth… Morals are completely non-productive in that value system.”As his hedge fund was imploding during the financial crisis of 2008, Homm, now 58, fled the €5m Majorcan villa he shared with a 27-year-old Russian lingerie model. With $500,000 stashed in his underwear and a humidor in hand, Homm boarded a plane to Colombia and disappeared for five years. We learn that he used his fortune to buy his son, then 15, the services of a Dutch prostitute. Homm was later arrested at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.One of the photos that best sums up Greenfield’s work is of the DJ, rapper and producer Lil Jon flashing a smile showing $50,000 worth of diamond and platinum dental work. There’s also the former porn star Kacey Jordan, who received $30,000 to attend a sex party at Charlie Sheen’s home. Jordan tells Greenfield of seeking greater wealth through extreme sex, which may have made her temporarily wealthier but didn’t make her happy. She made numerous suicide attempts, and ends the film in the same dead-end job she had before starting porn.Then there’s Eden Wood, six, a beauty pageant princess and star of reality TV show Toddlers \u0026amp Tiaras, who tells Greenfield “My favourite princess is me” and says beauty means “that I get money, and I’ll be a superstar.”Greenfield says the intimacy she shares with her subjects at their most vulnerable led her to consider the impact her obsession with their lives has had on her own family, and turns the camera on her sons, mother and husband. Her 16-year-old son Noah tells her: “I got used to growing up without you around. The damage has been done.”The stories Greenfield tells about rich families detached from the world around them, living in bubbles separated from reality by armies of nannies and household staff, chime with my own experiences covering the super-rich as wealth correspondent for the Observer and the . From Knightsbridge to Monaco, the Upper West Side and the Hamptons, the wealthiest people in society are richer than they’ve ever been before. More of them have five, six, seven or even a dozen homes in the world’s most desirable locations and it is not unusual for them to fly their nannies, tutors and security details between them on private jets. Their houses may cost as much as the £135m a Ukrainian billionaire paid for a penthouse in One Hyde Park, but that doesn’t mean they’ll spend much time there.The Boltons, a street of grand Victorian mansions in South Kensington, has been an address that only the very well-heeled can afford since the 19th century. But the influx of wealthy Russian and Middle Eastern families to London means prices have gone beyond the reach of all but the very richest of Brits. The average house price is a fraction under £20m – 88 times the UK average – making it the third most expensive street in the country (after London’s Kensington Palace Gardens and Grosvenor Crescent). Over cups of tea and strawberries and cream at the annual church fête held in a private garden square overlooked by the mansions this summer, locals tell me of a disconnected community. “We must be standing on some of the most expensive real estate in the world,” says David, a long-standing member of the St Mary The Boltons congregation, who lives a few streets away. “But you won’t find any of the owners at our fête. You probably won’t find any of them at home from one month to the next.”A four- storey, nine-bedroom house complete with cinema, indoor swimming pool and Japanese garden sold for £51m in 2015 to an offshore company. The stamp duty alone set back the unknown buyer £7.6m. The owner is paying £220,000 a year in extra tax in order to keep their identity a secret.Greenfield says the true absurdity of extreme wealth hit her when she was documenting the lives of the Siegel family, who were attempting to build the biggest private home in America, for her film The Queen of Versailles. When “timeshare king” David Siegel loses billions in the 2008 financial crisis, the family are forced to travel by commercial jet and one of the children turns and asks, “Mommy, what are all these people doing on our plane?” Greenfield met the Siegels after striking up a friendship with Donatella Versace, whom she met via her work documenting the lives of rich kids in LA. She went back to Crossroads, the $38,000-a-year private school in Santa Monica she’d attended alongside Hollywood’s rich and famous offspring. Greenfield says her position as an “insider and outsider” – she went to the school herself, but her parents (both academics) couldn’t afford to kit her out with the designer bling the other kids had – gave her “exceptional access to the world of the wealthy in LA”.Greenfield never wanted to become an expert on the rich or pass judgement on their lives or spending. “I wanted to be a guide, to take the viewer on a journey and to help them understand the shift in society.” She admits weeping a few times while putting the book and film together. .We meet for lunch at London’s five-star May Fair Hotel, surrounded by fellow diners who could easily be her subjects. “The photos are evidence of a sea change in our values over the last 25 years,” she says. “I felt like we had gone from the American dream of opportunity for all to a desire for ever more wealth, in the currency of money, fame, beauty or youth.” She says it’s not just an issue that effects the wealthy, but everyone in society. “We’re all complicit in generation wealth.” Greenfield interviewed several experts for the film, but just one survived the cut. Former New York Times journalist and leftwing activist Chris Hedges is quoted as saying “Wealth is whatever gives us value” and warns that “Societies accrue their greatest wealth at the moment they face death.” This last remark might trouble Americans in particular: last year Professor Philip Alston, United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty, made a statement accusing Donald Trump and the Republican party of consciously distorting the shape of American society in a “bid to become the most unequal society in the world”.Alston, who acts as a watchdog on extreme poverty, said Trump’s administration had passed tax laws that “overwhelmingly benefitted the wealthy and worsened inequality”. He said Trump’s policies “seem deliberately designed to remove basic protections from the poorest, punish those who are not in employment and make even basic health care into a privilege”.But Greenfield says the chasm between rich and poor was widening well before the reality TV star’s 2016 election. “The American dream – that everyone has equal opportunity – became a fiction long before Trump,” she says. “Americans don’t hate the rich, as they imagine they could become the rich. They don’t want high taxes as they think they could become rich and won’t want to pay them. But what they dream of is an increasingly unbelievable fantasy.”She says that while examining her photos it became clear to her that “We have left behind the American dream of my dad’s generation where there was the possibility of social mobility and the belief that anyone could make it. The things that were valued then – discipline, hard work and frugality – are not so important now. We have a culture that prizes celebrity, bling and narcissism.” Trump, she says, “is the apotheosis of generation wealth. With Trump you have wealth and celebrity achieving the ultimate goal. Trump is the natural evolution of the values of our culture.”When Greenfield started the photography series – which includes portraits of a 12-year-old Kim Kardashian – getting permission from parents to document their kids’ lifestyles sometimes proved difficult. “The parents wanted to be a little discreet – they indulged in the lifestyle but didn’t necessarily want to be seen doing it, but that has changed,” she says. “I went back again in 2007 and the parents’ attitudes had completely changed. A lot of times parents would be present at the interviews and they would be proud, saying: ‘Our kids are just like Paris Hilton.’”“‘Keeping up with the Joneses’ has become ‘keeping up with the Kardashians’,” she says as we tuck into seared tuna with caponata and gambas al pil pil. “Instead of wanting the slightly better house down the street, you want the mansion that Kim has. Reality TV and social media has made the lives of the wealthy more accessible, and it has made people hungrier for it.” The children Greenfield met were sometimes more aware of the potential damage created by free flowing cash than their parents. She recalls a 13-year-old called Adam who told her: “Money ruins kids, money has ruined me”.Greenfield went to Adam’s bar mitzvah and was “blown away” by the scale of the production, including the go-go dancer. “Kids in his circle had to be seen to spend £50,000 on their bar mitzvah or they’re shit out of luck,” she says. Hanging out with Adam affected her more than most of her subjects, because even at 13 he was perceptive enough to know that something had gone wrong. She describes herself as friends with many of her original subjects, including Adam. But he wouldn’t allow her and the cameras back for her latest film.Neither would David Siegel, 83, the real estate mogul she shadowed in The Queen of Versailles. “He hates the way the film ended when he loses the houses,” Greenfield says. “I don’t think David will ever let me back.” But Siegel’s third wife, Jackie, 52, is still friends with Greenfield and attended the premiere of The Queen of Versailles. “She thinks it’s the best thing she ever did,” Greenfield says. Early on, Jackie, a former Mrs Florida beauty pageant winner, told Greenfield: “You can never be too rich or have big enough boobs.” Jackie’s breasts, which have been augmented four times, fill the frame of one photo.At the end of the film, Greenfield says the Siegels appeared to have learnt that wealth is not as important as health and happiness. But, having recovered from the financial crisis, the Siegels bought back the house and extended their ambitious plans. The house built on a man-made hill in a gated community in Orlando will have 14 bedrooms, 32 bathrooms, a 30-car garage, bowling alley, five swimming pools (three indoor, two outdoor), a two-storey cinema and a ballroom with capacity for 500 guests. The much delayed house is set to be finally habitable next year.“They had this realisation that it was family that mattered,” Greenfield says. “Yet they are back at the house building bigger and better. I wonder, did we really learn anything from the financial crash, or did we just go back to the way it had always been? In the US and the UK we fixed a broken system and now the real estate market is even more on fire, the stock market is up and Trump is the president and tax laws are making things even more unequal.”Josef Stadler, the lead author of UBS’s report, says his billionaire clients are aware of the widening gulf between rich and poor and fear that hard-pressed people might rise up and take direct action. “We’re at an inflection point,” he says. “Wealth concentration is as high as in 1905, this is something billionaires are concerned about. The question is, to what extent is that sustainable and at what point will society intervene and strike back?”He says the “$1bn question” is how society will react to the concentration of so much money in the hands of so few. Anger at so-called robber baron families who built up vast fortunes from monopolies in US rail, oil, steel and banking in the late 19th century, an era of rapid industrialisation and growing inequality in America that became known as the Gilded Age, led to President Roosevelt breaking up companies and trusts and increasing taxes on the wealthy in the early 1900s. “Will there be similarities in the way society reacts to this gilded age?” Stadler asked. Looking back on her work, Greenfield recalls being startled by ostentatious displays of wealth but says what might have been shocking then is day-to-day reality now. In her first few days visiting Crossroads, three boys asked her what she was doing by the school gates every day. When she told them she was working on a documentary about growing up in LA, they told her it was “all about money” and pulled cash out of their pockets, posing for the camera.“It wasn’t until I developed the film that I saw that these 13-year-olds were waving $100 bills.” Generation Wealth is in cinemas from 17 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1538fa73ed69884178de6636fe9d00d0edfaaeb4/0_473_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05222b999367619b64d97df7ff5a4226","title":"a quick note to say thank you to my grandfather for his love of history","story":"Student Inguild Zaar Henriksen says she devoured history books her grandfather gave her as a child, sparking an interest that has hugely enriched her lifeI was only eight years old when my grandfather gave me a set of books about history. They covered lots of different moments in ancient times. I remember one was all about Egypt, another concentrated on Greece, another focused on the Incas and the final one was all about America.I devoured them. I was totally captivated by the stories of people who had lived so long ago, and whose lives were in many ways so different from ours and in other ways exactly the same.Those books made me realise that though history is about big world events and politics, it’s also about the ordinary lives of ordinary people. It’s about personal history, in other words.Reading the books sparked a major love of history in me, and now I’m thinking of studying it at university.Maybe in time I’ll follow in my grandfather’s footsteps and teach history, who knows?

The feeling of a world expanding as the boundaries of its grey, slightly frayed arrangements for announcing love, shift. And one result of this change, after a campaign by the London couple Charles Keidan and Rebecca Steinfeld, who have been tirelessly pushing for the opportunity to enter into a civil partnership (which until last week applied only to same-sex couples), is that with this expansion, cracks have appeared in the traditions we’ve held dear for centuries. Suddenly, doesn’t marriage look a bit… silly?I speak as someone who’s been with the same person since I was 23, but missed the opportunity to get married when it really made sense, after a year or two when there were still patches of each other’s personalities we were yet to discover, when our commitment to each other was not yet grounded in mortgages, children and cats. When the relationship was small and malleable enough that it required shaping with the cold hand of ceremony. Instead of formalising it with a wedding, we bought a flat. Ahh I loved that flat, we loved that flat, with its chicken smell up from the kebab shop downstairs and the screeching drug deals that serenaded us for 10 short years. We got a new kitchen, instead of a ring. And I speak as someone who’s been to very few weddings, compared with acquaintances on Instagram whose summers appear as a B-roll of white dresses and hashtags of conjoined names and Cotswolds champagne, so perhaps I am ill-equipped to discuss the modern wedding and all its flaws. But I want to, so let’s go.The expansion of possibilities beyond marriage means we can now stand back from the wedding and consider it afresh, as one of many options with which to celebrate love. And from this distance, a wedding looks not unlike a historical re-enactment, or live-action roleplay. He’s the orc, you’re the elf. The costumes are accurate, down to the face-coverings, as is the choreography. Rather than theatrical jousting or the hurling of lightning bolts, there is the walk down the aisle and exchange of rings. Scripts have usually not been altered for generations, these grand dull monologues with words only repeated in churches or fields and only then by a stranger with another job on in Osterley at three.Neither marriage nor civil partnership are ideal. The first carries the weight of centuries of subjugation, of institutionalised inequality between the genders, women the property of their fathers before being handed to husbands the legal position of married women in the 19th century was little short of that of a slave. The second is still smoky with the stench of its history as a consolation prize to gay couples when a homophobic society, under pressure to modernise, was still unable to bring itself to fling open the doors to “actual” marriage. The rights and protections for both are the same the difference is in the language. When you enter a civil partnership, though you’re not dealing with religion, you are accepting state regulation of your relationship whether you stay together or are the one in three who orce. And yet of course, for all my cynical moaning, there’s joy in both, for both are opportunities to make a party out of a relationship, and invite other people in to dance around it and eat cake. However, as last week’s success proves, with Charles Keidan and Rebecca Steinfeld’s argument focused on the basis that marriage is outmoded, patriarchal, and built on inequality, there is no need to settle for what we’re given.I would push for an alternative partnership, one rooted not in the graveyard of ancient patriarchy or modern homophobia, but in new ground. How has it taken so long to get here? The fact that ministers spent £65,000 fighting Keidan and Steinfeld’s case, seemingly only in order to reinforce outdated sexist values, adds a darker energy to this move onward, out of the past. And it needn’t rely on the expensive trappings of romance, either, with its pink-lit fairy tales and insistence on forever, its promises so shallow they can be written on a grain of rice. Its weddings that cost more than the entire relationship to date, including the time you booked the wrong train and had to get a taxi all the way to Brighton. Its weightloss and white dresses, its scrabble for the bouquet as if this is the bride’s friends only chance to take control of their own chance at happiness. But neither should it be scrubbed of the ecstasy of love in a ceremony so embarrassed of its own weight that it must be mumbled quickly and explained away with death and taxes. A signature on paper, done, and what? An afternoon off work, an insistence nothing has changed.The widening of language, of possibilities, is exciting and necessary. I look forward now to a hundred new types of commitment ceremonies, partnerships, weddings a hundred new ways to say I love you.After Danny Dyer spoke the most reassuring truth about Brexit, calling David Cameron a twat on TV, twice, an unlikely fan was revealed, with Lena Dunham tweeting, ‘My obsession with Danny Dyer is real and I think about him on average four times a week.’ Two of my worlds collided.

Anyone with a plant in a pot will already be wondering when they are going to stop. By August we will all be begging for mercy. I like them best when they are small, halved or sliced lengthways, cooked on the grill, then dropped into a dressing of olive oil, lemon and basil. That way, they can be tossed with pappardelle and capers or served with paper-thin slices of beef or with grilled prawns. You can tuck them into a soft bun with garlic mayonnaise, and I particularly value them with grated parmesan, more basil and lumps of burrata.You can stop the courgettes in their tracks by cooking the flowers. A light airy batter in scarily hot oil and you have crackling fritters to serve with a wedge of lemon and grains of salt. This time I swapped my usual accompaniments for a bowl of fresh, soft cheese through which I had stirred salted, grated courgette.Summer squashes are the easiest of all home-grown vegetables. They ask little more than sunshine and plenty of water, litres of the stuff. But a couple of plants will provide you with lots of fruits once they get going. I grow them in deep pots on the back steps. As the summer blazes on, you become quite blasé about your bounty of golden flowers and green fruits, and then suddenly they are gone, their dinner plate leaves reduced to a crisp, their energy spent. But for now, there’s more than enough.I am not usually the guy to tell anyone to remove the fat from a piece of beef, but for this, a dish where the meat is eaten raw, it is essential. The strip of creamy beef fat that you have removed is useful: keep it in the fridge, clingfilm wrapped, then use pieces of it in place of olive oil to start frying vegetables, particularly onions. Keep the heat low, so liquid fat runs from the lump, then turn up the heat slightly and cook your vegetables. Onions, fried on a low heat for a good 20 to 30 minutes, are wonderful this way.Serves 2beef 300g, topside or sirloincourgettes 2, medium sizeFor the dressing:lemon juice 75mlolive oil 100mlginger 40gThai basil 10gRemove all fat from the topside. It is well worth taking your time over this. Wrap the meat tightly in clingfilm and place in the freezer for an hour. This is simply to make the beef easier to carve thinly, it will not freeze.Slice the courgettes lengthways very thinly. You can use a vegetable peeler if you prefer, taking long strokes from the length of each courgette. Discard the seedy core.Put the lemon juice in a mixing bowl, add the olive oil and season with salt. Peel the ginger and grate finely into the oil and lemon juice. Tear the basil leaves or shred them with a knife and add to the dressing.Warm a grill or griddle pan. Toss the courgettes briefly into the dressing then place on the griddle, letting them colour lightly, about 2 minutes on each side. As each one becomes ready, remove from the heat and return to the dressing, tossing lightly to coat.Remove the beef from the freezer and slice very thinly with a long, thin-bladed carving knife. Each slice should be cut as thin as you can. (If necessary you can place the meat between two sheets of greaseproof paper or clingfilm and bat it gently with a rolling pin to get it as thin as possible.) Place the slices of beef in a single layer on a plate as you go.Remove the courgettes from the dressing and arrange on two plates together with the slices of beef. Trickle the dressing over, grind a little black pepper and serve.I suggest a soft cheese for this. Something light and creamy, such as a robiola, would work nicely, or perhaps a milky ricotta.For the batter:plain flour 95gcornflour 25gice-cold water 175mlegg white of 1 largeFor the cheese accompaniment:courgettes 3 small onesbutter 30golive oil 3 tbspfresh, white cheese 300gFor frying:groundnut or sunflower oil a deep panMake the batter by combining the plain flour and cornflour in a mixing bowl. Pour in the cold water – it must be ice cold – and mix without bashing out the lumps that form. You don’t want a smooth batter. Set aside in the fridge for an hour.Prepare the accompaniment. Wipe, then coarsely grate the courgettes. Melt the butter in a shallow pan set over a moderate heat then pour in the olive oil. Add the grated courgettes to the hot fat, lower the heat and let it cook for 5 or 6 minutes until it starts to soften and become tender. It shouldn’t colour beyond a bright, pale green.Transfer the courgettes to a bowl then fold in the soft, fresh cheese and season generously with salt and black pepper.Get the oil hot. Beat the egg white to a froth, but not so much that it will stand in peaks, then mix it loosely into the batter. Dip the courgette flowers, one by one, into the batter then lower them carefully into the hot oil. Let them fry for 2 or 3 minutes until pale. Remove them before the batter turns gold and drain on kitchen paper. Serve immediately, while the batter is still crisp, with a bowl of the courgette and cheese at its side.

It looked like a mini castle with a tower red-bricked and handsome, a portal to another time with its stained-glass windows. Back then, I had no idea who lived there. Later, I discovered it belonged to the guitarist and music producer Jimmy Page, erstwhile of Led Zeppelin. I knew I had no hope of ever stepping inside. But life can throw some crazy stuff at you and three decades later, I am invited to visit. I tell Page all of this before he has even fully flexed the door on its hinges, “Well I’m so glad you came then,” he smiles, giving me a hearty handshake.The Tower House actually has two front doors: the half bevelled-glass street door which leads into a mosaic lobby and the actual house door, adorned with brass sculptures showing the Ages of Man. Then, the only way I can describe what happens next is: imagine going to a party and all your best friends are there wearing the most opulent clothes of their lives, and they come and say hello all at once, and for a moment, you are so giddy you can’t compute. This is what entering the Tower House is like.It was designed by the self-styled “art architect” William Burges between 1875 and 1881, in the 13th-century French Gothic style. Burges was well travelled, meticulous about research and detail, uncompromising in his use of materials, obsessed with the Middle Ages and was a skilled metalworker, jeweller and designer before he became an architect. He ran with an arty set: Leighton, Rossetti, Burne-Jones et al was sociable, chronically myopic and even his best friends described him as ugly. He had quite a sense of humour and was absolutely not a cheap architect. Everything he’d ever learned and loved went into Tower House because it was to be his home.Sadly, he was only to live at the house for three years. He died aged 53 in his red bed in the Mermaid Room on the first floor, under painted friezes of waves and swimming fish, and a ceiling of gilt stars studded with convex mirrors. He was next to his painted wardrobe which Page managed to buy back and return to the spot Burges intended it for. (Much of the house’s contents were sold off in 1933.)And here I am now, standing with Page (dressed entirely monochromatically) in the double-height entrance hall, on a mosaic floor depicting the combat between Theseus and the Minotaur, trying to take it all in.The principal rooms in the Tower House all have themes (Time, Love, Literature) and tell a story every room has stained-glass windows, elaborate carvings, frescoes, friezes and if there is a surface that can be embellished or adorned, in the utmost complexity, using the finest of materials, it will be. The chimney pieces are imposing and carved with 3D figures the one in the library depicts the Principles of Speech in Caen stone.The hall’s theme is Time, with giant, almost life-size frescoes depicting the sun and moon, and stained-glass windows symbolising the seasons. The ceiling shows the constellations at the exact time Burges moved in. A stone gallery above links the upstairs bedrooms and overlooks the entrance hall. Page says he first viewed the house, back in 1972, in a dim evening light, and it “captured my heart”.The drawing room and library, where Burges entertained his pre-Raphaelite friends, are off the entrance hall. Page bought the house from the actor Richard Harris (John Betjeman had it before him) and when first viewing it, Harris’s Camelot throne was still in the library.The library walls are lined with richly painted Burges bookcases which now house Page’s books. On the ceiling are the founders of law and philosophy. The windows depict the arts and sciences. The drawing room’s theme is Love, and a medieval Cupid is painted on the ceiling. “Is your house always this tidy?” I ask. “I always try to keep it really tidy,” he says, “but at the moment I think it’s pretty untidy.” (It isn’t.) Page has a cleaner twice a week (“I’m guessing it’s not about spraying wood Pledge around?” I ask. “No,” he replies) and a regime of maintaining the house. It was Grade I-listed in 1949 and its interiors are important and fragile. Page describes how, periodically, things such as the walls in the hall need scaffolding and sugar-soaping by specialists. Everything is meticulously well looked after. I think the National Trust has nothing on Jimmy Page.I am particularly interested to see how the kitchen works in a house like this, but Page won’t let me see because “It’s out of bounds, it’s untidy.” I beg until it’s unseemly he doesn’t budge. (I visit one of the “toilet facilities” later which is all dark blue tiles and Edward de Mornay fish borders.)The spiral stairs are in the tower. On the first floor, next to Burges’s old room, is the guest room: the Butterfly Room, a blaze of golds and reds, with a heavily decorated ceiling of butterflies and a deep frieze of plants and flowers.The second floor, less elaborate, houses two nurseries (although Burges never had children). The day nursery – with a theme of Jack and the Beanstalk – has the terrifying giant coming out of the chimney. The night nursery is slightly more benign with grotesque monkeys. We descend the stairs to the dining room which is dominated by a giant circular zodiac table, originally commissioned by Harris. Page is excited to point out that the table is a reflection of the design in the enamelled iron ceiling. Page loves the table, his last book was done on it.Page had to sell the boathouse to buy this house. “It’s like guitars – in those days you had to trade in to go to the next one.” He was 28 when he bought the Tower House (he’s now 74) and he’s been looking after it ever since. It seems very young to take on a Grade I-listed house. Did he understand what was involved? “I knew what a Grade I-listed building was and what a privilege it was to live in something like this, yes.”Tower House is sandwiched between two houses undergoing extensive building work (when we go into the garden later, the noise is deafening). Perhaps the most contentious of the two relates to the house belonging to the singer Robbie Williams. Williams wants to put in a basement complex which will come perilously close to Tower House. Page has appealed and the council has currently deferred a decision pending a tightening up of monitoring and supervision of works. At the moment, no one seems able to guarantee the building work next door won’t damage Tower House’s unique and irreplaceable interiors, which is of serious concern to Page.That there is any debate that Tower House should be protected, is perplexing. The only other residential town house Burges built is Park House in Cardiff. It is also listed and has been described by CADW (Wales’s historic environment protector) as “perhaps the most important 19th-century house in Wales.” When a piece of Burges furniture recently came up for sale (there are very few) it was considered so imperative it didn’t go out of the country that the government placed a temporary export ban on it. The Bedford museum bought it. And yet, Tower House is full of Burges. In 2014, three English Heritage engineers, an EH inspector and a conservation officer visited Tower House and described its interiors as of “high heritage value… and highly vulnerable” and that there was no demonstration that the proposed works would “have no adverse impact”.So protective is Page of the interiors and their sensitivity to vibrations, he only ever plays acoustic guitar in the house, doesn’t have parties there and has no television. Just before I go, Page says, a little sotto voce: “I’m sorry I couldn’t show you the kitchen. But…” he continues, leaning forward, “it’s got a La Cornue in it.” I am thinking which artist that is, and then I realise it’s a French range cooker. I see it as a small concession."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ce1c9cd47b10161725f58dbb25cd9ace8fa2eea/0_713_5029_3017/master/5029.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af9b68b6d8abace536cc1a8db84738f2","title":"the right way to eat a mango nikesh shukla","story":"In the midst of a particularly good mango season, Nikesh tackles his favourite fruit on a busy Paddington concourseI am waiting for a train home in Paddington station and I’ve got an Alphonso mango burning a hole in my bag. Knowing the best way to eat it isn’t exactly pleasant for my fellow hot and sticky commuters, I find a quiet corner of the station and take it out of my bag.I squeeze the mango, watching the board, waiting for my train platform to be announced. I know I have a good 20 minutes to enjoy this mango, so I continue squeezing the fruit, feeling the flesh pulverise under the skin, turning to a juicy pulp of deliciousness. I squeeze until I can feel the skin is about to break. I squeeze until I can nearly touch the stone in the middle. I squeeze until I know it is ready to eat.We’re in the midst of a particularly good mango season, so I’m going to teach you how to eat one properly. You may have been doing it wrong all this time. This is important. A good mango can lift you. A juicy mango can give you as much pleasure as ice cream. A delicious mango can make you forget, for the time it takes to eat it, that the world is a depressing place right now. We could all use some levity. A break. Ten minutes of joy.I know that some of you will slice and dice, and use the knife to cut off pieces into a bowl. Others might take the skin off before slicing off strips. Many of you may just opt for buying ready-sliced pieces from a supermarket. Don’t.I tear a small strip off the top of the mango with my teeth and then raise it to my mouth, squeezing it and letting the pulp gush into my mouth. It is a moment of utter joy.It takes me back… I’m at home, sitting with my mother and sister, dragging slices of mango across my teeth, tearing the flesh into my mouth. Mum is telling us about how, in Aden, they used to take the mango stone, once it had been sucked dry, and put it on the barbecue overnight. Once cooked, it offered up a whole new experience.I’m with my sisters, eating bowls of rus (mango pulp), laughing and rinsing each other for hours and hours, until we invariably upset Leena for making fun of her feet, a thing years later we’ll all regret.I’m sitting on the beach in Mombasa, eating mango and watching the sea where my dad learned to swim, ebb and flow, in and out of the bay.There are so many memories contained in that mango. For Mum, it was the one fruit that always reminded her of home. For Dad, it’s the only fruit he really eats. For me and my sister, it was the biggest treat when mum would come back from the Sunrup cash and carry with a box of six mangos, all hiding among the torn up strips of newspaper.I squeeze the mango until the skin breaks. I realise someone is staring at me, in disgust. She has just come out of the ticket office and noticed me, hiding in the corner, my hands, mouth and shirt, caked in orange flesh. She practically sprints away from me. My train is called and I run to get it. I still have the stone in my hand.The stone is the prize, my friends. This is the best bit of the mango. It’s the juiciest bit and your job is to suck it dry. My sister and I had to alternate who got the stone each night. Mum was the martyr, saying she would forego it for us to enjoy.I sit in the toilet of the train and suck the mango dry. I think of my daughter. The week before she had asked if we could make lassis. I showed her how to make them. All she was interested in was sucking the stone dry, like a vampire.I sit there, on the toilet of a train heading back to Bristol, thinking about all these things. Maybe mangos are my version of Proust’s madeleines. Most of my happy memories are mango adjacent. It’s a perfect 20 minutes of not thinking about anything else. And it’s exactly what I need.And now you know the best way, the only way, to eat a mango."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05aa39236e0f281d97153c1354b7053886f7bf5a/0_372_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ab9d0a8d03266103bcde8356014ae61","title":"trek powerfly a raft of next generation technology ebike review","story":"Vast offroading experience meets the best in modern ebikingTrek has decades of experience when it comes to MTBs and you can sense all that expertise in the trail-bike frame and suspension design of its bestselling Powerfly.

Russia 2018 is already well under way: another impossibly exciting, complex, wild-looking Fifa World Cup. And in its shadow, here we are too.Welcome to another mob-handed, obsessively planned, lovingly curated effort to bring you the  and Observer’s World Cup coverage in every conceivable form, to your every conceivable screen. This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business. Asking our readers to become subscribers, or to contribute to pay for something they value is, in our opinion, the best way forward. So if you like this stuff and think it’s worth helping it to continue, then why not make an additional contribution to the . It only takes a minute and can be as little as £1 if you’re particularly tight or shameless. Yes, sport can be seen as a glorious irrelevance, but it also says something about who we are. And hopefully our coverage makes you sound slightly less unintelligent than you are during a discussion of the reactive gegenpress in the local Wetherspoons. Perhaps it lights up your enjoyment via the frankly brilliant reporting of our football hacks, led of course (damn him) by annual award hoover Danny Taylor, and backed up by the likes of Dominic Fifield, Martha Kelner, Dave Hytner, Stuart James and, with the long range heavy artillery, the mind bogglingly good Marina Hyde. Perhaps you even enjoy reading the World Cup Fiver, following the multi award winning* daily World Cup blog, and listening to Max, Barry and star guests speak their brains over four increasingly hysterical weeks of World Cup Football Daily.

It will also open the Edinburgh international festival on 3 August.Can you describe Five Telegrams?It’s five short pieces about the first world war using a big-ass orchestra, young musicians, a choir and the spectacular, eye-boggling visuals of 59 Productions. It’s not soldier’s stories but the mechanics of how they communicated: codes, redaction, field postcards. Is it classical, is it pop? I don’t really think about it that way. There’s a beat, there’s a rhythm. Who cares about those distinctions any more? I use the same musical building blocks whatever kind of piece I make. There’s not such a panic to make categories. Radio 3 and 6 Music overlap in a way you’d never have imagined.It’s no surprise that concert programmes are still dominated by male composers. Surely we should be moving on? Are quotas essential, or irritating?It’s healthy to have the discussion. Things are changing. Weighting a programme towards greater female or sexual or racial ersity – composers, conductors, performers – has to be progress. We still need mechanisms for pushing us towards a more naturally balanced state. But that takes time to happen naturally and spontaneously. Yes, it’s annoying, I guess, to be told, when you get a job, “and it’s great you’re a woman”, but I’m glad they’re even thinking about it.Why hasn’t there been a #MeToo equivalent in classical on the scale of Hollywood?To be honest I don’t know. I don’t feel so aware because I’m mostly working on my own in a room. I’m not in an orchestra or circumstances where that might be more obvious. That said, I know musicians are sharing their stories on websites like shebangsthedrum.org. One reason – and maybe it sounds superficial – is that the key figures in classical music aren’t as well known, beyond a handful, as those in Hollywood, so the stories that have come out haven’t grabbed the headlines in the same way. You’ve said you didn’t “just want to be a composer”. Isn’t it enough?When I’m writing I’m on my own. I need to be pumped up, confident, mentally in the right place. I know what works for me. But I’ve discovered I need to perform too. I didn’t only want to write stuff down and have other people play it. There’s something very visceral about being part of a group of musicians, or in the middle of massive electronic sounds you’re creating. It’s a fist-clenching feeling. I love it.And now you wear a silver cape on stage?Yeah. My band have seamlessly transitioned from wearing classy black and gold to disgustingly unbreathable silvers. I found someone to make me a metallic-silver, pink-lined flouncy cape, like a Doctor Who reject. Then halfway through our shows I throw it off when it all gets too sweaty…Music and politics – oil and water?It’s down to the inidual. Some do it naturally – such as the issues regarding feminism and race within Beyoncé’s Lemonade, or Philip Venables with The Gender Agenda, where he engaged the audience via a game show. I am a feminist, but it’s never governed what I write. If someone said write a piece about the NHS, I’d support the issues, the principle, but I wouldn’t know how to set about it through my music. That said, I thought that about World War I and now I’ve done a big piece about it.Is classical music any worse now than in the past in its appeal – or not – to young people?It’s much easier to access than it ever was there’s a greater awareness. It’s less formal. Children are encouraged to use pieces – like the BBC’s Ten Pieces – as a starti ng point for art, dance, storytelling and less as a history lesson. Was there one thing that switched you on to music as a child?I wasn’t super fussed about any kind of music as a child. As a teenage clarinettist at my Edinburgh comp, it was a way of socialising: wind bands, orchestras. I loved honking my way through things like Swan Lake. The wind band was where you found your fellow geeks. Then I got interested in grunge, trashy 90s Ibiza anthems and pop. I loved the volume.You’ve had some amazing collaborators – fashion houses, Selfridges and M\u0026ampS a hospital scanning unit…I haven’t sought them out. I’m lucky they’ve come to me. I’m quite cautious about what I do. I like working with people from other art forms but I don’t look for influences. I tend to shut myself away. I did my first film (Eighth Grade) last year. That was a challenge. You don’t just present the music you want. You try to do what the film needs. That was a bit of a lesson for the ego. Not like Varmints, your 2016 debut album, where you were in charge of everything?Yes, I produced it. I was in total control of the electronics. Björk made a big statement a while back about women not being given credit for producing albums. In the pop world that basically means: who does the electronics. In my puppet-master control way there was no way I could let someone else come in and take control. I figured out the electronics using my classical software. That’s where my skills are. Notation. Some assumed this gnarly mix of bombastic instrumentals and wonky pop was me selling out and raking in the cash. Ha. But in truth, expensively, lavishly, I lobbed every penny I had at it. It’s a huge loss-making exercise and investment in a future you hope will happen – but it’s worth every second. Any dream collaborator in mind?Björk. I’m waiting by the phone.

In a statement issued on Saturday, Coveney reiterated the need for a permanent backstop for the Irish border, which would provide what Ireland sees as an “insurance policy” in the event of a change of government or a no-deal scenario.“Ireland’s position is that we want to see the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK. On the backstop for the border, our position remains clear. “While our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, a hard border will be avoided,” he said. He called on the UK to step up its efforts amid warnings that there were only weeks to the October deadline for a deal.“Time is short. I am in regular contact with Michel Barnier and my officials are working day in and day out with the taskforce team he leads,” he said.The British Irish Chamber of Commerce warned any attempt to strike a Brexit deal for goods only would be resisted by business leaders.The group’s director general, John McGrane, said that it would be a “fudge” and unworkable. “She is working very, very hard, moving millimetre by millimetre, and to say we could end up in some customs arrangement is a good thing.“But the whole point about trade is that it is not just goods. Goods do not exist in isolation. Services include the haulage sector, the creative sector, the tech sector – services simply cannot be left behind,” he said. He also said that a goods-only deal would not remove the need for an Irish border, with the issue of freedom of movement of people across the border impacting EU citizen employees, tourism and communities. The Democratic Unionist party, which threatened to torpedo May’s December deal over the border plan, has welcomed the proposal, describing it as a “reaffirmation of what is an absolute priority for us”, claiming it would be bad news for “republicans” who want to break up the United Kingdom. “It is clear the whole country will leave the EU together. Republicans may be disappointed as they tried their best to seize this as an opportunity to weaken the union,” said the DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds. Sinn Féin has argued for a special bespoke deal for Northern Ireland.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, gave the proposal a guarded welcome.She said it showed there was “more realism” and the plan was “hopefully a step forward”.However, she said the plan for a foot in the single market for goods and not for services sounded like the very “cherry-picking” the EU had rejected. But she said the softening of red lines meant it was “game on for those who would prefer to see a full single marketcustoms union outcome”.The statement on Friday night makes it clear that May believes the proposal for a free trade area on goods and agriculture will obviate the need for infrastructure and checks at the Irish border. It said the UK would be “honouring the letter and the spirit of the Belfast agreement” on peace signed 20 years ago and the deal would be so deep and comprehensive the “backstop” agreed in December would “not need to be brought into effect”. Brussels has made it clear from the outset that the backstop is mandatory and without it a withdrawal agreement cannot be struck or a transition period arranged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18dc5220ddd55c9ca1e31b775b45bddbcba6ae8/0_314_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c033916dfbcc7b0dc408be949c541582","title":"chris froome little sympathy boos tour de france","story":"Rider faces barrage of boos on Tour de France first stage while rivals bemoan lack of clarity over his adverse analytical findingTeam Sky have been here before at the Tour de France, and not just in the sense that the 2011 race started in the same region, the Vendée, that hosts this year’s Grand Départ. It is all familiar: the questions, the doubts, the innuendo, the attempts at spin-doctoring, the less than entirely warm welcome from the French public and press.It has become part of the furniture for the favourites at the Tour, to the extent that one French newspaper – justifiably – wondered on Saturday just how Chris Froome gets his head around it all. The team’s head, Sir Dave Brailsford, has spoken of the necessity for elite‑level sport to be an uncomfortable place to be – it keeps a team on its toes – and he has certainly achieved that with Team Sky, although in a way that has not been entirely intentional. But his close-knit band seem to thrive on the feeling that it is them against the world and there is no reason why it will not be that way yet again in the next few weeks.There was good reason to circle the wagons after the revelation on Monday that there would be no further proceedings in the case involving Froome’s high salbutamol reading at the 2017 Vuelta a España. As the team took to the stage at the pre-Tour presentation on Thursday night, in La Roche-sur-Yon, there were boos and catcalls and at least one anti-Froome poster brandished, in spite of calls for calm from voices ranging from the French favourite Romain Bardet to David Lappartient, president of the sport’s governing body, the UCI.There was limited sympathy from one rival at least: “We hope that people will avoid doing it,” said Nairo Quintana. “But sometimes you reap what you sow.” The booing, in the view of Lappartient, was a shame but related to cycling’s past and, he said, a lack of clarity: “When you don’t have clear answers, that’s always difficult.”Sky went on a PR offensive early in the week, with publication of information about Froome’s weight loss and diet regime on certain stages in the Giro d’Italia, including stage 19 to Bardonecchia, where he sealed his victory in the race. The information was termed fake news by the former Team Sky rider Richie Porte. The Australian added: “We’re all pros, we know how to fuel, we don’t need to read what Sky say they’re doing. We’ve been doing this long enough to know how to eat.”The irony of Froome calling for transparency will be lost on no one. There have been so many calls for Team Sky to tell the world about some affair or other over the years that there is an element of Groundhog Day about them. The argument has always been the same, that Sky can only benefit from transparency, given they have repeatedly committed to it, and given the 20 years of suspicion among the minds of cycling fans and media that have followed the Festina scandal of 1998.Most Tours since 2012 have included them making such appeals, the subjects different but all with the sport’s doping past as at least a subtext: the hiring of Dr Geert Leinders the team’s due diligence on Jonathan Tiernan-Locke, who tested positive for blood doping in the period before he joined Sky Froome’s cadence, Froome’s power output, therapeutic use exemptions, the parliamentary inquiry into the Jiffy bag affair.Froome was not the only one calling for more information on the case. “We’ve heard very little about the elements that led to the decision,” said Bardet, complaining of “a great opaqueness”.“It’s not very clear to everyone why he was cleared. We know there’s a full written verdict but we’ve not seen why, in detail,” added the 2014 Tour winner, Vincenzo Nibali, who felt there had been double standards applied compared with the case of his friend Diego Ulissi the UCI, in a press release on Friday, said it felt this was not the case.“If there’s someone to blame it’s not Froome, it’s the laxness of the rules,” said the Frenchman. “An adverse analytical finding, a positive test, this thing about thresholds – we don’t really know where we stand. That creates doubts and suspicions and I’m the first to regret that because cycling loses its credibility.”The stage is set for a game of pass the parcel with Wada, the UCI and Team Sky each claiming one of the others was responsible for making information public.The game took another turn on Friday when Lappartient stated he would be happy to publish the information but that it was dependent on Froome giving his permission. That, in turn, appeared to contradict the UCI’s own press release, stating that it understood why Wada would not release information and that it would put nothing more in the public domain.The final word on Froome should go to Nibali, who was asked by the veteran French writer Philippe Brunel for his feelings on the Froome verdict. The Italian replied that he would rather fight Froome than his shadow in other words, it is better to have Froome at the race with the affair settled than for him to be banned or awaiting the outcome. Any verdict was to be welcomed. A neat, complete ending will, as always in cycling, be harder to find."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cf0054f3ee58e25c9ef759e919560daa4c167aa/172_93_2127_1276/master/2127.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=723b7facab32bc5386640a6f44ae9578","title":"england katherine brunt local hero womens odi new zealand headingley","story":"England got the three-match series against New Zealand off to the perfect start with a 142-run win on Saturday, in the first women’s ODI to be staged at Headingley.Half-centuries from Amy Jones and Heather Knight at both ends of the England innings took the home side to 290 for five – their highest ODI total against New Zealand – after they won the toss and chose to bat first. In reply New Zealand slumped to 148 in 33.5 overs, Nat Sciver and Laura Marsh chiming in with three wickets apiece.Sciver, who was the player of the match for her contribution, which included 37 runs, said: “It was a pretty good performance all round. We knew we needed to get through that middle order and make sure we were always on top. We wanted to be clinical and ruthless and we were.”For New Zealand it was the same old story, the loss of Suzie Bates and Sophie Devine in consecutive overs sparking a collapse after the pair had taken the score to 50 without loss after the first 10.Both were lucky to last as long as they did, Bates surviving a big appeal for caught behind when on 13 and Sciver putting down an easy Devine catch at midwicket, both off the bowling of the unlucky Katie George on her ODI debut.George, though, got her name in the scorebook with a wonderful ing catch at mid-off from the bowling of Sciver to send Bates back to the pavilion, only six balls after an equally brilliant snaffle by Sophie Ecclestone in the same position to see off Devine. George also wrapped up England’s clinical bowling display, trapping Holly Huddleston lbw – the last wicket to go after New Zealand lost seven wickets for only 45 runs.England’s innings had got off to a flier as Jones and Tammy Beaumont put on 111 for the first wicket, the pair punishing some short, wayward bowling from the New Zealand pace attack. Of the two, Jones was dominant, reaching her first international half-century on home soil in 56 balls while Beaumont, playing second fiddle at the other end, still had only 25 to her name.Beaumont never looked quite at home at the crease, lucky to survive an lbw shout to the 17-year-old leg-spinner Amelia Kerr which would have been hitting middle stump when on 23, and her stay was ended when she top-edged a Lea Tahuhu bouncer to Katey Martin behind the stumps on 40.Kerr, whose figures of two for 36 from 10 overs were the pick of a bowling attack that otherwise leaked runs, then worked her magic to get rid of Jones, who had looked comfortably on course for a big score, as she was stumped coming down the pitch. Four overs later Sarah Taylor departed, bamboozled by Kerr’s googly for the second time in six days, leaving England on 148 for three. Kerr followed up by bowling the only maiden of the England innings.New Zealand failed to sustain the pressure, allowing Sciver and Katherine Brunt to score at a run-a-ball as both shared half-century stands with the captain Knight – 76 runs coming from the last 10 overs. Ultimately it was Brunt’s innings which received the heartiest cheers from the 2,100-strong crowd as the Barnsley bowler-turned-all rounder slogged her way to an unbeaten 30.“It was about building partnerships and making sure that we were there for a period of time, and still remaining positive with our intent to score,” Sciver said. “The wicket got a bit slow in the middle overs so we needed to manoeuvre the ball and test the field a little bit. It’s something we work on in the nets, so why not play it in the game?”The series continues at Derby on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9284fc89d84ed46eb391e718502d25eb66711a9b/340_381_1437_862/master/1437.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=009c439fadae379a77adc628bf320969","title":"lewis hamilton british f1 gp pole sebastian vettel","story":"If ever Lewis Hamilton needed a lift, it was here, in the cauldron of qualifying for the British Grand Prix. Pushed to produce one of his best ever laps to take pole from Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who will start second, the four-times world champion once again found inspiration from the huge crowd at Silverstone. They, in turn, were rewarded with an exceptional run that the Mercedes driver ranked as one of the most testing of his career.Nigel Mansell said the home crowd at the British Grand Prix was worth up to half a second a lap to him. The 1992 champion adored his home grand prix and its fans, as does Hamilton and they were out in force for him again. Basking in glorious sunshine at the old airfield, a world away from the inhospitable cold weather and winds that often sweep across the circuit, their enthusiasm was undimmed even by the tense anticipation of England’s imminent clash with Sweden.Hamilton had gone out to a campsite on Friday night to deliver 2,000 beers and 1,000 snack boxes at his own expense for the volunteer circuit marshals and helpers, a heartfelt gesture whose good intent was returned in spades – and just as well, he needed every possible encouragement to produce his very best.Hamilton took the pole with a track record time of 1min\u0026nbsp25.892sec in a final hot lap that was a tour de force around Silverstone but he was pushed to the limit by Vettel. The German was quickest on his first run in Q3, just five-hundredths of a second in front of Hamilton. Both laps were impressive but Vettel had the edge through the middle sector. But on the final runs Hamilton was extraordinary under immense pressure, threading the needle through Maggots and Becketts with precision, he finished four-hundredths ahead of Vettel, with Kimi Räikkönen in third and Valtteri Bottas in fourth.“It felt like one of the best laps I have been able to produce,” he said. “It felt like the most pressurised lap that I have ever had. I was shaking afterwards through the emotion and the adrenaline rush, way above what I have experienced before. Which is crazy as this is my 76th pole but this 76th is so special.”Mercedes had expected to be strong at the circuit, especially using the thinner-tread tyres that their car favours. They dominated on this Pirelli rubber in both Spain and France but Ferrari came at them with\u0026nbspvenom.Hamilton recognised this, although understandably he could not wait to escape the post qualifying press conference, his excitement visible when he received news of England’s first goal. “It took everything to get it,” he said. “The fans were there I could see them, and I knew they were there, I really wanted to do it and with the pole give a boost to England. Start the wave and let them continue it.” The football team did indeed carry on the day of sporting success.Having been frustrated at the last round with a DNF, his 14-point championship lead over Vettel became a one-point deficit to the German and he will be eager to once more top the table with a win on Sunday but is taking nothing for granted. “It’ll be demanding with the heat, the speed we have through corners, the G-force we are pulling,” he said. “I definitely think it will be physically tougher and more intense, it is not going to be a case of opening a big gap, it is going to be close all the way.”Thus far, however, it is the perfect start. He has matched Ayrton Senna’s record of six poles at his home grand prix and now has the chance to again enter the history books. If he can convert it into a win it will be his fifth consecutive victory at the British Grand Prix, surpassing Jim Clark’s run of four, and he will become only the second driver to have scored five wins in a row at the same track, matching Senna’s run at Monaco between 1989 and 1993. A sixth win at the British Grand Prix would also make him the most successful competitor at the race, with one more that Clark and Alain Prost.These details, though, will not concern him until the serious business is concluded. Hamilton has been enthusiastically following England’s progress in Russia and will go to Moscow should they make the final. Having been able to enjoy watching England’s win, he will now need to refocus on what is likely to be highly competitive race. A challenge awaits but one he can face buoyed by the enthusiasm that will doubtless be once again flowing from the grandstands.For the once-mighty British team Williams, who are enduring a shocking season, there was no respite at their home race with a car that still looks a handful. Lance Stroll went off at Brooklands in Q1, ending his session and he finished in 19th. While Sergey Sirotkin also went off at Stowe and although he continued, managed only 18th place.McLaren, who are also enduring the least successful period in their history, entered their home grand prix having announced a considerable restructuring after the resignation of their sporting director Eric Boullier on Tuesday but for the moment they are mired toward the back of the midfield with Fernando Alonso in 13th and Stoffel Vandoorne in 17th place.The Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo were fifth and sixth. Haas were once again the best of the rest with Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean in seventh and eighth respectively.

The\u0026nbspformer driver is well placed to judge. He has no little experience with both of them, racing\u0026nbspalongside\u0026nbspVettel at Red Bull for five years and against Hamilton\u0026nbspsince the Briton’s debut in 2007 until the Australian retired in 2013.Webber retains great affection for\u0026nbspthe British Grand Prix, reciprocated by the crowd at Silverstone who have shown huge admiration for the Australian, not least\u0026nbspon the occasion of his second\u0026nbspwin, in 2012. They roared their approval as he took the\u0026nbsplead from Fernando Alonso, wheel to wheel through Brooklands and cheered his run to the flag. “I\u0026nbsplove racing everywhere but here it’s extra special,” he said that day.“I won my first race here\u0026nbspin 1996 in Formula Ford, so the\u0026nbsplove affair continues.”He is back at the circuit that is celebrating the 70th anniversary of hosting its first grand prix in his capacity as a presenter for Channel 4, able to savour the event\u0026nbspand the fascinating fight between Hamilton and Vettel. “It’s\u0026nbsppretty epic,” he says. “The\u0026nbsprivalry\u0026nbspis absolutely there. You\u0026nbspcouldn’t have two more different characters. You have a calculating German and Lewis is just\u0026nbspan out-and-out racer.The battle between the two is finely poised, neither driver having been able to gain a distinct advantage thus far and there is no sign that either is yet in a position to establish any real dominance. Webber drove alongside Vettel when\u0026nbspthe German won his four titles between\u0026nbsp2010 and 2013 and believes\u0026nbspthe weight of the task falls heavier on him as he attempts to secure Ferrari’s first drivers’ championship since 2007.Vettel is having to push to the limit, Webber maintains. “He is carrying Ferrari, he is carrying the team and Italy. It is a fine line\u0026nbspbetween the White House and\u0026nbspthe shithouse,” he says.“This is the last nut to crack in many ways for him. The last two years it has just been him and Lewis. Ferrari and Mercedes. He is mindful that he has to beat a very, very strong team and when I talk about a team I mean Valtteri Bottas as well.“There is harmony, there is technical depth, and Mercedes are\u0026nbspbattle-hardened. Ferrari\u0026nbspare still a bit soft every now\u0026nbspand again. And Seb as well. We\u0026nbsphave seen a few little mistakes, he is going to need a perfect finish to the year to get the job done.”Webber came closest to winning the title in 2010, when he was in a four-way fight with Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and Vettel at the final round in Abu Dhabi, where the German ultimately took his first\u0026nbspchampionship.The Australian won eight races over his 11-year career, including the British Grand Prix twice. He vied\u0026nbspwith Hamilton repeatedly on track and believes the world champion is very much at the height of his\u0026nbsppowers.A tight battle is in the offing then, at a circuit where Webber is\u0026nbspalways happy to return. “Silverstone just has that feel of everyone being passionate about motorsport,” he says. “It’s a genuine love for the heroes in the cars. It is a classic, we are not talking about a little go kart-style track. Silverstone is high speed, it’s daunting. The\u0026nbspdrivers love coming here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d4c7144dead045fcc7eda91934d7179f922d0f1/0_359_5389_3234/master/5389.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc986e48f6b5fdfc2b5df8dfda20549f","title":"tour de france 2018 stage two live","story":"In case you didn’t see Chris Froome’s crash from yesterday, here is it from the view of the peloton. Some takeaways: It’s also coming home to La Roche-sur-Yon as the Tour finishes in the town for the first time since 1938. Belgium’s Eloi Meulenberg claimed the fifth of his seven stage wins there and it gives us an excuse to post this lovely footage.Here’s a nice graphic detailing the loop through the Vendée countryside.Bonjour. After yesterday’s quite bonkers Grand Départ, which did its level best to take focus away from events in Russia, the peloton will perhaps be hoping for a more sedate cycle through the Vendée countryside on the relatively flat 113 mile route from Mouilleron-Saint-Germain to La Roche-sur-Yon. Certainly Chris Froome will be hoping for a more reserved ride after his crash 2.5 miles from the finish which saw him lose 61 seconds to leader Fernando Gaviria and 51sec to many of his GC rivals. It was far from ideal given the controversial buildup leading into the race but as luck would have it, Nairo Quintana and Richie Porte also endured opening day stinkers. The Colombian, in particular, is a full 1:15 back following his mechanical issues. Countryman Gaviria, of course, gave the South Americans something to cheer with a brilliant victory on debut, out-sprinting Peter Sagan and Marcelo Kittel no less, to claim the Maillot jaune and today’s finish is expected to see a similar bunched sprint with a familiar set of names in contention. Sagan and Kittel will almost certainly be among them, while Frenchman Arnaud Démare will be fired up after a disappointing first stage in which he got caught up in a crash, denying him a shot at a second stage victory. Mark Cavendish has also been talking this stage up in his quest to reach the magic No34.Although it should be flat and fast, there are some nice little details to look out for that will test more than just power. There’s a single fourth-cat climb, 17 miles in, at Côte de Pouzauges which should encourage a breakaway, while the final section into La Roche-sur-Yon incorporates a roundabout with a 100 degree turn, several left and rights and then a 3 per cent gradient to the line. Look out for the time bonus available 8.5 miles from the finish as well.

Yet this advanced technology actually dates back to Victorian times when battery-powered horseless carriages shimmied around the streets of London and Paris. The first land speed record was set in 1898 by Count de Chasseloup-Laubat in an electrically driven Jeantaud – he briefly touched 39mph.If you have never driven an all-electric car before, it can take a while to get used to. The utter silence is unnerving. I am never sure if I have turned the car on or not. The moment you touch the throttle and it creeps forward always gives me a small jolt of panic. It feels as if you are rolling downhill with the handbrake off. Press the pedal harder and the instant torque and smooth acceleration is addictive. Electric motors don’t have gears, so the swoosh from 0-60 is completely seamless.Nissan has worked hard to make the Leaf so much more than simply a car with an electric motor. It is brimming with aids to make your ride safer, more connected and more effortless. The car has ProPilot, a suite of systems that deals with everything from traffic jams to keeping your distance on the motorway. It will steer for you, park for you and even bring you to an emergency stop. It’s autonomous driving as far as the law currently allows. Or you can switch off all the gadgetry and have fun driving it like an electric dodgem. The heavy floor-mounted battery creates a low centre of gravity so it corners with virtually no body roll.One thing which will throw you is its e-Pedal. Flick this button and you can drive the car with one pedal. You press the throttle as usual but remove your foot and the car applies automatic regenerative braking. The quicker you lift your foot the heavier the braking. The Leaf swept up dozens of awards the moment it was launched – all well deserved. But the true measure of its standing in the automotive world is that it in no way feels like a gimmicky electric car. It feels like a real car for the real world.

To celebrate this, each year the peninsula springs to life with music, colour and dancing, as creators from all over London come together for the Urban Village Fete. Curated by Wayne Hemingway, co-founder of Hemingway Design, the event delivers his vision of recreating the type of free festival that once attracted some of the brightest creative minds to Camden and Kensington markets.“Free festivals were the way we communicated,” he says. “There were loads of young designers who went on to become pretty famous. We want to recreate that in Greenwich: getting young creatives in front of tens of thousands of people at a price they can afford.”The fete is now in its fourth year and stretches through an area that is becoming a hub for design. Hemingway hopes that with 15,000 new homes, plus spaces designated for work and play, a sense of creativity and community will blossom on the peninsula, with creatives sharing the area with families. “The event feels generous, and generosity should be a part of urban life,” he says.Hemingway’s company produces dozens of festivals around the UK each year – from Liverpool’s Fine Tuned event to the National Festival of Making in Blackburn. One challenge facing market traders and craftspeople across these events is that shoppers are carrying less cash than ever. Hemingway Design and payments platform Square partnered to equip cash-only traders with Square Readers so they could take cards, many of them for the first time. Here, we meet some of the dozens of makers and creators who brought the Greenwich fete to life. Emily Griffin lives and breathes east London’s creative scene. A Hackney local for 20 years, during the past three she’s built her homewares and accessories business Mahala from the ground up. But while she makes and designs most of what can be found inside her store, the brand is also a family affair. “My husband joined Mahala a year ago and designs the clothes, which we have made in Bow,” says Griffin. “His aunt has a small orchard, so she makes all the lovely oils for us.” Mahala’s clothes and accessories are made to endure, reflecting the family’s thrifty past. Griffin uses military canvas and saddlery to create her bags, and her designs are centred around slow fashion. “I want people to have them for a really long time. I always repair stuff – I’d rather repair than replace,” she says.Building relationships with her customers at events such as the Urban Village Fete is key. “It means we’re not relying on footfall on our street, which is really quiet. Plus, we get to meet people from all over London and farther afield,” she says. The concrete planters found at From the Land (formerly Conpot) are far from the rigid grey slabs the material usually brings to mind. Architect Alastair Mitchell and textile designer Kezia Regan began experimenting in their home with planters made from concrete, before expanding to homewares and surfaces. “Each one uses a different stone source from around the country – Shropshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire – so we’re trying to show that concrete can have all these regional dialects,” says Mitchell.As the business grows, he says the aim is to move away from third-party retailers and sell more through his online store and specialist ceramic fairs, and at events like the Urban Village Fete. To do this, and to make the most of footfall, he has started using cashless payment platform Square. “If you only take cash, most people go away and never come back,” he says. “Just the other day we had someone come to our house who wanted to buy a planter. We were able to take a card payment in our living room.”Sarah Harvey, UK lead for Square, says: “None of us want to have to walk away from a unique item on a market stall just because that trader won’t accept cards, and with our partnership we wanted to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to support independent and creative businesses.” Ayse Özden loves creating with paper. She is one of the founders of WeAct, a London-based stationery store and brand agency with its roots in Turkey. “Greeting cards are a very big thing in Europe, whereas in Istanbul they’re not,” she says. Her family made the move to bring their collections to London two years ago. Her stall at the Urban Village Fete was filled with quirky designs from dictionary clippings underlying colourful illustrations designed by her husband to comical faces splashed across greeting cards and notebook covers. “There’s been a really nice response to the face collection,” she says. “Lots of people are laughing and that was our aim – to help people have fun.” Before making bespoke, one-of-a-kind bags to sell exclusively at markets, Anna P was designing 250-piece collections twice a year for high-street stores. Now she works for herself, and has spent three years collecting vintage textiles that she uses to design and make leather and cloth bags by hand. The designer prefers to sell to people direct, and doesn’t have an online store. Because of the nomadic nature of her stall, she makes sure she has a cashless payment system whenever she’s selling at markets. “I use Square and it’s so quick to take payments – if you have a lot of people and they all want to buy at the same time, just tap it on there and it’s done,” she says.  The bright pops of colour coming from the Keeler \u0026amp Sidaway stall captured the Urban Village Fete’s sunny, holiday vibes. Joe Keeler began his print and stationery company two years ago, as a way of combining his loves of illustration, photography and travelling – the latter of which inspires his art, which often features Californian poolsides and graphic beaches.“I’m an avid photographer, so I’ll take loads of photos and come back and draw from them, or sketch scenes while I’m on location and then work it all together from there,” he says.With a studio based in Bermondsey, Keeler sells his prints through his online store, but makes an exception when it comes to the urban village fete. “This one is the best summery festival things to do in London,” he says. “There are lots of people here.” Visitors to Imogen Johnson-Gilbert’s stall could try on her first collection, made at a Fairtrade factory in Bangalore, a new milestone for her business. Previously, Johnson-Gilbert made all of the Gillian June clothes herself, but the business’s popularity has made that tricky. “We’ve grown to a point where I’ve stopped being able to make it all,” she says.  Isabelle Laight really loves hip-hop, and at the Urban Village Fete she found she was in good company. “You can see everyone being really surprised when they walk past. It’s one of those things you don’t see that often,” she says of her illustrated designs of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB greats on the sides of mugs, plates, and stationery. “Kanye is the most popular. I don’t want him to be, but he is,” says Laight. “My favourite at the moment is Tupac – I’m going through a bit of a phase.” Using Square for payments at the fete, Laight says: “It’s really easy, I just keep it in my pocket, and there’s been no need to troubleshoot because I haven’t had any problems.” Sheffield native Alastair Mason knows a thing or two about pork. “It’s always been a family tradition that we have our pork brined or dipped by the butcher,” he says of his favourite snack. Mason started the Salty Loins food truck in 2015 through sheer frustration: he was unable to get a “decent” pork sandwich in London. “After raving to my friends about not being able to find this kind of pork, I decided to take it upon myself to experiment and came up with my own brine recipe.”Since then, the trained graphic designer has been a staple at London markets such as Maltby Street and Borough, as well as on the Bermondsey “beer mile”. Mason’s menu has expanded to incorporate one of his hometown’s favourite dishes – chips and gravy – plus baby back salt ribs, which he cooks up in front of hungry punters. “It’s good theatre when you’ve got a street food stall, obviously. That and the smell is key to people coming in and trying something new,” he says.Cathryn Quail’s stall on the peninsula looked straight out of the pages of a trendy interiors magazine – but she wants plants to be a part of a sustainable lifestyle rather than feeding an expensive trend. She opened The Botanical Workshop last September to sell plants and teach people how to arrange and take care of them. “It should be something that is affordable, that brings you joy and helps with mindfulness,” she says. “When you buy plants and they stay alive, it’s way more sustainable.”To curb the frustration generated by his bureaucratic job, where he was stuck at a desk each day, Ross Mitchell started curing food. Over three years, his hobby grew to become a business, now called Smoke and Cure. This was his first gig at the Urban Village Fete. “It is always good to meet a new bunch of customers. We were sitting right next to the music stage and among other peer businesses, so we were in good company,” he says.Mitchell has also learned that catering for card payments is now a necessity. “A year ago I wasn’t too fussed about using them, but what I found is it absolutely opens up a whole new line of business,” he says. “With Square you’re allowed to take payment over the phone, which is becoming increasingly important for our particular business.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea4f1dc1d4e63cc78e4ee6b5ea817859b12c22f0/513_134_4669_2802/master/4669.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f77fecaccbe095be17594bb040eb7660","title":"fray bentos uruguay not just a meat pie","story":"The sleepy town was once home to the food brand that began in 1863 and the industrial landscape is now a world heritage siteIf you are lucky enough to reach the tiny Uruguayan town of Carmelo on a summer evening, you can cycle through tranquil vineyards, past lavender bushes and a yellow chapel glowing in the fading sunset to the Italian social club for dinner. Founded in the 1930s, very little has changed since then. Lo Korrea still serves the cheap, hearty food Italian farmers devoured after a day harvesting grapes on Saturday nights and sometimes Sunday lunch. The food is unrepentantly old-fashioned, heavy in cream and sugar, and the prices are, too – just under £12 for wine and three courses. On the evening we went there was a 60th wedding anniversary, with music seeping through a wall into the annex where we ate, and the odd child in a suit or frilly dress, eyes wide with sugar and excitement, wandering through the door.We ended up in Carmelo on our way to somewhere else even more improbable. Fray Bentos. Many people who recognise the name are astonished to find out that it is really a town, as opposed to the British brand of canned meat products, originally corned beef and then ready-made pies. It’s actually both. The sleepy, charming riverside town in Uruguay, was also home to the Fray Bentos brand which began in 1863 in a sprawling factory. In its heyday this cathedral of the industrial age, built along the town’s lush riverbank, fed half the world, churning out corned and frozen beef to fuel wars and the rise of empires. It played such a role in the transformation of how we eat worldwide, bringing meals into the industrial era, that three years ago Unesco declared the abandoned and ruined complex a world heritage site.When my Uruguayan godmother told me Fray Bentos was a place, not just a pie brand, we decided we had to visit this forgotten icon. The production lines have long since closed, the docks are decaying and it has fallen back into sleepy silence, disturbed only by tourists drawn to its strange and striking heritage. It is an unlikely holiday spot but a rewarding one, the quirky colonial charm of the town a perfect counterpoint to the stark remains of the factory, and if you tire of history there are beaches, ranches and one of Uruguay’s most unusual and relaxing wine areas just a short drive away.According to local legend, Fray Bentos was named after a shepherd who pointed travellers on their way. His legacy has been picked up by the locals who guide visitors through the sprawling factory complex, paved with iron to withstand the weight of thousands of cattle. There is a strange beauty in parts, particularly the turbine hall. A checkerboard marble floor (the stone was chosen in the 1920s for insulation), vast wheels arching towards the vaulted ceiling, frozen by time and rust, and sunbeams picking out the dust motes in the silent air give it something of the feel of an abandoned temple.There is even an inner sanctum, a control room of practical luxury, panels adorned with intricate metal-work and more marble, where engineers tended to the mysteries that kept the wheels turning. The plant was founded by a German inventor whose “meat extract” a liquid precursor to Oxo, needed vast quantities of beef, so he came to Uruguay where cows were plentiful and cheap. In the 1920s a British company bought the firm, giving it its local nickname, El Anglo. The town’s name became a byword for corned beef. Meat from Fray Bentos fed troops in both world wars, and British troops even nicknamed one tank Fray Bentos, a dark joke about a crew that were little more than minced meat in a can.A small museum tells the plant’s history and features curiosities such as a two-headed calf and Uruguay’s first lightbulb. When the tour finishes you can mull over the cycles of wealth and decline that played out here, the dawn of globalisation before the word was even coined, over lunch at La Chimenea, on a riverside terrace built over the plant’s former water pumping station, with a view clear across to Argentina. Inside, wood burns to charcoal in a hearth several metres wide, to grill the parrillada (barbecue) of perfectly seared meats (and a few vegetables if you insist) – a Uruguayan national passion. The owners are so friendly that when we found out they didn’t take cards, and we didn’t have enough cash, they told us just to put an envelope under the door later. It only serves lunch though, so save dinner for the town, a separate world from the factory complex with its villas, Anglo-Germanic sense of order, and probably the world’s only town-square monument to corned beef.Wealth seeped over into Fray Bentos, so the streets are adorned with strange and charming curiosities, such as the bandstand in the central square which is a copy of the one in Crystal Palace, a lavishly decorated theatre and rows of grand colonial homes, with high barred windows hiding inner courtyards from curious passersby. One has been turned into a hotel, the Posada del Frayle Bentos, whose sense of history has more or less survived a slightly brutal modernisation, with the addition of a plunge pool which offers a welcome chance to cool off on summer days. Locals stroll around to relax, or drive excruciatingly slowly up and down the riverfront. “It’s a small town – if we drove fast we’d be at the other end too quickly,” one explained.You can get a simple dinner and a drink with a view at Cervecería Hoffman. Save dessert for ice-creams at Heladeria Deleite, where they have five or six variations on dulce de leche – the creamy caramel that is a national obsession. If you fancy some exercise after that, there is a nine-hole golf course designed for El Anglo executives by the famous course architect Alister MacKenzie and recently refurbished for the top brass of a new factory complex upriver. Its open to visitors, although don’t expect golf carts or Trumpian flourishes of luxury.We had come to Fray Bentos through Carmelo, the most northern terminal for ferries from Buenos Aires, and somewhere else with a delicious sense of forgotten time and place. The streets were as empty as a town in a Gabriel García Márquez novel, during siesta, or after a cataclysm. The old wine district of Colonia Estrella is just 15 minutes by bike from Carmelo, across pancake-flat fields and empty roads, where we stayed at a lodge and boutique winery, Campo Tinto. The star grape in the region is an unusual variety called tannat, which grows well in Uruguayan soil and has become the country’s calling card, like Malbec for neighbouring Argentina. Campo Tinto also has a viognier and a special Uruguayan blend – medio y medio – a kind of sparkling semi-sweet rosé, a tribute to a cocktail popular with port workers in Montevideo and perfect for summer afternoons.• Most of the hotels in Carmelo offer bicycles with the room, or rent them out for a nominal fee, and it is a wonderful place to cycle, almost pancake flat, with wide, largely empty roads.• Cars can be rented from Marino Sport, who are very flexible on pick up and drop-off locations, and will come to you for a small fee.• Or there are buses from Carmelo to Fray Bentos twice daily. Book here.• Most of Fray Bentos is walkable, or the hotel can help you find taxis. • Entrevinas is a romantic cabin for two, set among the Bodega Cordana vineyards in the mornings breakfast will be left in a basket on the porch, otherwise you will be undisturbed.• Campo Tinto has an excellent restaurant and small swimming pool to enjoy, along with the wines.Fly to Buenos Aires with British Airways or Iberia, then get a ferry to Carmelo with Cacciola Viajes.

Best of all, it’s delightfully unhurried and free of overhyped hotspotsThe Peloponnese, southern Greece’s much-mythologised peninsula, has something of a reputation for philoxenia – the tradition of giving a warm welcome and showing generous hospitality to visitors. It’s also a region that embodies the very ideal of slow travel: local food and drink, plenty of walking, zero stress, tapping ancient rhythms and community spirit.Of course, this comes from the people. But it may also have to do with vital statistics. The peninsula is about the size of Wales, yet receives only a small percentage of tourists in comparison to the big beasts of Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Halkidiki and others. This means there’s no need to jostle among crowds.A topography of indented coasts, river valleys, steep mountain ranges and small coastal peninsulas encourages rural integrity over road-building. In hundreds of small villages, local ties are strong, there are festivals aplenty, and life revolves around farming and fishing, family and friends – and, naturally, local tavernas.Even the staples are sybaritic, from the famous Kalamata olives and green-gold oil to purple-hued tsakoniki aubergines to barrel-aged feta cheese. Wine grapes have been grown across the sun-baked slopes for centuries.For all its old-world charm, the Peloponnese is also a land of almost unlimited scope for exploration. It’s home to some of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, including Olympia and Ancient Messini, as well as many others lesser-known but no less enthralling. Much of Greece’s mythology originated here, including the main players of the Trojan wars.If you want relaxation, this unique part of Greece delivers in spades. Get the inside track on the must-visit villages, beaches and beauty spots, for the ultimate go-slow break in the Peloponnese ...Mani, the second finger at the southern tip of the Peloponnese and, by extension, mainland Greece itself, is one of the most beautiful regions in the country, with a mountainous spine running down to what were – until relatively recently – some very remote spots. The sun rises late on the coast because of the high Taygetos mountain range. Mornings tend to be lazy affairs where locals and visitors mingle to enjoy leisurely coffees and late breakfasts.It is also home to the pretty town of Kardamili. This laid-back little place is wonderful for walkers planning to hike the Viros gorge ditto for birdwatchers, artists and writers – little wonder that Patrick Leigh Fermor chose this village to be his home. The small beach resort of Stoupa is just a few miles to the south.Eat and drinkAll the local eateries are traditional family-run tavernas – as authentic a Greek culinary experience as you’ll find anywhere.  Kiki’s Taverna, up a side street from the town square, does dishes of the day rather than a set menu – favourites include sea bream and goat’s meat – ensuring produce is fresh and seasonal. It’s really traditional and popular with locals. If you want a stunning view with your meal, try Dioskouri Taverna, which overlooks the little harbour of Kardamili, for a fresh fish and sunset combination. It also sells local sea salt, olive soap and honey.StayThe Liakoto and Anniska hotels are on the sea front with the Taygetos range behind – Kardamili is blessed by both sea and mountain scenery. Anniska has a more traditional look and feel, with a stunning terrace where breakfast is served and drinks flow all day. Liakoto has sea-view rooms with private balconies overlooking the magnificent Messinian Bay. Both hotels have a very high number of repeat guests.This away-from-it-all haven is at the start of a string of fine, sandy beaches, culminating in the fantastic lagoon-like curve of Voidokilia in the heart of the nature reserve here – with wetlands excellent for birding.

Pyongyang, however, made clear it had no intention of carrying out the comprehensive unilateral disarmament Donald Trump has claimed was the outcome of his 12 June summit in Singapore with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.In rebuffing the US approach to talks, the regime laid out its most detailed negotiating position to date, suggesting confidence-building measures each side could take, including a proposal to freeze production of intercontinental ballistic missiles and a call for a formal declaration ending the Korean war of 65 years ago.A long detailed statement from the North Korean foreign ministry on Saturday gave an assessment of the past two days of talks between US and North Korean delegations in Pyongyang, describing them as “regrettable”. The statement flatly contradicted the upbeat assessment from Pompeo, who headed the US delegation. On leaving Pyongyang for Tokyo, Pompeo had said the two delegations had made progress on “almost all the central issues” and that on some issues there was “a great deal of progress”. Speaking later in Tokyo alongside Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers, Pompeo insisted the Pyongyang regime had accepted it would have to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme entirely.“From weapons systems, to fissile material, to production facilities, it’s a broad definition of denuclearisation and they have not challenged that,” he said. Asked how he could think the North Koreans had been negotiating in good faith, Pompeo replied “Because they were.”The North Korean foreign ministry statement, by contrast, adopted a wounded tone, saying hopes of progress raised by the Singapore summit between Kim Jong-un and Trump, had been dashed by the one-sided approach taken by Pompeo’s delegation.In particular, the statement to took the Americans to task for insisting on complete, verifiable, irreversible disarmament (CVID).“The US side came up only with its unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearisation just calling for CVID, declaration and verification, all of which run counter to the spirit of the Singapore summit meeting and talks,” the statement said.It also complained that Pompeo’s team never mentioned “a peace regime on the Korean peninsula”, which for Pyongyang involves scaling back the US military commitment to South Korea, and the formal declaration of peace.“It seems that the US misunderstood our goodwill and patience. The US is fatally mistaken if it went to the extent of regarding that the DPRK would be compelled to accept, out of its patience, the demands reflecting its gangster-like mindset.”Pointedly, the foreign ministry said “We still cherish our good faith in President Trump”, suggesting that the “headwinds” to progress were being created by others.If the talks failed, it warned “this will finally make each side seek for another choice and there is no guarantee that this will not result into yet another tragedy”.Pompeo met the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, on Sunday, to brief him on the Pyongyang talks. Speaking at the start of the meeting at his Tokyo residence, Abe paid tribute to the “strong leadership” Pompeo had demonstrated in Pyongyang.“This really shows the unwavering bond of the Japan-US alliance,” the prime minister said. Pompeo later restated the US position that sanctions would remain in place until “final” North Korean denuclearisation had been carried out.The Pyongyang talks, however, appeared to have exposed a wide gap between the way the Trump administration and Pyongyang interpreted the outcome of the Singapore summit. In a joint statement with Trump, Kim committed his regime to move towards “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”.Trump took it to mean total and unilateral nuclear disarmament. He returned to the US claiming North Korea was “no longer a nuclear threat”. Last week in Montana, he told a crowd: “But we signed a wonderful paper saying they’re going to denuclearise their whole thing. It’s going to all happen.”However, since 1992, the regime has used the phrase, “complete denuclearisation” to mean a drawn out, phased process of mutual demilitarisation of the peninsula.In Singapore, Trump and Kim also agreed verbally on mutual confidence-building measures, in which Trump would suspend military exercises with South Korea, while Kim would dismantle a missile engine testing site and repatriate the remains of some US soldiers killed in the Korean war.Trump immediately ordered the suspension of what he called US-South Korea “war games”, dismissing them as too expensive. However, Pyongyang has yet to deliver on its side of the bargain – destroying the test site and sending back the soldiers’ remains.Saturday’s foreign ministry statement lays out an expanded North Korean version of what mutual confidence-building measures would look like.It said Pyongyang would dismantle the “high thrust engine” testing site as a concrete measure towards “the suspension of ICBM production as part of denuclearisation steps” while making a start of “working level talks” on repatriation of remains.In return the US would make “public a declaration on the end of war” on the 65th anniversary of the Korean war armistice, which falls on 27 July.It remains unclear how Trump will respond to the withering North Korean rhetoric. So far he has ignored suggestions that he achieved little of substance in Singapore.Colin Kahl, former national security advisor to vice-president Joe Biden, assessed the latest developments in a tweet.“The good news: If diplomacy continues to stall, Trump will probably not go back on the war path because that would require him to admit he got suckered by Kim,” Kahl said. “The bad news: He got suckered by Kim.”Soon afterwards, Susan Rice, who was national security advisor to Barack Obama, replied on Twitter.“No, Colin, once he realises he got suckered, he will go on the war path to try to prove his manhood. He will manufacture some excuse other than his own gullibility,” Rice said. “This will get dicey again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cda89e0dd16e1c2c5ba04f6d65cbca75c74b540/0_74_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bc064dd5e88d92b81b0bcd2e061d7b8","title":"indian book cafe men serving life sentences shimla","story":"The Book Cafe in Shimla helps prisoners convicted of violent crimes stay part of societyBy day, from the cafe in Shimla where he works, Jai Chand enjoys one of the city’s best views of the Indian Himalayas. In the evenings, his view is one of the worst.For 11 hours a day, the staff at the Book Cafe serve coffee and food to a stream of customers. Then they lock up and walk the 15 minutes back to prison.Chand, 48, and his colleagues are all convicted criminals serving life sentences. They have been running the cafe since April 2017, as part of an initiative to help prisoners maintain a connection to society and earn money to support their families.No prison officers are in sight as the men count money, prepare food and contend with the afternoon rush of children in school uniforms. Each staff member qualified for the programme by demonstrating years of good behaviour behind bars.“For the last two years there has not been even a single complaint from anybody,” says Sanjay Chauhan, the former mayor of Shimla, who established the scheme during his term. The programme is considered a success, but one night last week the cafe was burgled. Of course, Chand and the staff had alibis.The cafe is one of a range of operations being run by prisoners in Himachal Pradesh state, including mobile food vans, online supermarkets and theatrical shows performed to the public. “If somebody has done a crime, it doesn’t mean they are a criminal for ever,” Chauhan says. “We have to give them an opportunity to be decent men also, and earn for their families.”Once the crowd of customers clears, Chand explains how he ended up in prison. “Section 302 of the Indian penal code,” he says. Murder.Seventeen years ago, Chand claims he arrived home to find his wife attempting suicide. He tried to save her, he says. But the police believed otherwise, accusing him of drowning and then strangling her, and a court concurred. Chand was sentenced to life in prison. Only a laminated government notice announces the cafe as any different to the others on the street. Many customers are not aware that the men behind the counter are serving time for violent crimes the ones who do know are unconcerned.“The staff here are very humble,” says Puneet Sharma, a regular customer. “People are happy, they are supporting this.”Mohit Chauhan is surprised to learn who has been serving him coffee for the past few months, but shrugs. “I’m happy people are getting the opportunity to work,” he says.For Chand, it is more than just a job. “When I was in prison, we weren’t a part of society – we were isolated,” he says. “When I’m here I feel like part of society. I matter, I’m human.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/809417b64e8b2fcb902cbcace17efdca643d59c2/7_510_3913_2349/master/3913.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71f38f1c665d5ccc86af82144824a2ad","title":"pride in london in pictures","story":"Huge crowds enjoy the sun and the parade at the city’s annual LGBT Pride celebration."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3556754.1530900213!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"heatwave nostalgia ireland s sizzling summer of 1976","story":"In time, young people of today will look back and talk about “the summer of 2018” in the same way that an older generation has been reminiscing about the summer of 1976.Back then, the heatwave in Ireland and the UK happened in June, not July: beer and lager went into short supply, chocolate melted and sharks came closer than ever before to beaches.Temperatures in Offaly hit 32.5 degrees in Boora on June 29th , making it the hottest June day on record – although Ireland’s record remains the 33.3 degrees recorded at Kilkenny Castle on June 26th, 1887. By the time it ended, the three-month heatwave had caused the worst drought in 150 years, while the temperature recorded in Boora on July 29th marked the fifth day in a row when the mercury had breached 32 degrees.The summer drought was heightened by the lack of rainfall during the previous two winters, which placed extraordinary demands on supplies and led to restrictions being put in place a year later to rebuild stocks.Reporting on the heatwave, The  noted the changes in people’s habits that began to be noticed throughout June, as people grew more accustomed to the new Mediterranean climate. In Ireland, on June 29th, people mulled buying shutters for windows to let the air in, and keep the sun out as temperatures hit 27.5 degrees in the Midlands and 26 degrees at Armagh Observatory – the warmest June day there since 1870. Despite the endless sunshine, RTÉ’s Colm Connolly reported the concerns on July 2nd of a consultant dermatologist about people who were taking photo-sensitising drugs to boost tanning speeds.Meanwhile, drought-sensitive beech trees suffered badly, and the growth of many of them in Ireland and the UK still showed after-effects three decades later, though ones in the UK suffered worst.Sales on electric fans continued to rise while some families opted to stay indoors completely and cool off in “tepid baths”, though the authorities urged people to keep levels below five inches.Meanwhile, The  pondered about the effects of the heatwave on men’s sexual interest, fearing that the high temperatures were causing “a love drought”. “It seems the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak when temperatures soar into the 80 and 90s,” the newspaper reported, before interviewing a clinical psychologist who explained that men still felt “sexually aroused but don’t feel inclined to initiate any activity”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"PSNI says children assaulted officers and attacked property with petrol bombsLocal group frustrated as council breaches own development plan to grant planningResident says: \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom just horrified and disgusted.

Photograph: Reuters With Ireland’s exceptional warm spell showing no sign of abating and no significant let up in the drought expected for at least 15 days, Irish Water is examining options for more extensive water restrictions if required.According to Met Éireann, mainly dry, warm weather will continue this weekend and until Thursday at least, while forecaster Evelyn Cusack said predictions are for the dry spell to continue for another ten days - and possibly up to 15 days.Temperatures this weekend will range up to 26 degrees on Saturday and 28 degrees on Sunday. Ireland offically entered a drought on Thursday following 15 days without rain.Given the low-moisture content in soil following weeks without rain forecasters predict at least one week of sustained rainfall is necessary before water levels in lakes, rivers and reservoirs start to recover.An Irish Water spokeswoman said the possibility of no rain falling in the near future could lead to restrictions, which include a national hosepipe ban and night-time pressure reductions,\u0026nbspbeing extended to the commercial sector with bans on washing down premises.If these measures also proved insufficient then Irish Water would have to consider wider reductions in water pressure.The utility could theoretically ban all non essential usage, including watering can usage, window washing and watering of sports pitches.Irish Water’s helpline has received less than 40 reports of people defying the domestic hosepipe by Thursday last, the evening before the Dublin based ban was extended to all areas. The spokeswoman said further analysis of the reports would be available over coming days.Defying the ban can attract a fine of up to €125, but the spokeswoman said the majority of calls have been from people seeking clarification or advice on restrictions and outages. She said people could see the effects of the water shortage in the burnt grass and most people were behaving responsibly.Speaking on RTÉ’s Prime Time during the week Met Éireann’s Ms Cusack said: “Our predictions are certainly another ten days which is the medium range of our forecast but we’re currently using an experimental 15 day forecast and that is indicating a lot of dry weather.“It’s been exceptionally dry. It’s been the driest June in Leinster since 1941. “These conditions will remain for another week to two weeks. It’s not only been exceptionally dry but also exceptionally sunny and that’s because the weather has been coming down from the north.”Meanwhile Irish Water has been notified of a number of ongoing leaks in Dublin City Centre in which water is flowing down the road.On Friday as the State-wide hosepipe ban came into effect water could be seen flowing down the road in front of Leinster House on Kildare Street.Irish Water has also acknowledged a report of a leak at Glover’s Lane, beside the entrance to St Stephen’s Green Car Park which has been pouring water into the street since mid June.It is understood that Irish water would have to close the road to fix the leak, leading to access issues for the centre and local business."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3557877.1530971951!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and may speak after pm secures approval for soft brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar meeting with British prime minister Theresa May in June.

While our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, a hard border will be avoided.Mr Coveney said talks needed to be intensified.“Time is short. I am in regular contact with Michel Barnier and my officials are working day-in and day-out with the Task Force team he leads. Our entire focus now is on ensuring a Withdrawal Agreement, including the Irish backstop, is agreed. This will give businesses across our islands certainty in terms of planning for a status-quo transition when the UK leaves the Union in March 2019,” he said.Mr Coveney said the UK statement needed “detailed consideration” and looked forward to the additional details the White Paper would give.Negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal agreement with the EU have been deadlocked on the issue of the Border backstop, with Brussels saying it must apply only to the North and London calling for a UK-wide solution to avoid creating barriers within the UK.In a statement issued late on Friday, the Irish Government said that EU ministers would consider the UK proposals at a meeting in Brussels on July 20th.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Reuters US secretary of state Mike Pompeo brushed off North Korean accusations of “gangster-like” diplomacy during negotiations in Pyongyang, saying on Sunday he will pursue denuclearisation talks after meeting his Japanese and South Korean counterparts.Mr Pompeo said in Tokyo there was still a lot of work to do but he was confident North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would stick to a commitment to abandon nuclear weapons that he made during a summit with US president Donald Trump in Singapore last month.Mr Pompeo’s meeting with Japan’s minister of foreign affairs Taro Kono and South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha followed two days of talks in Pyongyang that ended on Saturday.“When we spoke to them about denuclearisation, they did not push back,” Mr Pompeo told a news conference. “The road ahead will be difficult and challenging and we know that critics will try to minimise the work that we’ve achieved.”Mr Pompeo spoke after North Korea said the two days of talks with America’s top diplomat “brought us in a dangerous situation where we may be shaken in our unshakable will for denuclearization, rather than consolidating trust between the DPRK and the US”.The statement, which referred to the North’s formal name of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), was carried by the official KCNA news agency on Saturday soon after Mr Pompeo left Pyongyang.Mr Kim made a broad commitment in Singapore to “work toward denuclearization” but did not give details on how or when he would dismantle North Korea’s nuclear programme. Mr Trump in turn offered security guarantees to Pyongyang and pledged a halt to large-scale military drills with South Korea. North Korea’s latest comments, which came after Mr Pompeo said talks had made progress, are a reminder of the difficulties that previous US administrations have had negotiating with the reclusive Stalinist state and suggest that Pyongyang may not agree to any rapid denuclearisation.Leaked US intelligence findings concluded that North Korea does not intend to give up its nuclear programme completely.Mr Trump has vowed that North Korea will not be allowed to threaten the United States with its ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. His meeting with Kim in Singapore came after months of often bitter rhetoric and threats.Mr Pompeo said he did not meet Mr Kim on his latest visit to Pyongyang, as he had done twice before.Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Twitter there was a danger military action could be called for because Mr Trump might now claim he had tried diplomacy but was betrayed by Mr Kim.“But a rushed summit and demands that NK denuclearize in short order or else is not a serious test of diplomacy,” Mr Haass tweeted.Japan’s Mr Kono thanked Mr Pompeo and said the three allies had reaffirmed a commitment to keeping sanctions on North Korea until it abandoned nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles of all ranges.“We confirmed that security assurances will be provided to North Korea as agreed in the summit. At the same time we have reaffirmed that the international community will continue to fully implement relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” Mr Kono said.Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe earlier praised Mr Pompeo at his residence in Tokyo.“I would like to pay my tribute to the strong leadership you have demonstrated in negotiating with North Korea,” Mr Abe told Mr Pompeo. “This really shows the unwavering bond of the Japan-US alliance.”South Korea’s Ms Kang also lauded Mr Pompeo and said her country did not believe the United States had weakened its demands on Pyongyang.“Secretary Pompeo’s visit to Pyongyang this time has taken the first steps,” she said. “We expect this to be followed up by further constructive and productive negotiations.”Mr Pompeo said before leaving for Pyongyang he was seeking to “fill in” details on North Korea’s commitments and maintain the momentum towards implementing the Singapore agreement between Mr Trump and Mr Kim.US intelligence officials earlier told Reuters Mr Pompeo wanted to agree on at least an initial list of nuclear sites and an inventory that could be checked against available intelligence. -

This is the latest humiliation, said one person on the list.Presenters are resigned to the fact that the BBC has effectively launched a National Trolling Festival where we all get pummelled over our salaries. Everyone is totally exasperated and fed up about it, managers and presenters.Transparency will effectively lead to a rate card where they \u0027pay the chair\u0027 instead of the presenter.Another broadcaster resigned to the disclosures said: Of course I\u0027d rather the world didn\u0027t know how much I get paid. It\u0027s very un-British, isn\u0027t it? But this is where we are now.Others believe it is a positive change. Look, if you\u0027re earning over £150,000, just shut up about any \u0027humiliation\u0027. Total transparency is key, said one.However, the list will be a long way from total transparency. Around one-third of the names disclosed last year will no longer be present - not because they have had their pay cut, but because their programmes are made by BBC Studios, which was spun off as a commercial entity at the beginning of the last financial year.That has created a loophole which means presenters\u0027 pay is routed through what is now classed an independent production company, meaning it no longer comes to them directly from the licence fee so does not have to be declared.The 17 actors who are paid over £150,000 for their roles on Casualty, Holby City and EastEnders will disappear from the list. The BBC\u0027s highest-paid actor is Casualty\u0027s Derek Thompson, who last year earned £350,000-399,999.Strictly Come Dancing salaries will also become secret, hiding the pay of presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, and judges Darcey Bussell, Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood and Shirley Ballas. Winkleman was the highest-paid woman on the list last year with a salary of £450,000-499,999.That included money from her weekly Radio 2 show. Other presenters whose shows fall within the loophole include Alex Jones (The One Show), Matt Baker (The One Show and Countryfile), Nick Knowles (DIY SOS), and Paul Martin (Flog It!).The secrecy allows for entertainment presenters and actors employed via BBC Studios to have their pay increased without it becoming public knowledge.Some broadcasters with a portfolio of shows will appear to fall down the salary league table, but only because part of their earnings are now off the books. For example, Fiona Bruce\u0027s salary for anchoring BBC One news bulletins will remain public, but her salary for Antiques Roadshow will not.Fiona Bruce\u0026#39s salary for anchoring BBC One news

way in transparency, is the only media organisation to release this data, and this year people will see we\u0027ll go even further in the information we publish.BBC Studios is now a commercial operation not underpinned by the licence fee so, just like the independent production companies it competes for business with, it isn\u0027t required to disclose salaries.Thailand cave rescue begins:

talks mike pompeo regrettable","story":"digitalservices@telegraphNorth Korea said the talks with Mr Pompeo were \u0026#34regrettable\u0026#34digitalservices@telegraphMike Pompeo hit back at North Korean accusations of gangster-like behaviour on Sunday and said sanctions on Pyongyang would only be lifted with final denuclearisation.Speaking in Tokyo after two days of intense discussions in Pyongyang, the US Secretary of State insisted the talks were making progress and were being conducted in good faith.In stark contrast, Pyongyang\u0027s take was overwhelmingly negative, with the North warning that the future of the peace process was being jeopardised by overbearing US demands for its unilateral nuclear disarmament.In Tokyo, Mr Pompeo briefed his Japanese and South Korean counterparts on the talks, and sought to reassure them that the dialogue with North Korea would continue.His trip to Pyongyang had been aimed at fleshing out denuclearisation commitments made during last month\u0027s historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.Rocket man: How Kim Jong-un emerged from his father\u0026#039s shadow to silence the doubtersNorth Korea has long trumpeted a denuclearisation goal, but one that it sees as a lengthy process of undefined multilateral disarmament on the entire Korean peninsula, rather than a unilateral dismantlement of its nuclear arsenal.Mr Pompeo said his efforts to push the North on disarmament had the backing of the entire international community.If those requests were gangster-like, the world is a gangster, because there was a unanimous decision at the UN Security Council about what needs to be achieved, he said.While insisting again that the talks were moving forwards, he stressed that nothing had happened to merit a relaxation of the tough sanctions imposed on the North over its nuclear missile programme.Sanctions will remain in place until final, fully verified denuclearisation as agreed to by Chairman Kim (Jong Un) occurs, Mr Pompeo said, adding that the US would seek to smooth the path by providing security guarantees requested by Pyongyang.In practical terms, Mr Pompeo mentioned only that officials from both sides would meet on July 12 to discuss the repatriation of the remains of some US soldiers killed during the 1950-1953 Korean War.Taro Kono, Japan\u0026#39s foreign minister, right, speaks during a news conference with Mike Pompeo, U.S. secretary of stateAmerica\u0027s top diplomat had attempted to receive specific commitments from the North Koreans on denuclearisation and the repatriation of the remains of American soldiers killed during the Korean War.However, in a statement reported by the North\u0027s official news agency, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said: We had expected that the US side would offer constructive measures that would help build trust based on the spirit of the leaders\u0027 summit ... we were also thinking about providing reciprocal measures.However, the attitude and stance the United States showed in the first high-level meeting (between the countries) was no doubt regrettable, the spokesman said. Our expectations and hopes were so naive it could be called foolish, he added.Mr Pompeo had admitted that there\u0027s still more work to be done, much of which would be done by working groups that the two sides have set up to deal with specific issues.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo greets North Korean Director of the United Front Department Kim Yong Chol as they arrive for a meeting at the Park Hwa Guest House in PyongyangThe North provided a much harsher assessment of the talks, saying that the United States betrayed the spirit of last month\u0027s summit between President Donald Trump and Kim by making one-sided and gangster-like demands on CVID, or the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea.It said the outcome of the follow-up talks was very concerning because it has led to a dangerous phase that might rattle our willingness for denuclearisation that had been firm.In the days following his historic June 12 summit with Kim in Singapore, Mr Trump claimed the return of the remains and the destruction of the missile facility had been completed or were in progress. It later emerged further talks were needed on both issues.The trip was Mr Pompeo\u0027s third to Pyongyang since April and his first since the summit.North Korea’s fiery relationship with the USUnlike his previous visits, which have been one-day affairs during which he has met with Kim Jong-un, Mr Pompeo spent the night at a government guesthouse in Pyongyang and did not see the North Korean leader, although US officials had suggested such a meeting was expected.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said no meeting with Kim had been planned.As they began their talks on Saturday, Kim Yong-chol alluded to the fact that Mr Pompeo and his delegation had stayed overnight in Pyongyang.We did have very serious discussions on very important matters yesterday, Mr Kim told him. So, thinking about those discussions you might have not slept well last night.Mr Pompeo, who spoke with Mr Trump, national security adviser John Bolton and White House chief of staff John Kelly by secure phone before starting Saturday\u0027s session, replied that he slept just fine.He added that the Trump administration was committed to reaching a deal under which North Korea would denuclearise and realise economic benefits in return.Mr Kim later said there are things that I have to clarify to which Mr Pompeo responded that there are things that I have to clarify as well.There was no immediate explanation of what issues needed to be clarified, but the two sides have been struggling to specify what exactly denuclearisation would entail and how it could be verified to the satisfaction of the United States.Mr Pompeo and Mr Kim met for nearly three hours on Friday and then had dinner amid growing scepticism over how serious the North Korean leader is about giving up his nuclear arsenal and translating the upbeat rhetoric following his summit with Mr Trump into concrete action.Please review our commenting policyThailand cave rescue begins: Operation to bring out first group of trapped boys to take about 11 hoursComment: From Adam Smith onwards, classical liberals have known that capitalism makes people less selfishGovernment drops doctor who says gender given at birthWomen RAF pilots \u0026#39forgotten\u0026#39 in centenary celebrations, say relativesTeacher at leading boys’ school arrested on suspicion of sexual misconduct with pupilsIt is easier to win major literary awards by writing a lead character who is a man, Booker Prize-winning authors warnJapan floods: Scores dead and dozens missing as two million are told to evacuate amid record rainsQueen\u0026#39s patronage has single-handedly saved the British hat industry, Philip Treacy saysSalisbury poisonings: Police officer  given all-clear after fears of exposure to nerve agentMPs will lose their landlines as national copper shortage means suppliers can only offer SkypeDuchess of Sussex’s visit to Dublin will be world away from last trip to the city... when she pulled the perfect pint of Guinness How Brexiteers\u0026#39 hopes were shattered by a single meetingNato summit: Fears Trump may pull troops out of EuropeComment: Donald Trump will be an honoured guest on his visit to the United Kingdom\u0026#39First Wives Club\u0026#39 left with \u0026#39next to nothing\u0026#39 seek perjury charges against husbands and associatesBrighton Beach erupts in a sea of jubilation and lager as England reach the semi-finalsComment: As we prepare to leave the EU, we must contemplate the possibility of our lights going outHostility and anger towards church on social media is stopping abuse survivors coming forward, vicar warns BBC stars say broadcaster is \u0026#39humiliating\u0026#39 them as it plans to publish salaries in £10k bandsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/07/TELEMMGLPICT000167337890_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqfmgeF2dx0hOECM5mU3om-L0A8uG62qxKflOjPKk4Cfo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"queenspatronage has single handedly saved british hat industry","story":"digitalservices@telegraphQueen Elizabeth arrives for the final day of Royal Ascot Race in Junedigitalservices@telegraphShe has been on the throne for more than 65 years, fulfiling her public duties, unifying the Commonwealth and providing the steady role-model the nation needs in turbulent times.The Queen has also single-handedly kept the hat industry in business, according to Philip Treacy.Treacy, the milliner used regularly by members of the Royal family, said the Queen had “kept hats alive in the imagination of people all over the world”, ensuring their survival even as most of her subjects largely abandoned them.Now, he said, young women are choosing to wear hats again as they come back into fashion as an accessory of “rebellion”.Speaking on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Treacy, who made dozens of hats for guests at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, said: “The patronage of the Royal Family keeps hats alive.Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, making her Royal Ascot debut in June“The patronage of Her Majesty the Queen has kept hats alive in the imagination of people all over the world.“She\u0027s worn hats for all her life.“If the Royal Family chose not to wear hats - let\u0027s say in the 60s and 70s when some people gave up on them  - I wouldn\u0027t be sitting here having this conversation with you“Hats are part of the culture of Englishness and of Britishness.”Of changing fashions, he said: “A hat has changed from a conformist accessory to an accessory of rebellion, almost.“When I started 28 years ago it was a much more mature customer and there were no young girls.

There is little mention of them and their role at the RAF Museum in Hendon and nothing to recognise what they did as part of the 100th Anniversary commemorations.”Mrs Atkins, a teacher from Taunton, Somerset, added: “My mother and the other women made a huge contribution to the war, delivering the planes to the pilots from the factories and then becoming the first women to get their RAF wings.”The History of the Royal Air ForceJackie Wetherill, who is planning to make a documentary about The Famous Five, said: “these women were the first to get their wings with the RAF as a result of the huge amount of hours they flew delivering planes during the war.“What they did was astonishing. They had barely any training, no radio contact and no weaponry, yet they flew fighter planes hot off the production line to the airbases where they were so desperately needed to defend Britain.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously.

Heavy rains led to them becoming trapped.They were feared lost until more than a week later, when four British cave ers \u0026ndash Rick Stanton, John Volanthen, Robert Harper and Vern Unsworth \u0026ndash working closely with Thai navy ers, found them.

The boys are being taught to swim and use oxygen tanks. One idea is for expert \u0026ldquobuddy ers to help guide them out. Cave ers have delivered notes from the boys to their frantic families, who in turn have sent loving messages back to them to boost morale.

Night loves everyone. I love Dad, Mum and everyone. He turned 16 on the day the group entered the cave on June 13.

refusing to criticise the PM.He said: “I have real respect for Theresa May and I know that her duty, her daily work is not so easy.”But a document setting out Britain’s plan for a future relationship with Brussels set out plans for a “mobility framework” that would allow UK and EU citizens “to travel to each other’s territories and apply for study and work”.The document added this would be “similar to what the UK may offer other close trading partners in the future.”Home Secrertary Sajid Javid is only expected to set out Britain’s post Brexit immigration plans AFTER a provision deal with the EU is agreed this October.During a conciliatory speech at the Irish embassy in Brussels, the Frenchman also called on both sides to “de-dramatise” the Northern Irish border issue.And he hinted that the EU is waiting to kickstart the negotiations on renewed terms if Mrs May softens her red lines.But one MP said: “I need to see the detail but I’m extremely wary.“It sounds to me like we’re going to be rule taker rather than the a rule maker.“It’s feels we are danger of total capitulation to Brussels.”And Brexiteer critics were giving an unlikely boost from arch-remainer Sir Nick Clegg who said they were right to reject Mrs May’s third way custom fudge that would lead to “vast red tape” while “smugglers would boom” and “Parliament left humiliated” as a simple rubber stamper.Tempers had already reached boiling point in the run up to the summit after Downing Street publicly warned one in Government who quit could watch her soft-Brexit march continue from the sidelines.No10 insiders revealed emergency reshuffle plans were already in place incase of Ministerial walkouts from her crunch Brexit summit.The day was broken into three sections with the first seeing Brexit guru Olly Robbins brief ministers on the “Available Outcomes in Light of the EU’s Current Position”.But the testy exchanges were seen in the afternoon’s session titled The UK’s Proposed Approach”.Before the ministers had even sat down around the table Downing Street infuriated them by warning that they would have to get a taxi home as they would be stripped of their limos immediately if they walked out in protest.A senior Government source said: “Taxi cards for Aston’s taxis the local cab firm are in the foyer for those who decide they can’t face making the right decision for the country but it will still be a long walk as it is a mile long driveway.The official raged: “A select number of narcissistic, leadership dominated cabinet ministers need to support the PM in the best interests of the UK or their spots will be taken by a talented new generation of MPs who will sweep them away.”And The Sun revealed that the whips had summoned dozens of junior ministers for a series of meetings to sound them out over the PM’s plans as possible future cabinet replacements in the case of a mass walkout.Housing minister Dominic Raab, Crime minister Victoria Atkins and Local Government minister Kit Malthouse were touted as possible replacements.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Signalling that the UK might stay in a Customs Union was another enormous error.Downing Street has consistently left unchallenged the scare tactics of professional Remainers — big businesses seeking ongoing EU protection, Brussels-funded think tanks and member states wanting UK cash.The Irish land border, for instance, already copes with different currencies, duties and other tax rates.Outside the Customs Union there is no need for physical hard border posts that might inflame sectarian sensitivities — as confirmed by the head of HMRC, his Irish equivalent and a study published by the European Parliament.Instead of explaining these realities, and arguing Britain’s corner, Mrs May has allowed Irish border falsehoods to warp her entire Brexit strategy.Roberto Azevedo insisted trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules was “perfectly manageable”.She has similarly failed to counter claims it would be disastrous to leave the EU with no free trade agreement, using World Trade Organisation rules instead.Again, this is nonsense. Britain already conducts most of its trade outside the EU, largely under WTO rules.“It is not the end of the world if UK-EU trade is on the basis of WTO rules”, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo told me. “It’s ­perfectly manageable.”That’s a vital insight because, unless no deal is seen as a viable option, the UK’s negotiating hand is seriously undermined — with Britain then forced to accept whatever trade deal the EU offers as March 2019 nears.The Government should have been making determined and very visible preparations for no deal.The irony is that, behind the scenes, there has been considerable work.Last week the National Audit Office concluded that an HMRC upgrade that was happening anyway means ­Britain’s customs service should be ready to cope with no deal from January 2019.Instead of pursuing such rational strategies, Mrs May now wants the UK, in effect, to stay in the Single Market for goods, while facing greater restrictions on trade in services.This is totally lopsided — Britain is far better at exporting services (we run a £14billion annual surplus with the EU) than goods (which show a £96billion EU deficit).And proposals to solve the Irish border by tracking goods and collecting the EU’s tariff revenues have already been rejected by Brussels.Mrs May should just leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, with no deal if necessary.By presenting absurd ideas, our Mad Hatter Prime Minister appears to hope her people will conclude Brexit is too hard and should be abandoned.If so, she doesn’t understand the country she purports to govern.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Youre partying with them!

“similar to what the UK may offer other close trading partners in the future.”Home Secrertary Sajid Javid is only expected to set out Britain’s post Brexit immigration plans AFTER a provision deal with the EU is agreed this October.During a conciliatory speech at the Irish embassy in Brussels, the Frenchman also called on both sides to “de-dramatise” the Northern Irish border issue.And he hinted that the EU is waiting to kickstart the negotiations on renewed terms if Mrs May softens her red lines.But one MP said: “I need to see the detail but I’m extremely wary.“It sounds to me like we’re going to be rule taker rather than the a rule maker.“It’s feels we are danger of total capitulation to Brussels.”And Brexiteer critics were giving an unlikely boost from arch-remainer Sir Nick Clegg who said they were right to reject Mrs May’s third way custom fudge that would lead to “vast red tape” while “smugglers would boom” and “Parliament left humiliated” as a simple rubber stamper.Tempers had already reached boiling point in the run up to the summit after Downing Street publicly warned one in Government who quit could watch her soft-Brexit march continue from the sidelines.No10 insiders revealed emergency reshuffle plans were already in place incase of Ministerial walkouts from her crunch Brexit summit.The day was broken into three sections with the first seeing Brexit guru Olly Robbins brief ministers on the “Available Outcomes in Light of the EU’s Current Position”.But the testy exchanges were seen in the afternoon’s session titled The UK’s Proposed Approach”.Before the ministers had even sat down around the table Downing Street infuriated them by warning that they would have to get a taxi home as they would be stripped of their limos immediately if they walked out in protest.A senior Government source said: “Taxi cards for Aston’s taxis the local cab firm are in the foyer for those who decide they can’t face making the right decision for the country but it will still be a long walk as it is a mile long driveway.The official raged: “A select number of narcissistic, leadership dominated cabinet ministers need to support the PM in the best interests of the UK or their spots will be taken by a talented new generation of MPs who will sweep them away.”And The Sun revealed that the whips had summoned dozens of junior ministers for a series of meetings to sound them out over the PM’s plans as possible future cabinet replacements in the case of a mass walkout.Housing minister Dominic Raab, Crime minister Victoria Atkins and Local Government minister Kit Malthouse were touted as possible replacements.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mass deportations of illegal immigrants? Jawohl!And don’t mention the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag.What a change of heart. Merkel’s solution to the refugee crisis of 2015 was to dismantle Germany’s borders.No elected politician in modern history has ever acted with such monumental, breath-taking arrogance.Merkel’s grandiose virtue signalling unleashed mass, mostly economic migration that continues to this day.More than a million refugees poured into Germany in 2015 alone. They were almost exclusively young men because the old, the sick and children — the most vulnerable refugees and those most deserving of a helping hand — can’t walk the length of the Balkans.Anyone who had doubts about promoting limitless uncontrolled migration was silenced by Merkel’s smug catchphrase, “Wir schaffen das!” — We can do this!But Germany, and Europe, will pay the price for Angela Merkel’s apocalyptic arrogance long after she is pushing up edelweiss.Merkel’s career is on its knees because she permanently changed Germany without ever consulting the German people to see if her policy of the unmanaged migration of one million-plus young males from a totally different culture was actually WHAT THEY WANTED.Merkel never even thought about the wishes of the German people. We hear a lot about the rise of “populism” everywhere from Trump’s America to the new, vehemently anti-EU coalition government in Italy.But there is no great mystery about the rise of anti- establishment sentiment. For decades haughty politicians have viewed their own people with unbridled, undisguised, unapologetic contempt.Now, all over the Western world, they are paying the price.Theresa May should carefully study the fall of Angela Merkel. Whatever the polls might say, few would weep to see May departing Downing Street.It seems increasingly likely, from what we’re hearing out of Chequers, that this prime minister would far prefer to cuddle up to the crumbling EU empire rather than break free and strike trade deals with the US, Australia, Canada, India and China.But if we can’t trade with the world then it is not a soft Brexit. It is no bloody Brexit at all.Her job is not to soften our departure from the EU to such a degree that it becomes meaningless.Whatever her personal preferences, Theresa May’s job, and the historic role that falls to her now, is to honour the referendum of 2016, the vote we were solemnly promised was final by our former prime minister, David Cameron.It is not complicated. Don’t do a Merkel.Theresa May has to respect democracy and the will of the British people.And if she doesn’t or she can’t, if May betrays the British people, if she castrates or buggers up Brexit, if she tells 17.4million that they are ignorant racist bigots who should never have had a vote in the first place, then we are going to need a new prime minister.In Merkel’s spectacular fall from power there is a lesson for every leader in the Western world, especially Theresa May.You are not our master. You are our servant. You do not know best. And you ignore the will of your people at your peril.THIS World Cup has been a revelation. Who knew we would still be working up a sweat long after Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Spain had flown home?Who knew that England could win a penalty shoot-out in a World Cup? Then cruise through a quarter-final?And who knew England could only ever really succeed again – and true success means having a team that we love and take pride in – if we returned to having English managers? All jaw-dropping stuff.Now Alicia Aylies – former Miss France and the girlfriend of France’s fleet-footed Kylian Mbappe – proudly poses in a zippy bralet.Seriously, who had ever heard of the zippy bralet until Russia 2018? The shocks just keep on coming.FOR two weeks every year, the British go crazy about tennis.The Australian Open, Roland-Garros in France and the US Open hardly merit a second glance from the British public but Wimbledon is an essential part of our calendar.Yet this year our attention has been distracted by another sporting event in a distant land. The men’s singles final will overlap with the World Cup Final.But quite frankly, who cares?This year we are lukewarm on Wimbledon.So you had to feel for British wildcard Katie Boulter, knocked out in the second round.There is still plenty of time for Henman Hill or Murray Mound to become Boulter’s Bulge or Katie’s Cusp.LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan is allowing a Donald Trump blimp to float above London during the President’s visit to the UK.No news yet on if Khan has plans to do anything about the gun, knife and acid epidemic on the streets of London.With well over 1,000 stabbings this year, more than fifty of them fatal, crime in London is out of control.But at least we have that Trump balloon, Sadiq.DIEGO MARADONA was pictured grinning happily in an XXL Colombia shirt before their match with England but was apoplectic in defeat.“You have to denounce this,” fumed Maradona.“As the captain of legends, I have to tell Infantino (Fifa President) this cannot be left like this.“This is a fatal mistake for the whole country.”I’m sure it all sounds much better in translation.But you get the gist – “Our headbutting boys were robbed”.Fifa hands Maradona a reported £7,000 to turn up at every match and the fat man issued a grovelling apology for criticising the ref when he reflected that seven grand might possibly slip through his cheating hands.But you can hardly blame Diego Maradona for sticking up for those grappling, nasty, spiteful, penalty-spot-scuffing Colombians.After all, Diego has done his best to single-handedly prop up one of Colombia’s major exports. And that’s nothing to sniff at.YOUNG mum Claire Morrison, 28, was mortified when her six-year-old daughter Eve took her vibrator to school for show-and-tell because Eve thought it was a particularly interesting looking pen.Some parents might prefer to keep quiet about this mishap, but Claire has gone on Facebook to tell the “hilarious” story.“She just said it was her funny pink pen,” chuckles Claire, a hairdresser from Dundee. “Then she said, ‘It must talk because it needs batteries’. So her stepdad and I laughed that off and we have safely stored it away.”It has now been shared 6,000 times.The story. Not the vibrator. Obviously. That wouldn’t be very hygienic.WE can all understand why David and Victoria Beckham would want to put on a public display of loving solidarity on their wedding anniversary.But I can’t help wondering, does Victoria really need to tell David “I love you so much” via her Instagram account and its 21.3million followers? It seems so extravagantly public.Couldn’t she just give him a card?AFTER careful consideration, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted to keep their £3,900-a-month taxpayer-funded (and tax-free) expenses a secret.Blow me down. Nobody saw that one coming.The generous expenses, known as the general expenditure allowance, or GEA, are paid as a lump sum into the MEPs salary, with no records kept, no receipts required and no questions asked. MEPs can spend it all on prostitutes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates if they want.Nobody cares.The GEA costs around £35million a year.And our corrupt continental cousins wonder why we’re leaving.DAVID Cameron received £800,000 to write his memoirs, which have been unexpectedly delayed until next year.Cameron should tell us why he made it legally binding for this country to spend £13billion a year on foreign aid, why he bombed Libya into the failed state it is today and how he blew £9million of public money on his pro-EU leaflet. And still lost!It also transpires that it was Cameron who begged Barack Obama to say, “The UK is going to be in the back of the queue,” if we dared to leave the EU.You shouldn’t be writing your memoirs, Mr Cameron.You should be writing us a letter of apology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their behaviour has been unforgivable.”Open warfare erupted among Tories with MPs of all factions at each others’ throats.It wasn’t just the PM and Cabinet Remainers who bore the brunt of their anger.The seven Brexit ministers were branded “cowards” for refusing to resign rather than back the soft Brexit plan.They in turn, railed against former Remainer ministers – including Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson - who had publicly declared they now support Brexit.One minister said: “They are all talk and no trousers. When the going got tough the deserted us.”Brexit cheerleader Boris Johnson was blasted for failing to quit the Cabinet.The reputations of Trade supremo Liam Fox and Brexit Secretary David Davis have also plummeted among the troops.An ally of Mr Johnson said: “The only people who would benefit from Boris leaving Cabinet would be Barnier, Merkel, Selmayr and the rest of those negotiating for the EU.“There is no doubt that we would be heading for an even softer Brexit had Boris not been around the Cabinet table – and it could still get worse.“This is why he is determined to continue in his role and make the argument for Brexiteers.”Another pal added: “Boris accepts Cabinet responsibility but still wants to be there and fighting.Another said Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s leadership ambitions had been “shot to bits” for leaving Brexit colleagues “high and dry” at Friday’s summit.Backbench MPs will decide this week whether they can muster the numbers to try to oust the PM.They need 48 to force a confidence vote – but it is thought they will struggle to raise the numbers.There were mounting suspicions that a deal was stitched up by EU-friendly civil servants and their colleagues in Brussels which would be easier to drive through in talks later this month.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “I have deep concerns that this is not what the British public voted for.”Tory MP Andrew Bridgen added: “The government’s Brexit position is very weak beer, even before the EU start to water it down even further.”“If he leaves, the plan is only going to get softer. He will strongly resist any further creep in that direction.”Mr Davis spoke to EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday to talk through the Chequers proposals.Jacob Rees-Mogg said the deal could be “worse” than a “no deal” Brexit and suggested it broke the Conservatives’ manifesto promises.Mr Rees-Mogg, the leader of a 60-strong group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, said tying the UK with EU rules and regulations could make “trade deals almost impossible”.“As with eggs: an egg that is very softly boiled isn’t boiled at all,” he said. “A very soft Brexit means that we haven’t left, we are simply a rule-taker.“That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.”Mr Rees-Mogg said he was waiting to see the full details of the proposals to check if Theresa May’s previously-drawn red lines had turned “pink” but said that if the legislation shows it will be a “punishment Brexit” then it will be effectively “keeping us in the European Union in all but name”.“The Prime Minister will, I’m sure, stick to her word - that is crucially important - but I will certainly stick to the Conservatives’ manifesto commitments and will not vote for something that doesn’t deliver Brexit.”“It is possible that this deal is worse” than a “no deal” Brexit, Mr Rees-Mogg said.Sir Bill Cash told BBC’s Newsnight he was “deeply disappointed, to say the least” and the plans “raise a lot of very serious questions”.Meanwhile, Chris Grayling, the Transport Secretary and Brexiteer, said: “I didn’t campaign to leave the European Union to have a different specification of motor car on sale in the UK to the one that’s on sale in France.“This is simply saying that we will effectively sell the same products across Europe as we do now – it’s what business does and would do anyway, nobody produces a different product for one country.”Nigel Dodds, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party at Westminster, praised Mrs May’s proposals and said: “The Government’s commitment at Chequers to the political and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom with no borders between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom is a welcome reaffirmation of what is an absolute priority for us.The Government’s failure to plan for “no deal” and the PM’s dithering has forced us into doing a lot of the EU’s work for them, watering down a genuinely clean Brexit into an unambitious fudge.But we have now, finally, put the ball in Brussels’ court. And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.“Most sensible people recognise that it would be economically catastrophic as well as politically unacceptable to hive Northern Ireland off into some kind of hybrid status within the EU. That is not going to happen.”However, he also warned the Government “must deliver on what the people of the United Kingdom voted for in the referendum, namely, control of our borders, our laws and our money” - adding that the DUP will be checking the “fine print” of the White Paper when it is published next week. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Luckily, we have some expert turd-polishers in this government.”His colourful outburst came as he caved in to Mrs May’s demand to get behind her blueprint for a soft Brexit.Boris threw in the towel after a 12-hour battle to reshape the proposal, which will tie Britain to a swathe of EU rules.But he could barely disguise his disappointment at signing up to a Remainer-inspired deal. He said: “It’s been a tough day for a Brexiteer.” He led the charge by Eurosceptic ministers to toughen the list of demands to be presented at exit talks in Brussels on July 16.One who was present said: “They all put up a brave fight but they were outnumbered and worn down during a long, hard day.“In the end, their resistance just fizzled out and they signed up to the package.”Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey argued passionately for a much harder starting position.She was backed by Commons leader Andrea Leadsom and Aid Secretary Penny Mordaunt. But their resistance weakened when Environment Secretary Michael Gove agreed to the PM’s plan.The summit’s mood lightened as, one by one, the Brexiteers were picked off.One minister even pulled out a family pack of Haribo Supermix and passed it around the debating table.When they reached Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has just launched a drive to tackle child obesity, he told colleagues: “I should take these off you.”Boris had warned that taking rules from Brussels while having no say inside the EU would reduce Britain to a colony of a European superstate. He is reported to have said: “It would reduce us to a ­vassal state.“We’ve been blaming many of our problems over the past 30 years on EU-imposed legislation. We are now saying we need to keep all these regulations as they are vital to our economic health.”But other ministers teamed up to convince him that while he might not like this version of Brexit, it is better than that on offer from a Remain-supporting Parliament.An insider said: “It was a bit like a hung jury where two or three are holding out against the majority.“It finally dawned on Boris and others that they could stay up all night arguing but in the end the only two options would be to sign up to Theresa’s plan or resign.”The Government’s failure to plan for “no deal” and the PM’s dithering has forced us into doing a lot of the EU’s work for them, watering down a genuinely clean Brexit into an unambitious fudge.But we have now, finally, put the ball in Brussels’ court.

If young people spend most of the weekend behind the console it doesn’t mean that this person has a gaming disorder and it doesn’t mean that this person will develop a gaming disorder.”His comments will spark fresh claims that playing games online for hours at a time is not an addiction compared to drugs and alcohol.Dr Poznyak added: “It would be premature to say that we have now sufficient evidence to identify the most vulnerable individuals.He added: “But first of all, we know that it’s males, it’s boys and young men and those of course who are engaged in gaming behaviour.”The row comes as millions of youngsters are gripped by new computer game Fortnite.Since launching a free version early this year, the game has been played by 125 million people - earning its producers, the US software company Epic Games around £230 million a month.Among those gripped by the game are England world Cup stars Harry Kane and Dele Alli.Team mate Jesse Lingard did a celebration dance based on the game after scoring for England against Panama.One boy, 15, from London spent eight weeks in hospital because of his ‘all-consuming’ gaming addiction, including Fortnite.He also needed to take vitamin D tablets because of a lack of sunlight.The first UK centre for gaming addiction will open in the coming weeks and also aid young sufferers’ families.The clinic will treat adults and children with gaming disorders, with children as young as nine needing help for addictions to violent video games such as Fortnite.Spain, where there is already an established internet treatment clinic, treats around 50 gaming addicts a year.Poznyak was born in Belarus and has a background in drug and alcohol abuse research.In 1991 he was awarded his doctorate in medicine, in Moscow studying ‘Alcoholism in women: clinic and genetic aspects.’But Tory MP Kevin Foster said: “Parents need to play a greater role in the well-being of their children.“If there are problems they should be on hand to stop issues such as this from escalating. It shouldn’t always be left to the NHS to pick up the pieces.“Also, big companies who make vast profits from these games should also be asked to help foot the bill for these gaming addiction clinics.”A spokesman for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which is overseeing the new NHS gaming clinic said it was not yet clear how much public money would be spent.He added that the new unit is initially being funded with charity and research funds.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done.

And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.IT is astonishing that £13,000 of taxpayers’ cash has been dished out to allow a man serving life for murder to indulge his musical passions by staging a rock opera in jail.That’s money taken from the pockets of working families who have to scrimp and save because the taxman milks them at the petrol pump, the checkout till and in their paycheque.Why did the Arts Council think it appropriate to give the fruits of their labour to a monster like Graham Coutts?The law-abiding public deserve so much better.ENGLAND in a World Cup semi-final.

I think when people voted to leave the European Union, they wanted an end to free movement - free movement will end.They wanted us to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK - that will end.They wanted us to stop sending the vast sums of money every year to the EU that we do today, and so take control of our money, our laws and our borders - and thats exactly what we will do.But well do it in a way that protects and enhances our economy for the future.Tories are being invited to briefings about the plans, with the Prime Minister set to address Conservative MPs at a meeting in Parliament on Monday.The first briefing was led by Chief Whip Julian Smith and Mrs Mays chief of staff Gavin Barwell, with 10 Tory MPs attending the Saturday morning session.It comes a day after May reportedly threatened to sack Boris Johnson after claiming her crushing victory over Brexiteer ministers.The Prime Minister is said to have promised allies she will not tolerate any attempt by the Foreign Secretary to undermine the deal.The Times revealed her threat to Boris following a marathon all-day summit at her Buckinghamshire country retreat, at which they agreed a Soft Brexit 12-point plan that will tie Britain to Brussels rules for goods and mirror EU judges diktats.In a letter to Conservative MPs later, May made clear that ministers who complained about her plan would be sacked.She said: “As we developed our policy on Brexit I have allowed cabinet colleagues to express their individual views.Agreement on this proposal marks the point where that is no longer the case and collective responsibility is now fully restored.It followed fears Mr Johnson would lead half-a-dozen Eurosceptics to quit.May appears to have faced down Brexiteer Cabinet ministers after securing agreement on plans which will keep the UK closely aligned to Brussels.The proposals will now be assessed by the European Union.But under the Governments plans the UK would be free to diverge from EU rules over services, a major part of the British economy, with ministers acknowledging this will reduce the levels of access available to European markets.Brussels will be reluctant to support any plan which would risk splitting the single market, and ministers appeared to acknowledge this by agreeing to step up preparations for a no deal Brexit.But Mrs May said she hoped the proposals, which will be produced in a formal White Paper next week, would enable talks with the EU to move forward.Pro-Brexit groups were scathing of the PMs Brexit blueprint.In a withering assessment Leave Means Leave boss John Longworth said the PM had totally misled 17.4million voters and branded her plans a fake Brexit.However, business leaders, who have raised concerns about the impact of Brexit on jobs and the economy, welcomed the Cabinet agreement.Despite the plan, Mrs Mays position could still be under threat from Tory Brexiteers.Backbencher Andrea Jenkyns said she was awaiting the detail of the plans before deciding whether or not to support calls for a leadership contest."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjA4MTsiGN_4355363.jpg?20180706221224 ","title":"chequers mate brexiters rely on eu rejecting pms win","story":"More than that, as was made clear in an email to MPs afterwards, for the first time since February 2016, cabinet collective responsibility on Brexit was firmly reasserted.No more special licence for ministers to speak their mind on this issue. Any minister freelancing with long personal manifestos or private recorded statements will be fired.Other delighted cabinet ministers included Business Secretary Greg Clark, defender of Airbus and Jaguar Land Rover, who said it was a \"very positive conclusion\" which meant \"zero friction\" for trade between UK and EU countries and Justice Secretary David Gauke, who praised the \"positive support from cabinet for Theresa May and her Brexit plan\".Not much from the Brexiteers just yet.:: \u0027Sell out\u0027 free trade area plans torn apart by BrexiteersThe statement of agreement was emailed to the press as dinner began, without cabinet ministers having contact with their advisers, giving two hours for newspapers to conjure \"PM wrestles Brexit triumph\" style headlines, on a day when most of the country will want to return to the World Cup, rather than squabbling political parties.The European Union will not accept this plan, and that much has been made clear.But that was easy for them while there was no plan and no unified position even to have to consider.Now there is something for them to bite into. A conversation to be started. Their initial response to actually having a negotiation partner was warmish. But they were careful not to sound too dismissive about the wider attempt to enjoy existing economic terms with the single market where the UK feels it is in its interest, without the payments or adherence to freedom of movement.The most significant piece of the agreement is that the government has changed its position on what it wants from ongoing trade with the European Union.No longer is it \"as frictionless as possible\", which was always fairly meaningless but actually \"frictionless\".The PM has been persuaded by the arguments of business, the car industry and Airbus in particular, that any border checks would fundamentally imperil the business strategies that have led them to thrive in the UK and in particular their supply chains.The answer is a \"free trade area for goods\" with a common rule book which is in essence participation in a goods customs union and single market, with some eventual flexibility to conduct independent trade externally, when tariff tracking technology is developed.:: Behind the scenes of crunch Brexit talksIt is not membership of these structures however.The UK becomes rule-taker of the EU interpretation of these rules for globalised industries.The theory, however, is that the UK will have had strong influence in the setting of the global standards in the first place, so not a total rule-taker.It is a position that envisages the development in coming decades of global standards in advanced manufacturing and trade. The inclusion of agriculture in this system is to keep borders open both in Northern Ireland and at Dover, Holyhead and the Channel Tunnel.The gravitational pull on any future government not to change tariffs will be strong, but the UK parliament will have the power to change them.Britain will have taken back some control, but in other senses (directly influencing the EU rules) have lost it.Brexiteer backbenchers were restrained immediately, but anger is brewing. \"As bad as I feared,\" said one.A despondent Brexiteer MP said he was \"deeply disappointed, this is associate membership of the EU, we haven\u0027t worked so hard all these years for this\".One very pro-Brexit junior minister told me: \"If this was the final deal, then I could probably live with it as a necessary compromise. But EU will never accept it (cherry picking, four freedoms indivisible etc), so what happens next?\" Indeed why you would choose to lay out such tough red lines if you thought things might end up here is a bit of a mystery.How Brexiteer cabinet ministers have signed up to this having argued so publicly for \"a clean Brexit\" is another.\"I can\u0027t see how they can accept this and not look a laughing stock,\" one former senior minister said.It is early days yet. One ministerial aide suggested the analogy of a budget that unravels after a time delay of two days, would be the correct analogy.The most evident possible method for that is the section on a \"labour mobility partnership\" which suggests maintaining mutual freedom to move and then apply for study and jobs [presumably not benefits] between UK and EU. This will help lubricate any single market deal. It will also inflame internal political opposition.There is also a section on \"no deal\" preparations, meant as a stick for the EU and a carrot for Brexiteers.If the PM cannot stomach a Canada-style trade deal because of the negative impact on advanced manufacturers, it seems that \"no deal\" is inconceivable.So we are left in an extraordinary position.The hard Brexiteers need the EU to reject this out of hand now.The EU will have noted the shift in Government position, the actual adoption of one, and see a landing point at least for many years that is close to the European Economic Area (EEA) plus customs union solution they anticipate and prefer.We are probably three quarters of the way there already.Do they split the difference and pay lip service to a magical Europe-wide tariff refund IT system in a few years? Or do they undo the PM\u0027s impressive manoeuvres with outright rejection?The devil will be in the detail, to be released in the white paper."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-world-cup-england-fans_4356179.jpg?20180707190904 ","title":"england to face croatia in world cup semi finals","story":"Despite that, it was a jittery first half with England coming close several times.

Visitors must leave by 25 July. To order one you must hold a match ticket, even if you don\u0027t actually intend on attending the game.The UK Foreign Office told Sky News that the process of applying for a Fan ID once a match ticket has been purchased is quick and an electronic version is suitable to travel on. A physical version can be picked up in Russia.Travellers also must have a passport valid for the duration of their trip.The Foreign Office website advises that if travelling on a British passport issued since January 2017, it must be signed with a black pen before anyone travels as some British nationals who haven\u0027t signed theirs have been denied entry into Russia. I\u0027ve got my documents, how do I get there?Bear in mind that the main international airport (Sheremetyevo) is around two hours from Luzhniki Stadium by public transport. It is around half that by car - on a good day.If you\u0027re travelling from London, the latest you could leave is probably the 10.40am departure from Heathrow, which arrives in Moscow at 4.25pm.

A flight arriving at 5.05pm will take five hours and 45 minutes, setting you back \u0026#163615. There\u0027s a six-hour journey arriving at 3.20pm for about the same price. I don\u0027t want to fly, how else can I get there?If you have the endurance, driving will take you around 29 hours - it\u0027s about1,800 miles.

Massive stress, exhausting hours, poor pay, fear of making mistakes and inability to guarantee patients’ safety have all contributed to staff wanting out of wards in their tens of thousands. A shocking 43 per cent say they are feeling so much strain they would like to leave the profession right now. Half are under daily pressure to save cash, have witnessed patients suffer due to Tory cuts and seen rationing of services that were free five years ago. Three-quarters say the service no longer has enough staff to look after people safely. And an overwhelming 78 per cent – four out of five – feel under-valued and unfairly paid. One nurse told the survey, carried out by the Sunday Mirror with Nursing Standard magazine: “Everyone is pushed to the limit of capability.” The poll paints a grim picture in the week that saw the NHS, which employs 300.000 nurses and midwives, mark the 70th anniversary of its launch in 1948. The only ray of light is that an amazing 68 per cent of nurses STILL feel proud to have played a role in the service.  Tonight Janet Davies, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: “This tragic situation is the result of many years of short-sighted cost-cutting and ineffective workforce planning. “Too many politicians and policymakers don’t recognise the value of nursing. Extra funding must begin to turn this around by investing in staff to stop the haemorrhaging we see.” Our poll also found 42 per cent of nurses feel stressed most of the time and 16 per cent all of the time. Another 42 per cent say morale is poor, with 19 per cent describing it as at rock bottom. One nurse told us she was having to care for up to 30 patients each, almost four times the one-to-eight ratio in guidelines. Another told how 16 staff had left and been replaced by only two while shifts put out to the “bank” of floating stand-ins often went unfilled. One nurse said: “Many colleagues are leaving or having time off for stress. They are disillusioned and work in a state of anxiety due to the fear of error in poorly-staffed wards.” Another described their job as “like being on a production line” rather than dealing with people. One said: “I will retire as soon as I can and work in Tesco’s.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa braces herself bid tory","story":"NewsTheresa May braces herself for bid by Tory MPs to oust her over BrexitThe PM, due to address all 316 Tory MPs on Monday, is expecting enough of them to oppose her to mount a no-confidence vote on her leadership\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor21:56, 7 JUL 2018Newsrime Minister Theresa May and members of her Cabinet meet at her country retreat Chequers (Image: Getty Images Europe)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May is bracing herself for a bid by Tory MPs to oust her following her soft Brexit fudge. The PM, due to address all 316 Tory MPs on Monday, is expecting enough of them to oppose her to mount a no-confidence vote on her leadership. But she relishes the opportunity to finally end the plotting against her. An aide told the Sunday Mirror: “Once it’s done, it’s done.” Although Mrs May got her new Brexit plan through Cabinet without any walkouts, ministers fear it will be rejected by Brussels. Europe goes on holiday in August. So only six weeks remain before an agreement must be reached at the EU Council summit in October.  Ministers have now stepped up their planning for a no-deal Brexit – while chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier is waiting to see whether the new proposal is “workable and realistic”. Brexit rebel leader Jacob Rees-Mogg warned he “will not vote for something which doesn’t deliver Brexit”. Graham Brady, chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, is believed to be just six letters short of the 48 needed to trigger a vote of no \u0026shyconfidence in the PM. If Mrs May lost a vote she would have to stand down and there would be a leadership contest. But Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith, who briefed 40 MPs on the fudge yesterday, believes Mrs May would win a vote easily.

Revellers were celebrating the Three Lions\u0027 World Cup win over Sweden when the unsuspecting woman was knocked onto the floor in Clapham Junction, south London. In the video, horrified witnesses scream and a young boy looks on as the woman gets up and looks down at her hands and arms to see if she is injured. Fans went wild after England knocked off Sweden to advance to the semi-final, but some took their celebrations too far as they climbed on top of vehicles or damaged property.  Revellers in Borough High Street, south London jumped on an ambulance car - smashing the windscreen and bonnet - and left it so badly damaged it is unable to respond to patients. Others climbed lampposts or Tube signs outside London Bridge station, and red smoke bombs were set off in the crowd. In Manchester city centre, fans jumped on top of a police van, while revellers in Birmingham climbed on top of a bus. Bus stops and car windows were smashed during celebrations in Nottingham.    And a horde of fans invaded an outlet of Swedish furniture giant IKEA in Stratford, east London where they jumped on a display bed, kicked cushions and chanted loudly as staff struggled to contain them. In the Clapham Junction incident, revellers invaded the street and brought traffic to a halt in St John\u0027s Hill after England went through to the World Cup semi-finals for the first time since 1990. Footage shows a man standing on top of the double-decker bus and swinging his arms as people chant and clap in the 30C heat.  The man jumps up and down, turns around and then leaps off the bus. He crashes through the glass roof of the bus stop and lands on a woman dressed in black. She and the man climb to their feet almost immediately as people move in to see if they are injured.  The incident unfolded around 6pm on Saturday as celebrations were well underway in cities across England, with fans dousing each other in beer, chanting and dancing in the streets. While most revellers were responsible, a few managed to spoil the fun with dangerous antics. Emergency services hit out at the disgraceful minority of England fans who marked the team\u0027s passage to the World Cup semi-finals with disorder. Sergeant Wayne Baker, with West Yorkshire Police, tweeted his disgust after pictures emerged of revellers dancing on top of an ambulance in central London.  He wrote: When I see behaviour like this it makes me anything but proud to be English .... You are a total disgrace. As for our National Football Team ... that does make me proud to be English! London Ambulance Service published images of the damage to the vehicle. They wrote: We\u0027re delighted with the result, but this has put a big dampener on the celebrations for us: while our officer attended a call nearby, this car was damaged in Borough High Street during the celebrations after the game, it\u0027s now off the road to be repaired. A spokesman for the Met said there had not been a spike in call-outs, despite the hysteria following England\u0027s victory over Sweden.

An emergency response vehicle was vandalised in London this evening after fans jumped on it and it is now unable to respond to patients. The Joint Response Unit tweeted: Obviously we are chuffed with this result this afternoon but there is absolutely NO excuse to vandalise emergency service3 vehicles by jumping on them.

Thousands of fans in Nottingham city centre could be seen flooding the streets after the match which saw England beat Sweden 2-0 reports Nottinghamshire Live. A number were seen climbing on top of buildings and swinging off of bus stops. Video footage also shows a handful of people on top of a building in the city centre waving their St George flags and chanting after the match was screened at Nottingham Castle.  Some fans may have had trouble getting home as the trams were unable to operate due to the sheer volume of people standing on the tracks. In frustration, some were seen punching and kicking the trams.  A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: There are no arrests in relation to the damage caused after the football at this time. “The damage was caused by an unknown offender but an investigation will take place in due course. “The car involved in the incident has been taken away.” Topless fans blocked off one of Hull\u0027s main roads and chanted \u0027It\u0027s coming home\u0027 after celebrating the win this afternoon.  Fans can be seen climbing onto the roof of a bus stop and a few fans even climbed on top of a van. And there have been huge crowds in London as fans celebrated across the capital.

Each has been left with physical scars in their fight against cancer. The wounds are a permanent reminder of their battle with an illness that kills over 177,000 people in the UK each year. But for each of the women, the scars are not a reason to hide away. They are a reason to stand tall. And they are a reason to celebrate. Celebrate not what they have lost, but what they have gained – a second chance at life. These \u0026shyinspirational women, helping promote Cancer Research UK Race for Life fundraisers, have also all been treated by the NHS – as it celebrates 70 years. Here are their amazing stories. Tasha  Conveyancy worker Tasha Jilka, 26, was diagnosed in 2010 with a rare facial cancer, olfactory neuroblastoma, when a tumour was discovered behind her left eye. Tasha, from Leicester, explained: “Surgeons had to cut from my ear to my eye to remove the tumour. At one point my eyelids were so swollen I could only see the world through slits in them. I also had radiotherapy, which doctors told me in late 2010 had destroyed the cancer, but the skin tissue was left damaged around my nose, causing it to collapse. “I had to wait two years to have my nose reconstructed while it all healed. The pain was so bad, there was even a time I wished I was dead. “When I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognise myself, it was very hard to take. Cancer also robbed me of my sense of smell. If I ever have children I will never know that lovely new baby smell. “But I know now that I need to live my life fully in memory of all the people who have suffered cancer. “I want to do it for me, and for them, because I have been given a second chance. We went to Dubai for my mum’s 50th in 2015 and that has inspired me. What motivates me is all the things I want to achieve. “I realised there are so many beautiful places to visit – like Hawaii, temples in Thailand – and I’m saving up to make those dreams come true.” Charlotte and Rose  Twins Charlotte and Rose Turpie lost their parents to cancer and had double mastectomies when they discovered they were carrying a timebomb gene. BRCA2 increases the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers and the sisters, 29, decided to take no chances. Veterinary nurse Charlotte, from Belper, Derbys, said: “We were just three when our mum, Sally, was told she had breast cancer. She lived another seven years but died when she was 39. “We were only 10. But the longer I live without her, the harder certain times are. She won’t be there for my wedding, nor birthdays. But out of something so difficult came something positive. We’ve wondered why she had breast cancer at such a young age. But a year before her death experts discovered the BRCA2 gene mutation and they could identify what took her so young. Doctors told us we should get tested and we both came back as being positive.” Sales co-ordinator Rose, who lives in the Peak District village of Chinley, said: “That’s when we decided to have our breasts removed, in 2016. We had initial surgery days apart. Charlotte was at the Derby Royal and I was at Wythenshawe Hospital. “I had breast tissue removed and implants straight away. Charlotte had a mastectomy and had implants a year later. “We both really struggled afterwards with body confidence.  “But then our dad, Paul, died. He was diagnosed with lung cancer and was gone less than two weeks after our surgeries. “It was hell. I can’t describe how dark a place it was to be in. “That is why we are trying to change our futures. I’m proud to show my scars. They give people hope. They don’t define you. “I’m now more body confident than ever. I spend a lot of time in the gym as it’s a great way to stay positive and helps me feel more confident about the way I look. “One of the best moments was standing side-by-side with my sister when we went to a charity ball in November 2017. I felt lovely in a ball gown and it was special to be able to share that with her.” Charlotte added: “That was the first time I’d worn a revealing dress. Rose dressed me and the criss-cross design across my boobs was something I’d never have worn before my surgery. “But I felt empowered and took confidence from being with my sister. It was wonderful to be able to share that after everything.” Maxine  Mum Maxine Turley was diagnosed with rare rhabdomyosarcoma cancer in 1984 – when she was aged just 12. A lump behind her eye that was thought to be caused by an allergy turned out to cancerous. Radiotherapy destroyed the tissue in her eyes and, 17 years later, she made the difficult decision to have her left eye removed. Office administrator Maxine, from Poulton-le-Fylde, near Blackpool, is now 46 – and counting her blessings. She said: “I didn’t know at the time, but I only had a 30 per cent chance of surviving. I missed loads of school. “My parents, naturally, tried to protect me from the truth. This year marks 25 years of Race for Life and in that time over eight million women have participated, raising over \u0026pound820m for Cancer Research UK.  The money raised at Race for Life has helped put Cancer Research UK at the heart of progress that has seen survival in the UK double in the last forty years. Maxine, Tasha, Rose and Charlotte have all taken part in Race for Life events, with Tasha and Maxine even doing speeches on the main stages to inspire others with their stories of cancer survival.  There are over 400 Race for Life events running from May to October, including 5k routes, 10k, a half-marathon, hikes and Pretty Muddy the 5k and 10k obstacle course.

Louis will wear a replica of the silk and lace christening gown worn by royal babies since 1841. The original was commissioned by Queen Victoria for her daughter Victoria, and made by Scottish dressmaker Janet Sutherland.  It was based on Queen Victoria\u0027s own wedding dress, and was made of Spitalfields silk and Honiton lace. The original was worn by 62 royal babies, including then-Princess Elizabeth - now the Queen - for her christening at Buckingham Palace in 1926.

Already faced with prices soaring by more than \u0026pound1,000 during the school holiday peak, lone parents say the \u0026shyadditional hike can make it impossible to take their children away. And operators such as Jet 2, Tui and First Choice can make the problem worse – as offers of free child places only apply if two paying adults travel with them. Single parent groups say the policy is “unfair” and “out of touch”. We found a one week all-inclusive stay at Bulgaria’s SuneoClub Odessos, \u0026shyflying from Manchester on July 27, costs \u0026pound1,572 for two adults with a free child’s place via First Choice.  But for just one adult and one child, the price is exactly the same. When selecting one adult, the ad for free child places disappears from the site. Airtours offers “child prices” for some hotels – but only when sharing a room with at least two adults paying full price. Thomas Cook Holidays has the same pricing policy. And because the firms do not count children in the room rate, a single parent can be charged an under-occupancy supplement. But it is not just accommodation – other firms also hit single parents with increased fares. A First Choice holiday to the Holiday Village Rhodes for seven nights cost an extra \u0026pound515 per person for a single adult with one child.

But as nice as it is to have stolen the Australian summer, us Brits just aren\u0027t used to coping with sudden rises in temperature. Still, all it really takes is a bit of preparation. Here are our tips for keeping comfortable and safe in this glorious weather. Now get out there and enjoy! Hydrate early, hydrate often    Your body is two-thirds water and you need to keep it topped up. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll get headaches and may also be more tired than usual. Hydration is, as most things are, even more important for little ones. According to the British Nutrition Foundation children are less heat tolerant than adults and have a higher percentage of water in their bodies. They\u0027re also tricky little monkeys who rarely remember to drink unless reminded. The key then, is going to be making it fun to grab a drink. If you have an outdoor power socket in your garden then connect up the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) and fill it with drinks. That way your kids can get their own chilled drink - they\u0027ll love this. You can just as easily put the coolbox inside if you don\u0027t have an outdoor power outlet. Alternatively, if you If you are planning to be out and about, you can also charge the cooler from your car\u0027s 12v power outlet. Make staying hydrated even more fun for the kids with a set of plastic Rainbow Tumblers, \u0026pound3 (half price).  Be skin-savvy Being outside in the sunshine is enjoyable, but its UV rays can do lasting damage to your skin. Applying a high SPF sun cream is vital - but it\u0027s also best to avoid exposing your skin to direct sun for prolonged periods, especially between midday and 3pm, when the sun is strongest. This is especially important for kids. So with a cloudless, beautiful summer sky you\u0027re going to need to create some shade. If you\u0027re at the beach, then a dedicated shelter will help. Halfords\u0027 Beach Shelter offers a 30+ UV protection. If you\u0027re spending most of the day out in the garden and the kids are in and out of the paddling pool, you may need more protection. The Halfords 300 Gazebo costs just \u0026pound69 ( was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21) and has a UV 50+ rating.  When choosing a gazebo or shelter for the sunny weather it\u0027s worth understanding those UV protection numbers. With a 50+ rating the gazebo should stop around 97 to 98 per cent of the UV radiation from the sun. This, combined with sun cream will help keep you all much safer. With any gazebo you might also want to consider some weights to go along with it. Just because it\u0027s sunny, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t also be a bit blowy out! Baby, it\u0027s hot outside The hot weather can feel uncomfortable for adults, but it\u0027s particularly important to keep babies in the shade - as they are less able to sweat to cool down and their skin is very sensitive. So it\u0027s worth investing in a stroller or pram with a decent sun visor if you are taking your little one out and about in the sun.  The Joie Mirus Scenic Stroller, \u0026pound120, is an affordable modern stroller which comes with a SPF 50+ sun canopy. (It can also be paired with either the Joie Gemm or Joie Juva Infant Car Seat, to create a travel system, with no adapter needed.)  For playing in the garden or trips to the beach, grab the Halfords Infant Playshade, \u0026pound25. It pops up and down in less than 10 seconds and is made from specially tested material that provides a 50+ UV protection factor. Stay cool in the car  It\u0027s fair to say we love most things about summer, but getting into a hot car on a sweltering day isn\u0027t one of them. Did you know your air conditioning loses charge every year, making it less efficient and making your car warmer? Halfords now offers a FREE Air Con Check, to check your refrigerant levels and see if they need to be topped up for optimal performance. If they do need topping up, you can purchase air con essentials from store to recharge at home or, you can book in for an air con recharge service and Halfords can take care of it for you. You can also keep out the worst of the heat by investing in a windscreen shield to reflect the sun\u0027s glare. The Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield is just \u0026pound7.99 - and when winter eventually does roll around, you can also use it to protect against the build up of snow and frost.

Doing it together is what kept us going.  “Seeing my gorgeous slim twin sister is a constant reminder not to overeat. It’s the best incentive we could both have.” The sisters put on weight after their dad died unexpectedly in 2007. Kirsty, who lives in Wrexham with husband Matt, 35, said: “Lindsey and I were both devastated when we lost our dad and we ate our way through our grief, trying to get comfort from it. Our weight rocketed. “Then when I gave birth to my daughter Olivia, now nine, my weight went up even further. Our weight was making us both miserable. Whenever we got together we’d commiserate over a giant pizza. We were fat but at least we had each other.”  At their heaviest, Kirsty weighed 16st 4lb and Lindsey weighed 17st 9lb. Then Kirsty had a heart attack when she was 25 weeks pregnant with son Evan, now four, in 2013. She said: “Thankfully I was all right and Evan was born healthy. But doctors discovered the heart attack was caused by a genetic blood clotting condition Lindsey and I shared. “They said my weight was a contributing factor. So we had to do something about it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle hasnt adopted english","story":"NewsMeghan Markle hasn\u0027t adopted an English accent - it\u0027s actually a clever mind trickFans of the Duchess of Sussex recently thought her voice sounded different, but as a leading linguist points out, this is impossible\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience EditorZoe ForseyAudience Writer17:21, 7 JUL 2018Updated17:47, 7 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSince her wedding back in May, Meghan Markle has barely put a foot wrong.  This is quite an achievement. Becoming a duchess isn\u0027t just about wearing expensive designer threads and accepting flowers from cute kids (though that is a large part).  There\u0027s all the rules she must now follow as the Duchess of Sussex, and it\u0027s a big leap from Hollywood to one of the most famous and traditional families in the world. So you can\u0027t hold it against her for wanting to fit in.  Recently it even seemed as if the Suits actor had adopted an English accent .  It\u0027s not the first time Meghan\u0027s accent has come under scrutinty.   Earlier this year she was accused of putting on British accent after saying the word \u0027scone\u0027 .  A new clip which recently emerged from her visit to Cheshire with the Queen, has convinced royal fans that they can hear a change in her voice. Meghan is speaking with well-wishers and shaking their hands, when one woman says: Welcome to Chester. She replies Thank you, I really appreciate that with the \u0027thank you\u0027 in particular sounding very British. But that\u0027s apparently not the case.  If we do think Meghan sounds more English, then that\u0027s down to us - not her. Professor of linguistics at Oklahoma State University, Dennis Preston, reveals that any perceived change is in fact down to our brain playing tricks on us.  She married an Englishman, she lives in England, she\u0027s hanging with the Queen, and people think, \u0027Gosh, she must be doing something with her language,\u0027 he told Yahoo .     Essentially, our brain gets in the way of our ear. So we hear what we expect to hear, rather than what we actually do. He went on: I did a very careful listen, paying specific attention to her vowels, a big giveaway with British accents, as well as the intonation. I just didn’t find anything resembling a British accent. There’s nothing there.

Lesley Hutchings says she had her passport taken away and her bank accounts emptied after being held for four days over allegations of defrauding customers. Lesley, 54, was quizzed by French authorities about the cream – which she makes in her barn. The product sells on Facebook for up to \u0026pound40. Police who raided her home in the remote Manche area of Nor\u0026shymandy removed computers and paperwork before sealing up the outbuilding. Officials then took away samples of her MAFactive cream for tests. Lesley – a former accountant who has no formal medical qualifications – says two of the creams have been ruled “satisfactory”, while a third is still being analysed.  Police also quizzed her over her association with David Noakes, who is facing trial over a controversial product called GcMAF – which his company promotes as the “body’s way of becoming cancer free”. Noakes is due in court in the UK later this year on charges of money laundering and manufacturing a medicine without a licence. When the Sunday People visited Lesley at her home, which she hopes to turn into a vegan B\u0026ampB, she insisted her cream does not contain GcMAF, despite the similar name. Lesley told us: “It’s just a name. What difference does it make? It could mean anything – multi-formula cream or whatever.” And she accused the French authorities of victimising her because she once worked with Noakes. Lesley said: “I ran a legitimate business with zero complaints from customers and positive feedback. “I don’t tell people my cream cures cancer. I don’t make any health claims. It’s not illegal to make something amazing – and it’s not illegal for others to tell the world you’ve made something amazing. One Polish woman wrote that she used my cream for tumours that had turned all fungal and said that three weeks later they were gone.  “I don’t even understand why my creams work because science says they shouldn’t work.” Lesley moved to France in 2011 after quitting her job with Noakes, which involved collating customer feedback on GcMAF. She began making her own cream three years ago. Claiming its exact contents are “a trade secret”, she would say only that it contains frankincense and yeast. Her Facebook page promoting the product stated it may help the body “defend itself against pathogens and cancers”. Facebook declined to comment on Lesley using the social networking site to promote her business. She says her business came under scrutiny by French authorities after she posted customer feedback to a private page – including the claims of the woman who said the cream had got rid of skin tumours. Lesley’s premises were raided in February last year – and she is still on bail. She said: “When I got out of prison my passport had been taken away, the banks had been cleared out and I was \u0026pound3,000 overdrawn. “I went from having a wonderful business I loved working in, even though I was doing 70 hours a week, to having it ripped out from under me and being bankrupt – all without a single day in court. This is French justice.  “I don’t feel I’d want to support France any more, a country so abusive to human rights. It’s comparable to Turkey.” On a Facebook page to promote her cream she writes: “This not only ensures healthy skin, but may also help to enable the body to fight off infections, repair and renew its cells and defend itself against pathogens and cancers.” Lesley’s daughter Jasmin raised \u0026pound10,000 from a crowdfunding page to help pay her mum’s legal fees. She said people had described the cream as “almost supernatural”. After her home was raided Lesley was taken to Paris, where a judge questioned her association with Noakes, who claims GcMAF can cure cancer. The so-called miracle drug contains a vitamin D binding protein called glycoprotein, which it is claimed boosts the immune system to help the body fight cancer naturally. Small clinical trials in Japan were dismissed by other experts as they did not take scans of patients’ tumours or analyse their immune systems. But online enthusiasts insist it is a “miracle cure” that is being suppressed by drugs manufacturers. The unlicensed drug is banned in the UK. GcMAF is marketed by Noakes’s Guernsey-based company, Immuno Biotech. The firm’s website claims GcMAF treats a range of conditions, from allergies and asthma to Crohn’s disease, HIV, Parkinson’s disease and autism.

The government is believed to be drawing up a new list of items that must be put in the hold. It comes after Australia, the US and New Zealand introduced similar bans last month. They adopted the new rules after Australian officials were rocked by a foiled plot to blow up an Ethiad flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi last year. Islamic State sent the sophisticated device from Syria to a terror cell in Sydney hidden in a meat mincer.  A major terror attack may only have been averted when the suitcase was abandoned at check-in, possibly because it was too heavy. The Times reports that the new rules could bring powders under the same restrictions as liquids. All powders would be restricted to 12 ounces or 56 grams and would have to go through further security checks. The rule on liquids were introduced in the wake of 9/11. However, there are fears the new rules could mean even longer lines at airport security. It comes amid worries that the new UK passports, which are blue in colour, will increase queues at border control. The Department of Transport did not comment on The Times\u0027 report.  A spokesman said: It is for each country to determine its own security measures based on its own assessments. We work closely with all our international partners to keep aviation security under constant review. Mils Hills, an associate professor in risk, resilience and corporate security at the University of Northampton, said: In itself, these extra restrictions are not going to create a lot of disruption at airport security but it has the potential to feed into general concerns by the public about the safety of flying.

A colossal \u0026pound10 billion worth of badly performing SIPPs - Self Invested Personal Pensions - are believed to have been mis-sold to hundreds of thousands of Brits by unscrupulous financial advisors. Now potential victims are being urged to check if they can reclaim huge portions of their lost cash and the government has set up a special \u0026pound120 million fund to compensate losers so far. A maximum \u0026pound50,000 compensation sum is currently available from the large fund managed by The Financial Service Compensation Scheme and the figure is set to rise by 75 per cent to a \u0026pound85,000 maximum in the next nine months as claims grow. However industry figures such as pension expert Zoe Pearson warn that the true cost of mis-sold pensions is closer to \u0026pound10 billion and will sweep the country like the current phenomenon of PPI claims that has gripped the nation over the past few years.  Read more: Taxed to death: The astonishing amount of income tax people pay decades after leaving work for the last time Miss Pearson, who heads the country’s all female team of claim specialists Pension Claim Consulting Ltd , told : “Thousands upon thousands of people are unaware they’ve been mis-sold SIPPS. Unless you know what to look for it’s difficult to know what a mis-sale is although quite often when people realise they’ve been mis-sold to, they’re too embarrassed to take action. “However, the financial services industry has firm rules, so any mis-sale should be pursued. “Even basic calculations give you an idea of the true scale of this scandal. Average compensation for mis-sales sit at around \u0026pound25,000 for private pensions and \u0026pound50,000 for final salary pensions so the total figure for the mis-sales of SIPPs is going to be around the \u0026pound10bn mark. “In fact if this was brought to the forefront and the government advised people to check the status of their pensions that might even be an underestimation. The government needs to launch an investigation to unearth the true amount.” Labour MP Frank Field has hit out at the SIPP conmen and vowed to bring the industry into line whilst industry experts reveal the true figure of mis-selling is growing at an unprecedented rate and the true loss of mis-selling will run into billions as the number of victims rocket.  Shocking 30.4million Brits face disappointment when they finally get to stop working - the plan to fix it The Financial Ombudsman however are allowed to raise their compensation ceiling and can award up to a further maximum of \u0026pound150,000 for many cases. The SIPP scams involved unscrupulous Financial Advisors preying on savers who were promised massive returns of up to 20 per cent a year only for their savings to be squandered on get rich quick schemes including investing in airport parking, holiday properties and green energy projects. The Financial Conduct Authority revealed one in eight savers think an advisor has mis-sold them a financial product such as a pension. The FCA advise people who think they have been mis-sold a pension to raise a complaint as soon as possible as there are time-limits in place which could affect the outcome of your claim. Their report called the Financial Lives Survey was widely praised by industry experts who believe that the government have underestimated the scale of mis-sold pensions such as SIPPs however the Commons Work and Pensions Committee have demanded tighter safeguards to protect savers. Committee Chairman Frank Field MP said: “I am concerned about the role of SIPPs as platforms that help funnel unwitting clients’ pension savings into dodgy and inappropriate investments. SIPPs are happy to skim off their fee on the way but there are serious questions about their commitment to due diligence and consumer protection. “When an unscrupulous financial advisor channels a victim’s money through a SIPP into an investment that then collapses, it is not enough for the SIPP provider to shrug their shoulders and say ‘caveat emptor’. “I will be writing to the FCA to ask what they are doing to ensure SIPPS are not acting as handmaidens to the pension-snatchers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"owners urged check dogs eyes","story":"NewsOwners urged to check their dogs’ eyes or risk them going blindDry eyes is a common condition that can lead to infections, ulcers and even eyes being removed – but only half of ­owners are aware of it\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRachel Spencer19:06, 7 JUL 2018NewsA dog with dried eyes\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOwners are being urged to check their dogs’ eyes or risk them going blind.

Nicole Paprotny, 30, had to have both her pet’s eyes removed after he was diagnosed. Nicole said: “It was \u0026shyheartbreaking. It was a last resort to get my happy \u0026shypuppy back.” The first symptom her \u0026shylabrador boxer cross Scully showed was conjunctivitis. Despite various treatments, he stopped producing tears. He had \u0026shysurgery to direct his salivary glands to his eyes but this failed so he lost his left eye. Then, two months later, the condition hit his right eye.  Nicole, a vet nurse from Tranent, near Edinburgh, chose to lose the eye rather than have him put to sleep. She said: “Scully now navigates his way around home with his sense of smell and senses where \u0026shyobstacles are.” One in five vulnerable breeds and one in 20 of all dogs suffer with dry eye at some stage in their life. Symptoms include eyes appearing red and sore, repeated cases of \u0026shyconjunctivitis, excessive blinking or eye rubbing, discharge and eyes \u0026shyhaving a dry and dull appearance. Trendy breeds such as pugs and bulldogs with eyes that pop out are more at risk, as are cocker and cavalier King Charles spaniels, westies, and pekingese pups.

There\u0027s a whole host of foods they can no longer eat, they can\u0027t drink and they will sometimes have to give up the hobbies they love. But there\u0027s one thing Pippa Middleton, who is expecting her first child with husband James Matthews, is refusing to give up despite that growing baby bump.   Writing in her column for Waitrose Weekend , the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s little sister, 34, explains why she is still playing tennis.  She said: I\u0027ve been a tennis fan since childhood, as player and spectator, and have been keen to continue playing safely throughout pregnancy. Take Serena Williams – she famously proved that women can play a high level of tennis from two months (when she won the 2017 Australian Open) up to eight months. Few of us can relate to this elite excellence, but if you\u0027re a healthy, well-trained player with an uncomplicated pregnancy there\u0027s no reason why you can\u0027t continue a good level of tennis.  It is believed Pippa is due in October. And it\u0027s not just playing which Pippa enjoys, and she\u0027s a regular at Wimbledon. She was in the crowds for day four of this year\u0027s competition with her brother James.

Catherine Purcell, 68, died while being eaten alive and lying in a “cesspit of her own faeces and bodily fluid” at the home she shared with her daughter in Kirkby, Liverpool .  This week, her husband John Purcell, 72, and 35-year-old daughter Catherine Purcell junior, 35, were given suspended jail sentences for neglecting the disabled great-grandmother.  Prosecutors said the great-grandmother\u0027s bed was so soiled it had been chemically destroyed by her own bodily fluids, the Liverpool Echo reported.   David McLachlan, QC, prosecuting, said this reaction burned the skeletal victim’s skin and her infected body was then fed on by maggots. He argued during that the pair knew she was dying, but failed to seek medical aid, which three weeks beforehand would have saved her life. During the harrowing trial into the death of Mrs Purcell, Mr McLachlan read out messages exchanged between Purcell junior and her sister Kellie, who had not visited the house for six months and was not charged with any offences. The messages were sent days before the pensioner died on July 11, 2016, and included Purcell junior likening her mum to a pig lying in s***.  One message read: Ye girl co dad said fore to just ignore her for a bit and let her do with put cuppa tea and biffs let’s see if she’ll give in that way but every time one of us walk in she gets worse surly she can smell it in her f***ing hands when she smoking Oh I jus don’t know what to do coz she can’t walk so I can’t even get her to the bath room to giv her a bath and no matter what way we look at her were gona end up with this all over use as well even if she could walk she’s gonna have us plasted in s*** as well she’s just not assed to say the least girl either she isn’t a bit bothered that she’s like that she licks off if we tell he to at least wash her hands to eat her tea etc. She f***ing flipped on dad av few times now coz she’s had to get wash she like pig lying in her Own s*** descusting I feel like f***ing dragging her by the head and f***ing throwing her in the f***ing bath tats how bad she is girl.  In one text, Kellie Purcell asked: Have u sorted little room yet girl I got bedding for single and double here just finishing sorting curtain now sweat p***ing out of me like tap carnt breath \u0026amp I stink. Her sister replied: No have I f*** girl I can’t be assed what’s the point am going to jail any how so dads keeps telling me. The f***ing point is it needs doing oh I be round in morning, came the reply. Other messages appeared to show Kellie Purcell offering to help out but being repeatedly ignored by her sister.  And she lashed out at her sibling in another message, accusing her of pure laziness for not helping their mum. She wrote: I agree about mum if use would of let Carers in u would have been better but the state the house is in cath and me mum got f*** all to do with not being able to cope it pure laziness. A post-mortem examination found Mrs Purcell died from pneumonia, dehydration and skin ulcers, including a hip ulcer penetrating to the bone.  The victim, who weighed just five and a half stone, also had undiagnosed cancer of the tongue, which would have made swallowing painful. Mr Purcell claimed he didn’t realise his wife was “severely malnourished”, or her stained legs covered in sores, despite changing her clothes. He accepted her bedroom was “disgraceful”, but said he didn’t know it was that filthy until she died, because the bed was covered by a duvet.

Del Naja - known as 3D - is a pal of the hip hop star and they were both graffiti artists in the same circles in the late 1980s. In the podcast Goldie is ranting about how the art industry is cashing in on Banksy. He says: Give me a bubble letter and put it on a t-shirt and write \u0027Banksy\u0027 on it and we\u0027re sorted.

Thousands of products – including pasta, biscuits, crisps and cake bars – past their “best before” dates are being snapped up at bargain prices. The new service is operated by Fultons Foods, which hopes it will reduce the amount of perfectly usable produce that gets binned. An astonishing seven million tonnes of food is thrown away in the UK every year, of which three-\u0026shyquarters, or five million tonnes, could still have been safely eaten. Family-run Fultons, which is based in Barnsley, South Yorks, operates 100 stores in the Midlands and North. It sells surplus stock direct from manufacturers at “significantly” lower prices than supermarkets.  The firm’s Karen Gunter said: “An increasing number of UK householders are saving hundreds of pounds by taking advantage of the reality of best before dates. These products are perfectly fine to eat.” “Best before” is a manufacturer’s indication that an item may not be as good quality, but it is not unsafe. Bargains include roast chicken and pasta Mug Shot down from 84p to 29p, Galaxy cake bars down from \u0026pound1 to 79p, bottles of 7 Up lemonade down from \u0026pound1.10 to 59p, and Golden Wonder salt and vinegar crisps from 79p to 50p.  Deliveries, which are made by couriers, are free for groceries costing \u0026pound30 or over. Online retailer Approved Food runs a similar scheme offering 2,000 items near or past “best before” dates. It claims regular customers can save \u0026pound70 on their monthly shop compared to high street prices. The firm’s biggest-selling items include tinned tomatoes and pasta.

The man - dressed in a blue top and shorts and evidently bursting with pride - clambers on top of a double decker bus and can be seen in a video swinging his arms chanting \u0027ooh ooh.\u0027 He encourages the crowd to join in as he leads the celebrations.  There are cheers as he and another man, dressed in a red top, dance on top of the double deck bus and nearby bus stop roof. And they can be seen swinging their arms, jumping and dancing as they soak up the atmosphere - until the man in blue leaps from the bus onto the bus stop and smashes through the glass roof. The clapping stops and gasps can be heard as he lands smack on the concrete in his side. But miraculously in true Brit style he gets up and walks it off. The glass roof is left hanging, while the man in red - still on the top of the bus stop - appears to question how he can get down safely and avoid the same fate as his pal.  The video which has been posted online has received mixed reactions. One person said: Love how he got up and styled it out, nothing to see here!! Another added: How did he just walk it off. While Brian Kane wrote: The guy with the hat just keeps on clapping as if nothing happened. However, some think he\u0027s gone too far.  Meanwhile, in Southampton a man has been caught surfing across three MOVING double decker buses to celebrate England\u0027s win.

Claire Greenley, 35, even said police would have a fight on their hands and the street would help out when she was told officers were on their way to rescue the children. Hull Crown Court heard how the youngsters who were in Ms Greenley\u0027s care were left in squalid conditions with human excrement smeared on the sink, windows, walls and stairs. The children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were found to have suffered emotional and psychological harm and are now recovering, reports Hull Live.   Megan Rhys, prosecuting, said when authorities visited the east Hull property last year, the garden was strewn with furniture and rubbish from split black bin bags. The real horrors were inside the house, where Greenley was found unkempt and smelling unpleasant, as if she had not been looking after herself. The house was filled with bags and piles of dirty clothes, to the point where it was difficult to find floor space not covered by rubbish. The bathroom door was off its hinges, and inside was a 2.5ft high pile of soiled clothing. The floor was barely visible, Miss Rhys said. There was faecal matter on the sink unit and three to four human stools on the stairs, which had dried and clearly been there for some time and stepped in. The visitors also found faeces smeared on the wall of a bedroom.  An upstairs window and the letter box had also been smeared with excrement, the court heard. An inspector said it was the worst property he\u0027d seen in ten years. Miss Rhys said: It\u0027s difficult to say how long the property had been in that state. It\u0027s clearly not something that had happened overnight. When Greenley was interviewed by police, she accepted the house was uninhabitable. Greenley, who had no previous convictions, later admitted child cruelty offences. Cathrine Kioko-Gilligan, mitigating, said Greenley had previously been the victim of domestic violence, and suffered mental health problems after the breakdown of that relationship.  Her home became unmanageable and she was too ashamed and embarrassed to seek assistance. Sentencing Greenley, Judge David Tremberg said the house was comprehensively unfit for human habitation, and was squalid and unkempt from top to bottom, with the smell and presence of faeces about the place.

Nadine Hanlon, 43, and husband Lee, 40, put the World Cup on a big screen next to the top table while they enjoyed their wedding breakfast.   The couple, who live in Rutland, have been married for 21 years and were renewing their vows in Yorkshire on Saturday, but Nadine - who wore a full wedding dress for the ceremony - wasn\u0027t going to let that stop her from supporting the team.  She said: It\u0027s a great day because we\u0027ve renewed our vows but even better than that, it\u0027s topped off - England won. The boys are bringing it back home.  I knew they were going to win, I have faith. Asked why she was determined to screen the match during her special day, she said: Because I can\u0027t function without watching the game. I love the man, but footballs comes first. However, Nadine - who has an Arsenal tattoo on her leg - is far more enthusiastic about the game than her soldier husband Lee. It\u0027s the wrong shaped ball. He\u0027s a rugby guy, she said.

The England coach told friends he thought we stood a much better chance in 2022 in Qatar. He knew he was fielding a young, inexperienced squad up against teams who had more international caps under their belts. But he said there was one thing his players had going for them. All they ever wanted to do was go out there and play football. Their heads had not been turned by the trappings of fame, and their minds were fixed on the beautiful game. The lads have played football more beautifully than anyone could have dreamed of. To beat the England curse of the penalty shootout would have been enough for them to return home as heroes. To beat Sweden 2-0 in yesterday’s quarter-finals made them superheroes.  The squad some thought wouldn’t get out of their group will now go forward to the first semi-final with England in it since 1990. It is a magnificent achievement, and gave a nation worn down by the angst of austerity and the boredom of Brexit a spring in its step. Or as the BBC so soberly put it, Harry Maguire’s header “sent them batty in Birmingham” and Dele Alli’s goal “bonkers on Brighton beach”. And the England team has done it with such good manners, courtesy and sportsmanship, they are a credit to their country and an example to the world. Put heat on Putin Now we can dare to dream of England in another World Cup final – an event the prime minister and a senior royal would be expected to attend. Not this time. Not with Dawn Sturgess lying unconscious in hospital kept alive on a ventilator. Dawn and boyfriend Charlie Rowley were the innocent victims of one of Vladimir Putin’s death squads. An assassination team operating on British soil clearly still contaminated with their vicious poison. We accept that Mr Putin has staged a well-managed World Cup.

Maya Merhi, eight, is smiling, in good health and learning to walk again following her life-changing treatment, which a doctor carried out for free after learning of her plight. The youngster was born without legs due to a rare congenital condition which her father Mohammed Merhi also has. The 34-year-old used the tuna cans and tubes as make-shift legs to protect his daughter at the refugee camp they fled to after fighting forced them from their home in Aleppo province.  It meant instead of crawling everywhere and being confined to a tent, Maya was finally able to walk outside and even attend the camp\u0027s school. Pictures of her wearing the tuna cans were seen around the world and it prompted such a reaction that the Turkish Red Crescent intervened and the father and daughter were evacuated from Idlib and brought to Istanbul for treatment.  Dr Mehmet Zeki Culcu, a prosthetics specialist who provided the life-changing treatment for free, told Al Jazeera it may take Maya up to three months to gain full mobility, but she will walk.  He added that her father\u0027s handiwork was good practise and helped to get her used to walking rather than crawling all the time. Maya\u0027s dad, who has five other children none of whom suffer from the condition, said he replaced the plastic tubing once a month and the tins once a week.

Dundee paid the price for that gamble by failing to get out of a group they had been expected to win comfortably and, ultimately, it was a factor in Hartley losing his job.Under McCann, the policy has been that the Betfred is an important event and it’s first game, not the league kick-off next month, marks the start of the season proper. That’s fine by his vice-captain.“I personally came back feeling really fit and I think as you’ve seen the rest of the boys look really fit as well,” he said.“You can kind of gauge first day back when we do a lot of testing. Everyone is a bit anxious because eyes are on you but this has been the fittest group of boys I’ve seen.“Everyone has a sharpness about them. I don’t know if it’s the modern game and the demands there are on you but everyone has been bang at it.“For me the Betfred two years ago gave me a shock. I remember speaking about it. That season we were straight into the competitive games and you are expected to win them but it doesn’t go that way because that’s football and you have to be ready.“That’s why to get the couple of games we’ve had has been massive and to get away (to Portugal), do some training and have another couple of games is massive as well.”Dundee are now in the Algarve where they’ll do more work and face SC Farense on Tuesday. Kerr’s sure that’ll have them ready for the Betfred tie at Stirling Albion Saturday week.“I enjoy being away. I’ve been to Hungary twice and Austria during pre-season and it’s good for the team.“You get to know the new boys who’ve come because you are together all the time and that’s important. We’re doing two sessions a day, eating meals together and spending time together at night as well.“That’s important because when you have new team-mates you can’t just go out on a pitch and gel right away. It takes work and time.”With the cup games looming large, Kerr feels the time away is also a chance to prepare properly.“We’re back in the middle of next week and then right into the first tie on the Saturday, so we can do a bit of work for that as well as the general stuff we’ve been doing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"creators of famous viking centre in york to open new exhibit in tayside","story":"\t\t\t\t\tVikings will invade the local area this summer with an exhibition featuring a 15ft boat, a skeleton and a replica ancient Nordic house being staged at Perth Museum.Vikings: Fearsome Craftsmen explores the day-to-day lives of the formidable Norse warriors and the interactive event will introduce visitors to the Viking way of life, including their craft skills.Those who attend the exhibition, which is being run by the creators of the famous Jorvik Viking Centre in York, can also enjoy seeing a 15ft replica Viking fishing boat and an ancient excavated Viking skeleton.Helen Smout, chief executive of Culture Perth and Kinross, urged residents and visitors to “seize the opportunity” to experience what she feels will be a “hit” summer event.She said: “The team at Perth Museum and Art Gallery and across Culture Perth and Kinross have braced ourselves for a very welcome Viking invasion.“The Jorvik Viking Centre is a fantastic step into another time and we are delighted to be hosting an interactive exhibit from the same team, right here in the heart of Scotland.“We look forward to welcoming visitors who have an interest in these incredibly intelligent and creative Norse warriors, and those who are curious to learn more about them in a fun family-friendly environment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f32d41f02e.jpg ","title":"dad of three luke 34 cured of diabetes after 22 years thanks to double transplant","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA dad-of-three says he feels like a “different person” after receiving a double transplant.Luke Chapman, 34, was given a new kidney and pancreas, having suffered from type 1 diabetes for 22 years and then developed kidney disease.He said that since the operation, he has been cured of the condition – and paid tribute to the staff who treated him for more than two decades.Pancreas and kidney transplants are carried out on patients with kidney disease. In Luke’s case, the new kidney has taken over from his own, which hadn’t worked properly since he was diagnosed.In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make enough insulin, a hormone that controls the blood sugar level in your body. The transplanted pancreas can make insulin and correct this type of diabetes.Luke, an electrician from Montrose, said: “I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 12. I took insulin to control that since I was diagnosed.“Unfortunately, my kidney function dropped quite badly and in 2014 I was diagnosed with kidney disease, and started dialysis in 2016.“I was put on dialysis three days a week, which was quite gruelling. The last two years, on the dialysis, it was a struggle, and started to disrupt my life.“I was still managing to work but I was tired all the time. I was limited to one litre of fluid a day, which is hard, and your diet is restricted as well. There was a large build-up of fluid in my body which is bad for your heart and puts you at risk of a heart attack.\u0026#8220I was on the waiting list for a kidney and pancreas transplant, but was taken off a couple of times, because there is strict criteria that you remain in good health.”Then, on June 2, Luke got a call at 3am telling him to get to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary as medics had found a donor – much to the relief of wife Vicky and children Luiza, 18, Finlay, six and three-year-old Frankie.He said: “In about 90% of cases with transplant, something goes wrong for some reason and the transplant doesn’t go ahead. But at 5.50pm, the doctor came and said, ‘that’s your pancreas here’.“They had harvested it first, before the kidney, but from the same donor. It’s strange because you never know if the day will come or not. It was surreal.“I’ve had diabetes for 22 years and now I’m cured. I feel like a different person. I was at the beach yesterday with my kids running around – I couldn’t have done that five weeks ago.“With keeping my full-time job I was going home and just feeling rotten and sleeping a lot. But my employer, WM Mustard \u0026amp Son Ltd has been fantastic with me.“I lost almost 10kg in three days after the operation. The new kidney needs time to be regulated by the body, so it was in overdrive, removing everything from my body.“I’m now starting to put weight back on.“I’m on about 22 tablets in the morning for various things. That will continue, but the dosage will drop after three and then six months.“But the prognosis is I can eat, drink or do what I want.“The treatment I have had from the NHS has been impeccable and the staff have been brilliant.”Luke has been told the age and sex of his donor, and will shortly be told how they died. He plans in due course to write to their family, thanking them.He added: “If anyone is thinking of signing up to be a donor, please do it.

Before heading west, the young centre-half turned out for his parent club in the friendly draw at Brechin last Friday.And watching on was a scout from an English Premier League outfit who had headed north to specifically have a look at him.While that’s unlikely to lead to an immediate move to take him south, his first few appearances at Morton are likely to be monitored.Should Waddell impress, there’s still the possibility an offer for him could be forthcoming before the transfer window closes at the end of next month.It would take a substantial offer to persuade Dundee to part with him.

It was not bad but I was prepared to see better because of how they have trained.“I have been very pleased with them so far.

The teams coming down will have an expectation to go straight back up.“Then there are teams that have been down there for a while that will have a real go at getting up.“I would probably goes as far as to be saying in Scotland right now it is the toughest league.“The Championship is the most competitive but we are a club that have ambitions and we are one I think should be in the Premiership. I think we can all agree on that.”That’s pretty much all he has to say on that last point. He knows the best place to show United’s intent won’t be in interviews but out on the pitch and by getting results.And as Csaba Laszlo’s new-look side gels, he’s confident that will be the case.“We need to do our talking on the pitch,” he added.“Hopefully, all the pieces will come together during the season and the goal is to get to the Premiership.“It is going to take time but the pre-season games and the Betfred Cup games before the league season starts are all preparation for the first game against Dunfermline.“And the Betfred Cup gives us competitive games before the season starts but at the end of the day it is part of our preparation for the start of the league.“It’s a lot better playing games than training all the time but we do want to go on a nice cup run as well.”The early signs up at Glebe Park were encouraging and Aird admits he was pleased with how things went for both himself and his new team-mates.“Obviously, I was delighted to get a run out and get the goal. It was my first game for Dundee United and it was great to get started.“It was a pre-season game and the big thing was to get minutes on the pitch and that was good.“And the goal was good for the confidence going forward.“It was the first time all the boys had played together and gave the manager the chance to have a look at us in a game rather than training.”While it goes without saying United have taken something of a gamble by making so many signings in one summer.There have already been nine new arrivals and the manager has revealed he’d like as many as another four before the Betfred Cup kicks off against Arbroath next week.Rather than being daunted by that, though, Aird is relishing the challenge of being part of what could be a completely new team.“It was a position when they signed nine new players that it was the rebuilding of a club.“The number of signings excited me.

at glebe park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew-look Dundee United looked good as they strolled to victory in the sunshine at Brechin on Tuesday night.Playing what could be the only public friendly of their build-up to the new campaign, the Tangerines started with eight of their nine summer signings.And all impressed as Csaba Laszlo’s men knocked the ball around well and breached the home defence on two occasions.Encouragingly for the several hundred fans who chose to escape England’s World Cup win over Colombia and made the journey to Glebe Park, there was a cohesion about United’s play that probably no one had a right to expect so early in the rebuilding process that’s been undertaken since the disappointment of missing out on promotion at the end of last season.What was apparent within a few minutes of kick-off was Laszlo has added strength and energy to his squad.From a defence that was well marshalled by Frederic Frans to a front line led ably by Craig Curran, the team looked sharp and powerful.Frans looks exactly the kind of dominant defender that was needed to replace Bilel Mohsni, who’d done so well during his short stay towards the end of last term.And out wide Callum Booth showed his Premiership quality at left-back, while Sam Wardrop on the right did enough to suggest he will be an able replacement for his former Celtic youth team-mate Anthony Ralston.In the middle of the park Austrian Christoph Rabitsch added bite, while ahead of him Curran and Nicky Clark showed good understanding for their first outing up front together.Elsewhere, wide man Fraser Aird was first to show what he can bring to the team when he picked up the ball 40 yards from goal and jinked his way past several challenges before netting with a low shot.That opener came with just seven minutes or so on the clock but already United were knocking the ball around in the manner their gaffer likes.It wasn’t just about the new boys, however, and the few familiar faces in the line-up gave a good account of themselves.Sam Stanton was his usual industrial self in midfield and used the ball well. Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Sunday 8 Jul 2018 11:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116501.jpg","title":"Full Monty act raises cash for Maggies Highland","story":"\u0026nbspBARING all for charity has paid off for a group of women raising money for and awareness of Maggie\u0027 Highland.More than \u0026pound6000 has been collected for the charity following a \"full monty\" show at the Mercure Hotel in Inverness.The majority of the women who stripped off on Sunday have experience of battling cancer themselves.As well as a fashion show, live music and a classy strip-tease, NHS nurses reminded women to check their breasts regularly and gave a demonstration using fake breasts.Organiser Sarah Jane Douglas of Ardersier said she was blown away by people\u0027 generosity.\"Hopefully we\u0026nbspinspired\u0026nbspour female audience to love their bodies for what they are.

first team.All of that money will be channelled back into manager Derek McInnes’ bid to bring success to Pittodrie both domestically and in Europe.AberDNA was launched in March this year and almost 5,500 fans have signed up to the initiative.The Evening Express can reveal the cash raised – with more than £1m gross taken in.Aberdeen have had a bid of around £500,000 turned down for Doncaster Rovers striker John Marquis.The Dons will have to shell out more than half-a-million to land Marquis even though Peterborough, who also had a bid rejected, are understood to be out of the race for the 26-year-old.The Reds have already splashed out £200,000 to land midfield playmaker Chris Forrester from Posh.On AberDNA, Milne, said: “Gross we have raised just over £1 million.“But there are obviously costs associated with that.“We lose 20% in VAT straight away.“There is the cost of running the team that is doing the selling job.“Then there is the cost of the products that are part of the DNA.“However, it will leave a sizeable chunk of money that will be fed into the football operation.“It will be in excess of half a million.“We would hope it would be on the right side of £600,000.”The entirely voluntary AberDNA scheme will continue to raise money to be funnelled into strengthening the team every season as the packages require monthly payments.There are four packages that come with various benefits – Premium (£18), Standard (£12), International (£18) and Under-12 (£8).Hearts run a similar scheme. Foundation of Hearts has more than 8,000 members and has raised more than £6.5 million.Hibs Supporters’ Limited has contributed £525,000 to the football budget.Milne said: “It has been a fantastic response from the fans and it just shows you the commitment out there from them.“Lots of them are buying season tickets and signing up for DNA.“It is a great initiative and will help strengthen that bond between the club and the fans.“It will enable the fans to feel that they are much more part of the club.“As time goes past that is something that can be developed even further.”Dons boss McInnes aims to strengthen his squad further before the Europa League second qualifying round first leg clash with Burnley on Thursday July 26.Doncaster’s stance is that Marquis is not for sale as he is the club’s leading scorer with40 goals in two seasons.He has two years left on his contract and sources indicate it would take a bid of close to £1m to test Doncaster’s resolve.That is likely to be far too rich for Aberdeen.McInnes has already introduced three new signings for the new campaign with Forrester, Republic of Ireland international Stephen Gleeson and teenage midfielder Lewis Ferguson.A training compensation fee has yet to be agreed between Aberdeen and Ferguson’s former club Hamilton.The Reds have offered in excess of £100,000 while Accies are understood to value the 18-year-old at around £900,000.The matter is set to go to an SPFL tribunal with a date still to be set.Aberdeen are confident the final figure will be close to their valuation.McInnes is also in the hunt for defensive cover before the start of the season that kicks off with the Euro clash with Burnley.Aberdeen then face Rangers in a Premiership opener on August 5 that will mark the domestic debut of new Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard.Milne said: “We know it is going to be a very challenging league this year.“Rangers are upping their game, Hearts have brought in a lot of new players and I have no doubt once Hibs get going there will be plenty of new players coming in there.“I do think it will be a very competitive league.“We have never had a period since Fergie left where we have effectively delivered so many second-placed finishes.“That is how close we have been for the last five years which is great testament to Derek and his backroom team and the players.“We still have the core of the players that will be part of that this coming season.“It is going to be a big challenge.”With such a competitive Premiership expected will there be recognition of that in McInnes’ budget?“Very much so,” said Milne. “Since Derek joined the club it has been part of growing the budget every year.“We have done various things over the years to help us generate additional cash.“Last year we got the Granite Club operating and this year we have the DNA membership scheme up and running.“The bulk of that additional cash we are trying to feed into the football budget.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen for all","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor defender Andy Considine the Dons are a team for the working class and every supporter, regardless of financial situation, should be able to see them in action.Although it’s the Oil Capital of Europe, the 30-year-old acknowledges there are many within the Granite City who are struggling with poverty.The economic downturn has hit the city hard and for some watching the Dons at Pittodrie is not a possibility.Which is why Considine is fully behind the club’s innovative Aberdeen for All scheme, which provides the use of season tickets to the most deserving in the community.Working alongside parent charity Aberdeen FC Community Trust, the Dons will identify families and individuals who will benefit most from the initiative.More than 500 season tickets were issued through Aberdeen for All last season and that is set to rise in the upcoming campaign following the donation of sponsors.Considine, who is set to face St Johnstone in a friendly in Perth tomorrow, said: “Aberdeen is a working-class city and football is a working-class game.“It has always been that way.Regardless of your situation you should be able to come and watch football.“This is a fantastic gesture from everyone involved.“Aberdeen has the oil but that has taken a huge hit over the last couple of years.“This can make a difference for many kids as it offers them the chance to come to a game on a Saturday.”Following Aberdeen’s 2-1 European Cup Winners’ Cup final win over Real Madrid in 1983, Bernabeu legend Alfredo Di Stefano, then Real manager, said “Aberdeen have what money can’t buy – a soul, a team spirit built in a family tradition.”For Considine that philosophy remains at the heart of the club which is why social inclusion for all is so fundamental to the Reds.A product of the Pittodrie youth system, he said: “Aberdeen have always had that family tradition.“This keeps everyone even closer as a community.“To see the smiles on young kids’ faces when they come to watch the football and watch potentially their idols, it is priceless.“It is a great experience for them and it might spur some of them on to become footballers like ourselves.“For a club like Aberdeen that relies on young people coming through the youth system to break into the first team, regardless of whether you have a bit of money or not, you should still be able to have that chance. You should still be able to have that opportunity to make it in football or any sport regardless of your situation.“This type of scheme is potentially getting people on that right track.”Following sponsorship from Aberdeen-based companies, the Dons will be able to reach more deserving families and local community groups via the scheme. The companies are Swire Oilfield Services, Burness \u0026amp Paull, Aberdeen Standard Investments and Simmons \u0026amp Co International.The initiative is also supported by Stewart Milne Group and the Cormack Foundations.Aberdeen FC Community Trust (AFCCT) already work with many charities and organisations throughout the city to provide support and opportunities.Considine believes there is a social responsibility for the Reds above and beyond what they do on the pitch.Asked if this expanded as far as donating to food banks he said: “There is one out at Banchory my wife and I have donated at a couple of times. I am sure there are plenty of others who have as well at Aberdeen.“People should be supporting these things.”Aberdeen For All is aimed at individuals in the local community who are in need due to a number of reasons such as social exclusion, financial hardship or other disadvantages.Ally Prockter, chief executive of AFC Community Trust said: “AFCCT is delighted to be working closely with Aberdeen FC in relation to their Aberdeen For All initiative.“Social inclusion is a serious challenge which can be overcome in many ways, and for many people it is important they feel as if they are part of something bigger.“Providing AFC match tickets to those who otherwise cannot attend home games is an important step towards making people feel included in our local community.“We work closely with the club and its sponsors to identify individuals and organisations who can benefit from becoming part of the Aberdeen FC family.’Barry Douglas, Seaton Community Church pastor, is delighted to see a scheme supporting those most in need in the local community.Douglas said: “The people this scheme is helping out are from under-privileged backgrounds and who would not normally have access to football.“You really get to see the joy being brought out in them when they receive their tickets.“The tickets I have distributed so far have gone to families who will get a huge uplift from them.“There are more out there who could benefit from this scheme, so I hope it’s a great success.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"actor signed up to host ball for childrens charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA popular Scottish television and theatre actor is set to host a charity ball in Aberdeen.Glasgow-born Alan McHugh, whose acting credits include Taggart and Limmy\u0026#8217s Show, as well as a starring role at HMT’s annual panto, will compere the evening at The Chester Hotel on August 25 to support The ARCHIE Foundation.It is the second annual ball held by the charity to raise money for its work at the Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital.The ARCHIE Foundation provides specialist medical equipment, advanced staff training, child-friendly hospital spaces and emergency grants.Alan said: “I’m delighted and honoured to be able to help such a worthwhile charity as ARCHIE through the Storybook Ball.“Over the last 15 years of doing the panto at HMT, the cast make an annual visit to the children’s hospital, so I’ve been lucky enough to witness first-hand the fantastic work they do with not just the children, but their families too.”This year’s ball has an ‘enchanted forest’ theme.Chief executive of The ARCHIE Foundation David Wood said: “We are incredibly grateful to Alan who is giving up his time to support our Children’s Hospital Storybook Ball.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"biggest ever festival to take to the city streets","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA fiddle festival will put musicians on Aberdeen\u0026#8217s streets in an entertaining “busking trail”.The North Atlantic Fiddle Convention (NAFCo) will be held between Wednesday and July 15, bringing artists from across the world to the Granite City.

Even once the school closes, the feelings that I have will continue for the rest of my days.”And former pupil Rhonda Scott was in the crowd.The 54-year-old alumni said: “I started Torry in 1976 and the first thing I remember about Torry is the music and the happiness.“It’s more than a school – it’s a family.“The staff and the way they are with the children and the support that they get.“I’m a teacher and I’ve taught at lots of schools and I also taught here.“This is the best school I have ever taught at – never mind being a pupil.“There’s nothing like that and you don’t understand until you come here.”The school commissioned a commemorative tree sculpture to recognise its role in the Torry community over the last 10 decades.The site will also retain its educational purpose with the construction of a new primary school which will include early learning and childcare facilities and a community hub.John Wheeler, education operational delivery convener, said: “I am delighted to see so many people turn up and it speaks volumes of the impact the school has had on the local community.“I hope that sense of community has a positive future in the new Lochside Academy and carries over.”Kincorth Academy, which closed on Wednesday, marked its closure with an open day for former pupils and staff.Pupils and staff from Torry and Kincorth will start at the new £47 million Lochside Academy on August 23.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dean meets up with old friend prince harry and has a ball","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA record-breaking cyclist from the city has spoken of his pride after his pal Prince Harry attended a ball held in his honour.Former special forces soldier Dean Stott grabbed headlines around the world in May when he became the fastest man to cycle the length of the Americas – the equivalent of cycling from Aberdeen to Bangkok and back in just 99 days.Dean, 41, of Peterculter, was the guest of honour at the glitzy Wheels Down Ball at St James’s Place.Before the black-tie dinner, world record breaker Dean had raised more than £500,000 for eight mental health charities – and the success of the ball has taken the total past the £700,000 mark.The showpiece of the ball was a round table chat hosted by TV presenter Martin Bayfield, in which Dean and the Duke of Sussex – pals from when they were in the Armed Forces – chatted about their friendship and Dean’s achievement.\u0026mdash Alison Baum OBE (@AlisonBaum) July 4, 2018Dean said: “It was a very proud moment for me, to have the support of so many people.“I’ve known Harry for 11 years and we speak often – the last time I’d seen him was his wedding and he had other things to be preoccupied with on that day.”Father-of-two Dean said the Duke of Sussex had commented on the amount of weight he had lost during the 13,670-mile cycle ride along the Pan American Highway from Argentina to Alaska.He added: “It was a fun night and all the better because the setting was so intimate. It was also a pleasure to have Martin there.“It’s important that we keep the conversations about mental health going, and I am pleased with how the evening went.”Among the guests were representatives of NXg Drilling Services and asset management firm Infinity Partners, both of which are based in Aberdeen.Dean, who met Prince Harry when they were partnered during military training, had to leave the military when a parachuting injury left him unable to run.Afterwards, Dean took up cycling and it was a chat with Harry that inspired him to take on the Pan American Highway challenge.The quest began in February at the southern tip of South America, in Ushuaia, Argentina, and took in 13 countries. Along the way, Dean battled harsh winds, multiple collisions, bouts of food poisoning and even a run-in with a polar bear.Dean’s wife, Alana, said: “It was a fitting night at the Wheels Down Ball in many ways because the challenge was two years in the making and we’ve been in it as a family.“Our youngest child, Tommy, is now two and when we began planning the challenge he was still in my belly, and he got the chance to go up on the stage on the night.“We are both pleased that people are feeling more comfortable having conversations about mental health and the superb work the eight charities do in supporting that is to be commended.”The eight charities, which come under the Heads Together umbrella, are: Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, Best Beginnings, Calm, Contact, Mind, Place2Be, the Mix and Young Minds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jenny creates moving piece of artistic work","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen pupil\u0026#8217s artistic skills are set to be admired by hundreds of bus passengers after she scooped top prize in a competition.The entry by Jenny Lee, 11, was chosen from 200 other pupils at Kingswells Primary, who were tasked with creating a piece of art that showed the benefits of public transport.The contest was run by bus firm Stagecoach and the winning entry will be on display for passengers to see on the number 14 service between Aberdeen and Kingswells.Head teacher Moira McIver said: “All of the children did a fantastic job creating their entries for the competition and I look forward to seeing Jenny’s winning design on the buses.”Ian Bell, operations manager for Stagecoach North Scotland, added: “It was hard to narrow it down to just one winner.

Instead, she was taken by medical taxi last Saturday to Stavanger Airport and boarded a private medical aircraft – staffed by a doctor and nurse.She was then taken from Aberdeen International Airport to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary before being allowed to return to her Sheddocksley home on Tuesday after undergoing surgery to correct a problem in a device that regulates her heartbeat.Mrs Kirkton said: “I’m chuffed to be home and that the doctors have done such a good job in Aberdeen.“It was quite an adventure to have my own private plane to get home – that’s another thing ticked off the bucket list.”She added: “I’m grateful to the Evening Express for getting involved and helping to sort it all out. The cruise was great – and then I fell ill. Being winched up into the helicopter was a strange experience.“The staff at the hospital in Norway were great.”Mrs Kirkton is fitted with a pacemaker, which now regulates her heartbeat.

But Sam, who was then 17 years old, broke his neck in the accident, and now lives with paralysis affecting all his limbs.Sam, 26, didn’t let the accident stop him, and gained a place to study philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University – graduating in 2014. Now he and his brother Andrew, 24, have joined their mum by doing their own challenges.Sarah said she was looking to raise as much as possible for the three charities.The challenge includes a swim, cycle and run, like a triathlon but is designed to be accessible to as many people as possible regardless of their ability.She said: “I will spend eight weeks trying to make a difference with this challenge.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen.

The A team finished only half a second ahead of the B team in the 4 x 100 metres relay. The B team consisted of Maisie Gilmour and Jodie Allan from Ardrishaig, Sophie Balkeen from Lochgair and Erin Naisby from Furnace.The girls contest was won by Law and District.This national competition was a great experience, not just for the young athletes competing in the big arena, but also for the supportive parents who provided transport on the day.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dust flies in cracking argyll rally","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/07/18, 12:07 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The Dunoon Presents Rally on June 23 saw the Scottish Rally Championship roll into town and 58 top-spec cars and crews take to the stages.Dust flew in dry conditions up in the hills of Cowal as drivers tested their skills among forestry roads in what turned out to be an excellent rally.The route this year was slightly different, with two new stages added to a schedule which saw the cars cover each of the four stages twice through the day with two service stops at Dunoon Stadium along the way.There were a few well known Argyll faces out there, with mixed fortunes on the day.Douglas Watt from Furnace managed to rebuild his Escort after its small excursion on the Scottish Rally in May and he was out again, hoping for better luck and a finish for he and his co-driver, Mark Grierson. The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now? It’s a ghost town. “There is not a lot about, but the beach is an attraction that brings in people from all over the country. “Walking along the beach seeing this mess was nothing short of disgusting. “It gets to me as it’s such a beautiful beach. “What you also have to think about is that all kinds of rubbish is going to be washed out to sea when the tide comes in.  “It’s just going to get even worse going forward as the schools are now off. “More people will be going to the beach and it’s just going to become an absolute travesty. “People have no respect for the beach, but the council should have someone cleaning up when it’s like that.” A council spokesman said: “We monitor our beaches closely and work within the national guidance and with available resources to keep our beaches looking their best, so they can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike. “We clean and litter-pick the full stretch of Ayr Beach and ask people to dispose of their waste in our bins rather than abandoning rubbish on the sand. “The section from Cromwell Road to the Pier is not routinely mechanically cleaned as it’s classed as an amenity beach rather than a recreational beach, but the stretch is still managed on a regular basis.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lane closure inspection station hotel","story":"NewsLane closure as inspection at Station HotelGable end of the building to be investigated\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning17:58, 6 JUL 2018Updated18:03, 6 JUL 2018NewsFront entrance to Ayr railway station is blocked off (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne lane of the A70 will be shut off to allow for an inspecton of the gable wall of the Station Hotel just off Burns Statute Square. In order to carry out the inspection, one lane of the A70 which runs over the railway bridge towards Holmston Road and Station Road will be closed temporarily from tomorrow (7th July 2018). The section of the pavement which runs adjacent to the road will also be closed on a temporary basis. The inspection to assess the gable end will form part of the overall structural survey which the Council is undertaking to obtain a detailed report on the condition of the building. Trains are expected to run as normal, however the temporary pavement closure may affect passengers making their way to and from platform 4. Since the closure of the main entrance, some passengers have been using the pavement next to the A70 as an alternative route. Network Rail and Scotrail have been informed of the partial road closure and we are working with them to ensure passengers can get to and from the various platforms as easily and as safely as possible. Donald Gillies, Director – Place at South Ayrshire Council said: “We’re linking with our partners to limit disruption to the public however these inspections and subsequent works are necessary at this time. As we get a clearer picture of the condition of the building further restrictions may be necessary to keep rail users and the wider public safe. “We will continue to track the work carried out on the privately owned building with a view to recovering the costs of these works from the owners.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilTransport"},{"url":null,"title":"win-300-in-our-pet-idol-2018-competition","story":"Calling all animal lovers...\nEntries are now open for this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition \u0026ndash and your chance to win \u0026pound300!\nAll you have to do is send us a photo of your pet - feathered, furry or finned.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep.

Identity cards can be faked \u0026ndash phone the company to verify their identity.\n\u0026bull Some companies offer a password system. Ask your utility providers if this can be used and if you have a password with a company make sure the caller uses it.\n\u0026bull Never let people try to persuade you to let them into your home even if they are asking for help \u0026ndash they may not be genuine. If someone is persistent, ask them to call at another time and arrange for a friend or family member to be with you.\n\u0026bull Never agree to pay for goods or give money to strangers who arrive at your door.\n\u0026bull Don\u0026rsquot keep large amounts of money in your home.\n\u0026bull Remember, it\u0026rsquos your home.

including the need for pavements and footpaths at some of the newly built housing housing schemes on Islay, speeding through our villages, dog fouling, and bus links to Keills Primary School.The following day I joined my fellow Conservative and Unionist councillors at the Environment Development and Infrastructure Committee.I spoke about the need to see our council become more business-friendly, welcoming and promoting competition, supporting economic growth and getting off the backs of the growing numbers of local entrepreneurs.I also pointed out the importance of promoting our growing film industry with blockbusters such as Jurassic World being filmed right here in Argyll.This industry offers huge opportunities for our local economy and should not be ignored.Later that day I travelled to Tarbert to visit and speak to local residents and businesses.It was great to see so many Islay and Jura whiskies in Tarbert\u0026#8217s Whisky West Coast

campaign","story":"The school summer holidays are here and it’s easy for health routines to go out of the window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit www.asthma.org.uk/safersummerDr Andy Whittamore, Practicing GP, Clinical Lead at Asthma UK.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"2012s

The Aqualibrium is not where most people want to cross.\u0026#8216People going to and from the Co-op and Tesco want to cross at the junction between them.\u0026#8216Likewise, people going to the harbour from the town centre want to cross at the Royal Hotel.\u0026#8216As it is, as a driver I was unaware the town had any crossings, apart from the pelican crossing in the Main Street. None are marked for drivers.\u0026#8216Is there any point in having them if drivers do not know they are there?\u0026#8216If they are indeed crossings, mark them. All road users need to know what they are in the interest of safety.\u0026#8217Mark Sutherland: \u0026#8216I have on several occasions crossed the road near the Co-op, and due to the speed of some inconsiderate drivers have had narrow misses. As for reporting to the police, this is ridiculous as the police would not really be interested as they have enough to do.\u0026#8216It is obvious if you stand there long enough that several people try to cross and give up or take a chance.\u0026#8216A crossing is required, especially for the elderly and infirm, as they can not make it across as quickly.\u0026#8216Common sense needs to be implemented by the right authorities to ensure that pedestrians can cross safely.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrian crossings","story":"There are also no traditional pedestrian pelican crossings.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7972409.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cement-plant-says-sorry-for-cars-being-coated-in-dust","story":"  Numerous complaints were made on social media regarding cars and, in particular, car windscreens being covered in dust late last month.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Provost John McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe were hugely impressed with the quality and range of entries that we received, which ranged from drawings to poems, comic strips to letters.  \"It was clear that everyone had really taken the challenge to heart, and had put a lot of thought and care into their entries.  \u0026ldquoThe judging panel really enjoyed the judging process, even though the task of choosing our winners was a difficult one.  \"I want to thank each and every entrant for taking part and sharing with us your ideas \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos clear that we can all play our part in improving life in East Lothian.  Ilma\u0027s mum Rukhsana told the Courier at the prizegiving: \"I am overwhelmed \u0026ndash I can\u0027t quite believe it.  \"As they went through the winners I didn\u0027t think she was going to get anything but it\u0027s just brilliant.\"  And Cllr McMillan praised the eight-year-old Windygoul Primary School pupil\u0027s entry.  He said: \"Ilma\u0026rsquos entry, which included simple messages such as \u0026lsquoBe kind to each other\u0026rsquo, and \u0026lsquopick up litter because we need to save the environment\u0026rsquo really summed up what we can all do to make East Lothian \u0026ndash and life - better for everyone, not just for young people.\"  Louise, meanwhile, was joined at the prizegiving by her grandmother Sheena Watt, who said: \"I am just so proud of her.\"  And of her entry, Haddington and Lammermuir ward member Cllr McMillan said: \"Louise\u0026rsquos entry, which focused on education and teaching young people, used a really creative approach and asked us to think \u0026lsquooutside the box\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash that we need to remember that everyone is unique and that we can all learn from each other.  Ilma and Louise were presented with a certificate and prizes from East Lothian attractions Foxlake Adventures, Scottish Seabird Centre, EnjoyLeisure and Musselburgh Racecourse.

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.

The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.

Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.

Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024055.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"couple-get-permission-to-turn-old-bar-back-into-pub","story":"  Michael and Wendy Peters took over the Gardeners Arms in Haddington in 2011 when its licence had come under review because of problems experienced by previous management.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.

After the historic US-North Korea summit in Singapore, President Donald Trump declared the North was no longer a threat and would hand over the remains of American soldiers.  Yet three weeks later, the two sides were still divided on all the issues, including exactly what denuclearisation means and how it might be verified.

After almost 12 hours of thrashing out the pros and cons of her proposed customs plan during a Cabinet away-day in her country retreat at Chequers, Mrs May issued a dramatic statement.  She said: \u0026ldquoToday in detailed discussions, the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU.  \u0026ldquoOur proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area, which establishes a common rule-book for industrial goods and agricultural products. This maintains high standards in these areas but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.  \u0026ldquoAs a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.  She went on: \u0026ldquoWe have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world.  \u0026ldquoNext week we will be publishing a White Paper, which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.  \u0026ldquoNow we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve, added Mrs May, who is expected to make a Commons statement on Monday to set out in detail to MPs her proposed way forward on Brexit.  Despite talk of possible resignations by the likes of Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, and David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, none had materialised.  Earlier, Nicola Sturgeon suggested how the best outcome of the Chequers summit would have been the resignation of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquohard Brexiteers as this might have signalled a \u0026ldquoglimmer of hope that common sense starts to prevail.  The First Minister warned the worst outcome would be if Mrs May\u0026rsquos colleagues emerged \u0026ldquoarm in arm, saying they\u0027ve agreed, because that means there\u0027s another helping of fudge being served up.  She added if the outcome of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos marathon session was simply an agreement that satisfied the apparently irreconcilable wings of the Tory government, then the \u0026ldquodanger is\u0026hellipthat it will be dead on arrival in Brussels and we will be no further forward in reaching agreement\" with the EU27.  Over a dinner of whiskey and treacle-cured Scottish salmon, Mrs May and her senior colleagues put the finishing touches to their Cabinet deal, which some colleagues and pundits believed impossible. Talk among Brexiteers beforehand had claimed that the PM\u0026rsquos facilitated customs arrangement \u0026ndash a hybrid of the two previous options \u0026ndash was \u0026ldquonot full Brexit and that regulatory alignment with the EU on goods would prevent the UK from striking its own future trade deals.  However, perhaps in a key sign of the agreement to come, Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, broke off from a meeting of Brexiteers on Thursday night, organised by Mr Johnson at the Foreign Office, to have private talks with the PM, who sought to reassure him that under her compromise plan future trade deals would be possible. He emerged \u0026ldquocontent with her plan.  Key now will be how Brussels reacts. Earlier, Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, said that he was ready to adapt the EU27\u0027s stance in response to any changes to the UK\u0027s \"red lines\".  Meanwhile, it emerged at a meeting at London\u0026rsquos Carlton Club on Thursday night, David Cameron persuaded Mr Johnson not to resign, saying Mrs May\u0026rsquos third-way customs plan was the only one the Commons would accept.  While the PM was thrashing out her plan with colleagues at Chequers, her predecessor was watching thrashing of a sporting kind.  Mr Cameron was looking tanned and relaxed in a smart suit and sunglasses in the Royal Box at Wimbledon alongside his mother Mary and a previous Foreign Secretary, Lord Hague."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8035370.jpg?type=article-full","title":"bbcs-gracie-gives-tips-to-help-aspiring-journalists-at-future-news-conference","story":"  Carrie Gracie was among top media figures who took part in the Future News Worldwide event, which was held at the Scottish Parliament.

They teach at Scottish Space School, a summer programme run each year by the University of Strathclyde, which encourages S5 school students to consider a career in the space industry or engineering  For young Scots, space might not seem an obvious career avenue, but Scotland\u0026rsquos burgeoning space industry is now worth \u0026pound2.5 billion a year and growing. There is also a political drive to get more young people into Science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM). Scottish Space School is also not just about making young people think about space \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos about showing them the possibilities of a career in STEM.  As Marianne Ballantyne, who runs the school out of the Faculty of Engineering at University of Strathclyde, notes, \u0026ldquoWe use space as the hook to encourage applications into engineering and STEM, because there is nothing like that at all. The NASA people that come over here all have a stem background, so they\u0026rsquore all scientists or engineers or in the STEM areas.  The space school, however, doesn\u0026rsquot just bring NASA to Scotland \u0026ndash it takes ten of its star students out to Houston for an all access tour of NASA, a night hanging out at astronauts\u0026rsquo homes for a pool party and other space-related activities. This year 547 pupils across Scotland applied for the 100 places at space school. Ten of those were selected for the highly prized trip to Houston.  Among them was Evie Clark. The 16-year-old has long had an interest in space and had already considered doing engineering before she attended space school. However, she notes that when she was younger she didn\u0026rsquot see it as something for her. \u0026ldquoI had the mindset that, as a girl, I couldn\u0026rsquot do that because that\u0026rsquos about boys who become mechanics. I thought it was about cars and getting your hands dirty. But my uncle\u0026rsquos an engineer and I went for a day at my uncle\u0026rsquos work. One of the women said who here thinks engineering is just for boys? Loads of the girls put their hands up. She said, \u0026lsquoNo it\u0026rsquos not.\u0026rsquo  The ambition of working in the space industry may seem a far-fetched one for young people living in Scotland, but Scottish Space School makes it seem realisable. As Clark puts it, \u0026ldquoI always thought working with space would be a dream, but not one that would ever realistically happen. I thought that\u0026rsquos not going to happen. People from Scotland don\u0026rsquot work in the space industry. But just going and seeing so many people doing jobs that you would dream about and talking to them was such a motivator that it\u0026rsquos spurred me on to think this is what I\u0026rsquom going to do. I will make it happen.  Space school also isn\u0026rsquot just about the Houston trip \u0026ndash which takes place in October this year. The week in itself is a challenging and rewarding experience for the young people. They get to build a rocket and launch it in Bellahouston park, design a product to enhance life in space, and be inspired by the NASA team. Also, on this year\u0026rsquos programme was Lewis Jones, a 17-year-old from Trinity High School in Rutherglen, who recalls that one of the most thrilling moments for him was when he got to press the button and launch the rocket.  Jones had always been interested in planes, right from when he was a small child, and on family holidays he would sit at the airport watching them take off and land, marvelling at how they stayed up in the air. \u0026ldquoMy family are proud that I\u0026rsquom going to Houston, he says. \u0026ldquoWhen I told them, they were jumping up and down. They couldn\u0026rsquot believe it because, assuming I go, I would be the first person in my family to go to university. My dad works in construction, my mum in a chip shop. The main people that inspired me were the teachers.  NASA space surgeon Rick Scheuring views his role, in space school, as partly about helping young people who might never think they have a chance in the space industry to consider it. \u0026ldquoI remember, he recalls. \u0026ldquoI was at a NASA event ten years ago and a young inner city kid in Houston, came up to the podium and told the panel that for a kid who doesn\u0026rsquot come from a great socioeconomic background and didn\u0026rsquot do well at school, NASA is unapproachable. Spaceflight is not something that a kid like him could even dream of being part of. But the thing I tell kids is, \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom that kid. I didn\u0026rsquot have great grades when I was growing up. My parents didn\u0026rsquot have a lot of money. I went to average state schools. But tenacity and perseverance really paid off.\u0026rsquo  Both Scheuring and Williams also provide stories of how it\u0026rsquos possible to get to that dream job via a indirect route. Scheuring worked as a \u0026ldquosmalltown private practice doctor in Illinois for many years, but always with it in his mind that he might like to combine medicine with his love of space. Williams originally wanted to be a veterinarian, but didn\u0026rsquot get into the university she hoped to, ended up I the navy, worked as a test pilot, and found a possible path from there to space. She would go on to hold the record, which has since been broken, for most space walks done by a woman.  Scheuring observes that he is often struck by the enthusiasm for space when he works with children in countries which, like Scotland, don\u0026rsquot have a space programme. \u0026ldquoI talk to-12-year old kids in Taiwan who are crazy about space, and I wonder what it is that is inspiring them. Then. I think back to my own story and think, \u0026lsquoYeah, we had a space programme in the 1960s and 1970s but it was just the wonder of space and being a part of something much bigger than yourself.\u0026rsquo Kids hook onto that stuff, and they want that.  Many of the Scottish Space School alumni have gone on to study engineering. One is already working in the Scottish space industry at Clyde Space. Marnie McKay, a student currently doing an MA in electrical mechanical engineering at the University of Strathclyde, recalls how Scottish Space School made her rethink her career plans. She had been \u0026ldquobent on becoming a lawyer, but then, she says, the programme \u0026ldquocompletely turned my head.  A reason, she believes, she hadn\u0026rsquot thought about engineering in the first place is the stereotypes that exist around it. \u0026ldquoI had completely the wrong idea of what engineering is. My parents discouraged me too, because they think of boys that play with Lego and computers in their free time are more suited, and I did theatre and singing and dancing.  Her special interest is power engineering, and she is currently looking at working in the renewables industry. Space, though, is still on her mind. \u0026ldquoI went into power engineering because it\u0026rsquos still space related. Although I ended up working in the power sector I wouldn\u0026rsquot rule out working in the space industry in the future.  On her visit to Houston, she recalls, that one of the things that struck her most was how down to earth and accessible the people she met at NASA were. \u0026ldquoI realised that they were people like me and that if I applied my passion as well I could probably make the same sort of difference. That\u0026rsquos what inspired me - that they were normal people not superhuman.  A path to space \u0026ndash Sunita Williams  Sunita Williams  \u0026ldquoThis was not my plan, to be an astronaut. I tell the students at Scottish Space School, that when you\u0026rsquore young you don\u0026rsquot have to have a plan. You can just have an idea of things that you\u0026rsquore interested in, and don\u0026rsquot be totally disappointed if things change along the way. I was very fortunate to have, when I was a kid, what I would call potential failures. I didn\u0026rsquot get the first thing that I wanted to get. I didn\u0026rsquot get into the university that I thought I needed to go to in order to become a veterinarian. But it opened another door and I got into the navy and this gave me the opportunity to learn how to fly and that gave me an opportunity to become a test pilot, which was what got me on my way to thinking about applying to be an astronaut.  One of the things that left the biggest impression on me was my first spacewalk. You\u0026rsquore just going outside the space station for the first time and you\u0026rsquore trying not to be nervous but you\u0026rsquore a little nervous. Then, when I finally got out of the door and put a tether on, all of a sudden, the sun came up. It was mind blowing. A little later, we flew over Canada and the northern lights were below us. It was amazing to be above them. I\u0026rsquod seen them from below but never from above. Being up there really puts things in perspective. Our planet is awesome. We think everything that is going on here is so important and then you realise there is so much energy in the universe and things going on we have no control of.  In NASA, of course there are more men than women. I was in the military and that was a little bit more, in my mind, male oriented than NASA was. The stem fields were not very populated on the American side then women. But it\u0026rsquos improving more and more. But the class of 2013 was four men and four women. They were the most qualified. That\u0026rsquos happening.  What I do with Scottish Space School is really about encouraging the next generation to explore. There is so much we have to learn about. What we do in space is also about helping people solve problems on earth. It makes people think outside of the box. You design something to use in space and you have to think about things differently. And not only are you using those creative juices to design something that works in space you\u0026rsquore also using them to find ways to do things here."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-says-game-on-after-tory-cabinet-agrees-soft-brexit-plan","story":"  After a day of intensive discussions at the Prime Minister\u0027s country seat, Chequers, on Friday Theresa May managed to secure the agreement of her top ministerial team to proposals setting out the country\u0027s future relationship with the European Union.  The plans, which still have to be assessed by the 27 other nations of the EU, would result in the creation of a UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a \"common rulebook\".  \"It\u0027s a Trojan Horse deal,\" is how rising SNP star Christopher McEleny described it, predicting that the EU would reject the proposal. \"This is fantasy politics,\" added McEleny, who is also the leader of the party group on Inverclyde Council. \"Every single one of the 27 EU members has to agree it and the plain truth is that they won\u0027t.\"  His comments seemed to be at odds with Sturgeon\u0027s, who described the plan as having \"more realism in it than we\u0027ve seen before from UK government\", although she added \"that\u0027s not saying much\".  Hardline eurosceptic MPs have begun to voice concerns over May\u0026rsquos plans to negotiate a soft Brexit deal. Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has already warned he will have to wait to see \"have the red lines been turned pink\", as he claimed the proposals could be worse than a no-deal Brexit.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4 he said: \"As with eggs. An egg that is very softly boiled isn\u0027t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven\u0027t left, we are simply a rule-taker. That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.\" A comment underlined by fellow Tory Andrea Jenkyns MP.  The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage described it as a sell out. \u0026ldquoTheresa May has betrayed us all \u0026ndash and Brexiteer ministers are letting her get away with it, he said.  However, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the newly outlined Brexit plan would deliver for Scotland in three key areas, \"providing Scottish business with frictionless access to the EU market, withdrawing the Scottish fishing industry from the hated Common Fisheries Policy and, by ensuring no border in the Irish Sea, bolstering Scotland\u0027s biggest and most important market, the UK internal market.\"  She also hit out at the SNP, claiming Scottish nationalists had \"used the Brexit referendum as a pretext for pulling our country apart\".  Downing Street is now engaged in desperate efforts to win over Tory Eurosceptics after May\u0027s Brexit compromise plan which keeping the UK closely tied to Brussels was agreed by her Cabinet.  The Prime Minister\u0027s inner circle is now desperately trying to secure support from the party\u0027s eurosceptics for the proposals to create a new UK-EU free trade area for goods.  Cabinet Brexiteers may have already been persuaded to support the plans after a marathon session of talks at Chequers, but backbench eurosceptics continue to express grave doubts.  The common rulebook for goods, including food and agricultural products, could limit the UK\u0027s ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize. The cabinet Brexiter Chris Grayling acknowledged the proposal could lead to issues in negotiating a US trade deal.

Aberdour Silver Sands in Fife is shallow for a long stretch, making it a good introduction to outdoor swimming for all ages and abilities. Another plus is the proximity to the village itself, where besides places to refuel there\u0026rsquos Aberdour Castle, one of the oldest stone castles in Scotland, and the medieval St Fillan\u0026rsquos Church. Both are well worth a visit.  Loch Ken in Dumfries and Galloway is regularly fed by water from the nearby hydro-electric scheme so it is cleaner than most. Like Aberdour, it is suitable for all the family and Galloway Activity Centre could be a base for convenience and access to a waterfront cafe.  And for those with a competitive urge, there are races coming up on September 8 \u0026ndash 1km, 2km, 4km and a children\u0026rsquos splash session \u0026ndash in aid of Barnardo\u0026rsquos.  A few lengths from the central belt, Milarrochy Bay just north of Balmaha on Loch Lomond is suitable for swimmers out for a paddle or those in training for something more strenuous, and there are food and drink options in both Balmaha and nearby Drymen.  A little further afield, Calgary Bay in Mull is sheltered with everything you could ask for: soft sand, crystal-clear water and, if you\u0026rsquore lucky, the sight of an eagle. Loch Ard, near Aberfoyle, offers a wealth of watersports \u0026hellip swimming being just one of them.  Safety, particularly in Scotland where deep water temperatures can sit stubbornly close to freezing at any time of year, is key. Police Scotland has issued a warning following a number of incidents in the heatwave.  Superintendent Carol McGuire, who leads on specialist operations which includes the Dive and Marine Unit, warns: \u0026ldquoOpen water can be extremely cold and can cause your body to cramp, some people even go into shock. Very cold water can also have an impact on your ability to swim. We would urge people to take note of the signage in areas which clearly states that you should not enter the water. These signs are there for your safety, so please, don\u0026rsquot think that you know better.\u0026ldquo On beaches, it is advisable to keep an eye out for tides and currents. Be prepared for underwater obstacles and alcohol should be a no-no. A brightly-coloured cap will help others see you if the water is busy or you get into bother. Wear a wetsuit \u0026ndash it will allow you a few extra minutes in the water before a quick change for a hot cup of tea.

The England boss Gareth Southgate has praised him to the heavens.  Russell also had a subsidiary career as a male model and also appeared in an episode of River City.  The England scorers were defender Harry Maguire and midfielder Dele Alli who struck on either side of half-time, both with headers. A stubborn Swedish challenge was again thwarted with a magnificent display from goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.  The team will now play Croatia, who beat home team Russia in the other quarter-final on penalties after the match finished 2-2. The Russian equaliser came from Brazilian-born Fernandes. Although he had made one appearance for Brazil in 2014 he was granted Russian citizenship through a presidential decree from Vladimi Putin which qualified him to play.

The bottle had previously been sold for \u0026pound4,200 in 2014, an annual increase in value of 280 per cent.  Earlier this year a special-edition bottle of The Macallan, with a label designed by pop artist Peter Blake, was sold for \u0026pound1.1m at an auction in Hong Kong.  Sean McGlone, Whisky Auctioneer director, said a growing number of people from across the world, especially from the Far East, were starting to collect whisky as an investment. He claimed that while new producers from countries such as Japan were increasingly able to attract big mark-ups, it was still the Scotch and Scottish whiskies that are fetching the record-breaking prices.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos been a huge increase in the number of people drinking and enjoying whisky and also in investing in whisky, not just in the UK and Europe but all around the world. It\u0026rsquos a booming international business.  \u0026ldquoScottish whiskies are now reaching their highest prices ever. They are doing fantastically well and breaking all sorts of records left, right and centre. It\u0026rsquos not looking like slowing down either. The Scottish whisky industry is on the up and up. That\u0026rsquos not to detract from the other producers of whisky, such as Japan, whose whiskies are also doing well as auction. But I\u0026rsquod say they are the only other country who could hold a candle to Scotland.  But he claimed that Brexit would be \u0026ldquoa nightmare for the business, especially if no trade deal can be reached, with export duties and regulations making it almost impossible to trade in the UK, and potentially meaning relocation to Europe.  \u0026ldquoWe trade in a global market with many collectors in the States or the Far East, he added. \u0026ldquoAnything that stops free trade is therefore really bad for the collectable whisky market.  Blair Bowman, whisky consultant and author, who has also turned broker in the last six months, agreed there was now a demand for whisky that was even driving up prices of standard, good quality bottles as producers realised that there was money to be made.  He is now selling single casks to a select client base from around the world including those in the Far East and the States. But he said it was essential that people understood the whisky market if they wanted to really make money.  \u0026ldquoThe brands that always do well are things like Ardbeg, The Macallan and Bowmore, but unless it\u0026rsquos a very rare edition you have to be prepared to keep those for a very long time if they are going to be worth anything, he added.  He said it was important that people didn\u0026rsquot forget about the special nature of the drink \u0026ndash made from a trinity of grain, water and time \u0026ndash in their haste to make money. With two previously crashes in the whisky market, one at the turn of the 20th century due to the temperance movement and one in the eighties due to over-production, experts have warned potential investors should buy bottles they would be happy to drink as well as sell.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos great that more people are taking an interest, and it\u0026rsquos great for the status of whisky, added Bowman. \u0026ldquoBut I think it\u0026rsquos sad if you end up with a market of investors who never open a bottle. I know of one Chinese investor who doesn\u0026rsquot drink alcohol for example. Whisky is meant to be shared \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos about shared moments and experiences.  Andy Simpson, co-founder of whisky investment company Rare Whisky 101, said: \u0026ldquoWith more buyers than ever in the market for the best whiskies, the value of highly-regarded single malts is increasing at a rapid rate, with prices being dictated by this consumer demand. Investors, collectors and connoisseurs are becoming increasingly aware of whisky\u0026rsquos rapidly growing popularity around the world, particularly for the rarest and most coveted single malts."},{"url":null,"title":"fiona-hyslop-our-links-with-japan-and-south-korea-have-gone-from-strength-to-strength","story":"  As Brexit uncertainty continues to impact on business confidence \u0026ndash and as we face the threat of losing membership of the Single Market and Custom Union \u0026ndash it is increasingly important that we continue to engage with international partners and build trade and business links.  As highlighted by a recent EY Attractiveness Survey, Scotland is one of the most alluring locations for foreign direct investment outside of London. Scottish Government visits such as this are therefore critical to promote our unique assets to international audiences.  This is why during this visit I met with key business representatives across a range of sectors including renewables, subsea engineering and life sciences \u0026ndash from Mitsubishi Electric to the Nippon Foundation \u0026ndash to acknowledge the significant contribution these businesses make to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy and to reiterate the message that Scotland is an excellent partner to do business with.  The ties between Scotland and Japan date back 150 years to a time when Scots engineers helped the Pacific nation kick-start its own industrial revolution. The links between our countries have since gone from strength to strength \u0026ndash so that, to date, 90 Japanese-owned businesses at 135 Scottish sites employ over 6,000 staff, generating a Scottish turnover of more than \u0026pound1.8 billion.  In 2016, exports to Japan increased by more than 10 per cent to \u0026pound460m, making Japan the 19th top destination for Scottish exports. With foreign direct investment into Scotland from Japan accounting for almost six per cent of all inward investment over the past decade, I believe there is scope for even closer collaboration \u0026ndash to seize shared opportunities and meet common challenges as both our countries look to address the growing needs of the global market.  Following the launch of our Scotland is Now campaign, this visit was an opportunity to further promote Scotland as a top destination to visit, live, work, invest and study. I held tourism events in both Tokyo and Seoul. I also signed a joint declaration of co-operation between Scotland and Yokohama, the second largest city in Japan and host to two of Scotland\u0026rsquos Rugby World Cup games in 2019.  Building on the constructive meeting I held with Yokohama\u0027s mayor during my last visit, this declaration is an excellent opportunity to exchange knowledge and expertise, while strengthening existing ties in the areas of education, sports, culture and marine industries as Japan builds to the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the Olympics and Paralympics in 2020.  In addition, I met with local representatives and culture stakeholders to share best practices and discuss how culture in Scotland plays a vital role in shaping our cultural identity, strengthening business links and promoting our country internationally.  While in Tokyo I met with representatives from Japan\u0026rsquos Ricca Ricca Festival, the annual international festival of performing arts for young people held in Okinawa. This year, the festival will focus on Scotland as a result of a joint funding initiative between Ricca Ricca, Creative Scotland, Scottish Government and British Council Scotland. As we celebrate Scotland\u0026rsquos Year of Young People 2018, this represents a great opportunity for Scotland\u0026rsquos world leading children\u0026rsquos theatre to showcase their talent to international audiences beyond our borders.  I also met with Japanese city leaders in Tokyo to discuss how Scotland\u0026rsquos arts community can help Japan shape its cultural programme for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Japanese prefectures are now looking to deliver a world-class programme of cultural activity as part of the Olympics and are looking to Scotland for inspiration. It was a pleasure to discuss Scotland\u0026rsquos use of culture as a promotional tool in domestic and international markets while we get ready to welcome our Japanese partners to Scotland this August during Edinburgh\u0026rsquos peak festival season.  I was delighted to witness the signing of an important agreement between Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd, a major Japanese industrial corporation, and the Underwater Centre near Fort William. It will see the world\u0026rsquos first test of an autonomous underwater vehicle take place in Scotland. Kawasaki will carry out a verification test of a prototype AUV equipped with a robot arm for subsea pipeline inspection.  This visit also represented an opportunity to promote our world-leading universities and to announce that the Scottish Government flagship Saltire Scholarship programme will open to Japanese postgraduates. Currently available to students from Canada, China, Pakistan and the US, the fund offers 50 scholarships worth \u0026pound8,000 per year, co-funded by the Scottish Government and partner universities.  In South Korea, I met with key tourism leaders and travel media, an ideal opportunity to further promote business and travel contacts between our two countries. I also met companies that are keen to build on their trade and investment in Scotland.  In 2017, Scotland exported 744 million of goods to South Korea, a 165 per cent increase on the previous year. Korean company Doosan Babcock is a key investor in Scotland, employing approximately 1,200 people across eight different sites,with the main facility in Renfrew.  At government level, I focussed on developing links on rural development and cultural issues.  Scotland has strengths and qualities that make it a unique location for international cooperation and investment. My message to our friends in Japan and the Republic of Korea is that, whatever your reason for coming to Scotland, you will be offered the warmest of welcomes here and will find a bold and positive country shaping a progressive, pioneering and inclusive future."},{"url":null,"title":"sprinklers-not-installed-at-burrell-museum-as-66m-upgrade-continues","story":"  The contractors hired to renovate the Burrell are Kier Construction, the same company which was undertaking work on the ill-fated Glasgow School of Art, which was destroyed by fire last month.  When Kier was awarded the contract managing director of the company in Scotland, Brian McQuade, said, \"We have a solid record of working on major heritage projects of this scale, including the restoration of the Mackintosh Building at the Galsgow School of Art and the refurbishment of Edinburgh College of Art and Aberdeen Music Hall.\"  It emerged after the fire which ravaged the Mackintosh building that while sprinklers had been installed they were not operational.  The Burrell, which displayed a portion of the artworks collected in the 19th century by Glasgow shipping magnate Sir William Burrell, is due to reopen in 2020. It is understood that the majority of the 9,000 artworks have been removed from the building in Pollok Park as it is cleared for Kier to begin work later this month.  A Kier spokesperson referred all questions to the client, Glasgow Life, a charity set up by the city council to deliver cultural, sporting and educational activities. Glasgow City Council has pledged \u0026pound27m towards the upgrade and virtually all of the budget has been raised.  A spokesman for Glasgow Life, confirming that no sprinklers are presently installed, said: \u0026ldquoThere is currently full-time security at the building.

I am, of course, referring to the morning after fire tore through .  For those of us who had been following events the night before on our social media feeds, we had seen videos and pictures of the huge blaze that destroyed Mackintosh\u0026rsquos historic Glasgow School of Art. Screeds of messages appeared on our screens in a collective outpouring of grief.  But it wasn\u0026rsquot until the morning after, when walking to work, I realised the impact on the city. The atmosphere at 8am on Sauchiehall Street was heavy with grief a sombre stillness, akin, in gravity, to the weighted hush after the Brexit vote.  Police officers quietly ushered early-morning tourists away from taped-off streets. Small crowds began to congregate on street corners. Some took photos of the derelict scenes before them and others merely stood in respectful remorse, heads shaking in numb disbelief.  High above the rooftops, a plume of black smoke trailed into the air like a funeral pyre.  It is easy, at first glance, to appreciate the devastating loss the blaze that ravaged through the art school incurred the brutal removal of an important Glasgow institution and the irreversible damage to years\u0026rsquo worth of renovation efforts since fire first struck in 2014. However, it was the reactions of those around me of dumbstruck passers-by and the eulogies of bereft alumni alike, that stuck me most.  I began to wonder, what was it about these iconic buildings, that made us care so deeply about them?  In addition to its capacity as a Glasgow landmark and university facility, the school of art was more than just a building.  It served, for many, as the background to the foremost years of their adult lives a place where individuality and expression was encouraged, and unique characters formed. Art school alumnus of architecture, Matt McCallum, who graduated on the day of the fire, shared his sadness of the loss of his university building, saying: \u0026ldquoThe importance of many of our historic buildings is based in more than just aesthetic. If the Mack is to be rebuilt anywhere but Garnethill, and as anything but a functioning art school, the magic is lost.  \u0026ldquoThe merit in this building is not only its craftwork or acute detailing but, in its ability, to inspire, provide, and nurture.  When we consider the history of the Glasgow School of Art, many know the bare bones of the profile of its creator, Charles Rennie Mackintosh \u0026ndash the talented Glasgow-born Art Nouveau architect and designer whose avant-garde work reshaped the design world of the early 1900s. Less is known about the artist\u0026rsquos personal life with his present-day fame eclipsing a turbulent past marred with an unstable career, coupled with countless rejections and reports of a suspected drinking problem.  Mackintosh\u0026rsquos work was largely unappreciated during his lifetime, and he died in poverty in 1928, unaware of the legacy he would leave behind. Speaking on Mackintosh\u0026rsquos influence, Glasgow writer and editor of Honest Error (2017), an anthology of poetry inspired by the artist\u0026rsquos work, Gillean McDougall reflects: \u0026ldquoI saw the broken Art School after the first fire in 2014 water flooding like tears down Scott Street, Glasgow people gathering in palpable, silent shock. \u0026ldquoThe 22 poets who subsequently contributed to my Honest Error anthology dug deep into the background of Mackintosh\u0026rsquos work, his and Margaret\u0026rsquos (his wife\u0026rsquos) experience, and a creative life which blossomed then withered to changing public taste.  \u0026ldquoTheir story \u0026ndash its poignancy, wit and ultimate genius \u0026ndash will continue to inspire generations, nothing can ever destroy that.  Heralded as his greatest masterpiece, the Mackintosh building epitomises the tireless efforts of an artist whose work was a labour of love in its most organic form, in spite of his many critics.  It represents the unique beauty and charm of the very best of Glasgow, a city whose tempestuous history could be said to reflect that of Mackintosh himself. We could spend hours lamenting the economic and cultural loss that the Mackintosh fire has brought to Glasgow but it\u0026rsquos behind the bricks and mortar where we see just why the building\u0026rsquos destruction has broken hearts of people across the world. A home and sanctuary to generations of artists through the years, the Glasgow School of Art will exist indefinitely in the memories of its students, staff and the Glasgow community, not only as a world-renowned school of art, but as a symbol for hope, individuality, and the legacy of one man\u0026rsquos attempt to make his mark on a world that didn\u0026rsquot fully understand him."},{"url":null,"title":"england-sink-sweden-to-reach-semi-finals-at-world-cup-how-the-papers-reacted","story":"  \u0026ldquoPrince Harry! declares the Mail on Sunday Sport after Harry Maguire headed home his first international goal to kick off the scoring in England\u0026rsquos 2-0 victory over Sweden.

But backbench Tory Brexiteers hit out at the plans, with speculation at Westminster that some could be prepared to submit formal letters calling for a leadership contest.  Meanwhile, it emerged that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson backed the proposals at Chequers despite claiming that defending the plans was like \u0026ldquopolishing a turd.  Despite his reservations, Mr Johnson fell into line along with the rest of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos Brexit-backing ministers.  Tory MP Andrew Bridgen compared the Foreign Secretary to Neville Chamberlain, accusing him of \u0026ldquowaving the white flag of appeasement in the direction of Brussels, along with other Brexiteer ministers.  Meanwhile, the Sunday Times reported that in a draft leadership letter circulating in Westminster, rebel Tories accuse the Prime Minister of letting the negotiations with Brussels descend \u0026ldquointo a state of complete capitulation.

Mr Bridgen, writing in the Mail on Sunday, said Jacob Rees-Mogg \u0026ndash leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group \u0026ndash was now the only credible challenger to Mrs May after the failure by Cabinet ministers to oppose the Chequers plan.  In a message to the Cabinet, he said: \u0026ldquoAll those harbouring leadership hopes have done their ambitions fatal harm.  \u0026ldquoGrassroots party members will have no truck with their perceived treachery.  \u0026ldquoSome will try to keep their leadership hopes alive by claiming it was not the time to quit and they had a duty to stay on to ensure Brexit is not further watered down.  \u0026ldquoBut it leaves only one credible contender with the integrity and backbone to follow Mrs May: Jacob Rees-Mogg.  But Mrs May told the Sunday Times:\u0026nbsp \u0026ldquoThe only challenge that needs to be made now is to the European Union to get serious about this, to come round the table and discuss it with us.  The Prime Minister will address Tory MPs on Monday and her chief of staff Gavin Barwell has been engaged in efforts to explain the Chequers deal to concerned colleagues alongside Chief Whip Julian Smith.  Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told the Sunday  the Chequers plan appeared to amount to \u0026ldquocontinued membership of the customs union and single market for goods despite the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos promise to leave both.  \u0026ldquoIf the public perceive that not to be delivered then the Government, I\u0026rsquom afraid, will suffer the consequences at the next election, he said.  Mr Rees-Mogg warned that \u0026ldquoa\u0026nbspvery soft Brexit means that we haven\u0026rsquot left, we are simply a rule-taker.  \u0026ldquoThat is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised, he told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today.  An analysis of the Chequers statement circulating within the ERG was damning about the plans.  The Chequers proposals \u0026ldquolead directly to a worst-of-all-worlds \u0026lsquoblack hole\u0026rsquo Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state in the EU\u0026rsquos legal and regulatory tarpit, the briefing by Martin Howe QC concluded.  The document has not been endorsed by the ERG but was \u0026ldquodevastating, a Brexiteer source said.  The plans agreed at Chequers would create a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook.

Now, three weeks later, the two sides were still at odds on all issues, including exactly what denuclearisation means and how it might be verified, after a third visit to Pyongyang by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  Mr Pompeo wrapped up two days of talks in the North Korean capital on Saturday on an optimistic note even without meeting Kim Jong Un, as he had on his previous two trips.  He said his discussions had been productive and conducted in good faith, but he allowed that much more work needed to be done.  He and other US officials said the two countries, still technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War, had set up working groups to deal with details of an agreement.          Three weeks since the Singapore Summit, my team has worked tirelessly to keep the conversation moving forward. pic.twitter/joMcgWDRxc          \u0026mdash Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) July 6, 2018  Mr Pompeo said he had won commitments for new discussions on denuclearisation and announced a Thursday meeting between US and North Korean military officials on the repatriation of the remains.  But in a harsh response issued just hours after Mr Pompeo arrived in Tokyo, the North blasted the discussions, saying the visit had been \u0026ldquoregrettable and that Washington\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquogangster-like demands were aimed at forcing it to abandon nuclear weapons.  In a statement carried by the North\u0026rsquos official Korean Central News Agency, the foreign ministry said the outcome of Mr Pompeo\u0026rsquos talks with senior official Kim Yong Chol was \u0026ldquovery concerning because it has led to a \u0026ldquodangerous phase that might rattle our willingness for denuclearisation that had been firm.  \u0026ldquoWe had expected that the US side would offer constructive measures that would help build trust based on the spirit of the leaders\u0026rsquo summit \u0026hellip we were also thinking about providing reciprocal measures, it said.  \u0026ldquoHowever, the attitude and stance the United States showed in the first high-level meeting (between the countries) was no doubt regrettable. Our expectations and hopes were so naive it could be called foolish.  It said the North had raised the issue of formally ending the Korean War, which concluded with an armistice and not a peace treaty, but the US came up with a variety of \u0026ldquoconditions and excuses to delay a declaration.  It downplayed the significance of the United States suspending its military exercises with South Korea, something trumpeted by Mr Trump after the summit as a success, by saying it made a larger concession by blowing up the tunnels at a nuclear test site.  In criticising the talks with MR Pompeo, however, it carefully avoided attacking Mr Trump personally, saying \u0026ldquowe wholly maintain our trust toward President Trump, but stressed that Washington must not allow \u0026ldquoheadwinds against the \u0026ldquowills of the leaders.          .@SecPompeo addresses reporters following two days of meetings in #DPRK. pic.twitter/c7QISHYFNl          \u0026mdash Department of State (@StateDept) July 7, 2018  That appeared to be a reference to Mr Trump\u0026rsquos national security adviser John Bolton, a prominent North Korea hawk who has been vilified by Pyongyang in the past.  Mr Pompeo spoke with Mr Trump, Mr Bolton and White House chief of staff John Kelly on Saturday before his second round of meetings with Kim Yong Chol.  The North\u0026rsquos statement, coming so soon after Mr Pompeo\u0026rsquos trip, was sure to fuel growing scepticism in the US over how serious Kim Jong Un is about giving up his nuclear arsenal.  A former top US diplomat for Asia, Daniel Russel, said the setback was to be expected and warned Mr Trump he is engaged in a long negotiation that would not produce easy quick, made for television results that the president likely wants.  \u0026ldquoDealing with North Korea is hard because Kim Jong Un wants it to be hard, said Mr Russel, who was assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Obama administration.  \u0026ldquoIf you make the Americans fight for every inch, the Americans will start measuring progress in inches \u0026mdash and will wind up paying by the inch. At this point, even to get the North Koreans to follow through with the return of Korean War-era MIA remains, would feel like a big win for Pompeo, even though it wouldn\u0026rsquot affect the nuclear threat.  \u0026ldquoKim can afford to play hardball because it\u0026rsquos clear to him that Trump, who has already told Americans they can sleep soundly because the threat is now over, badly wants a deal, Mr Russel said. \u0026ldquoAnd when you want it bad, you get it bad. Why should the North Koreans make concessions to one of Trump\u0026rsquos aides given the president\u0026rsquos record of undercutting them?

He stressed that \u0026ldquothere\u0026rsquos still more work to be done in others, which will be handled by the working groups.  He said North Korea said it offered to discuss the closure of a missile engine test site, which would \u0026ldquophysically affirm a move to halt the production of intercontinental range ballistic missiles, that the two sides had agreed that a Pentagon team would meet North Korean officials on or about Thursday at the border between North and South Korea to discuss the repatriation of remains.  However, in the days following the June 12 summit with Kim Jong Un in Singapore, Mr Trump had already announced the return of the remains and the destruction of the missile facility had been completed or were in progress.  Mr Pompeo said more talks were needed on both."},{"url":null,"title":"tory-brexiteers-urged-to-back-pm-over-chequers-compromise","story":"  Brexiteer Cabinet minister Michael Gove admitted the plan, which will see the UK tied to EU rules on goods, was not everything he had hoped for but he was a \u0026ldquorealist and the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos lack of a Commons majority meant the \u0026ldquoparliamentary arithmetic was a factor in deciding what could be adopted.  All members of the Cabinet have signed up to the proposals, but backbench Brexiteers have hit out at the plans, with speculation at Westminster that some could be prepared to submit formal letters calling for a leadership contest.  Meanwhile, it emerged that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson backed the proposals at Chequers despite claiming that defending the plans was like \u0026ldquopolishing a turd during the meeting.  Mr Gove said the Prime Minister \u0026ldquoallowed us, during the course of a day, to share views, to share analyses and to look at this proposal in detail but at the end of it collective responsibility reigns.  Mr Gove said the compromise plan was a \u0026ldquoperfect balance between the need for close access to Europe and the ability for the services industry to diverge.  Asked if it was everything he hoped for, Mr Gove told BBC\u0026rsquos Andrew Marr Show: \u0026ldquoNo, but then I\u0026rsquom a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn\u0026rsquot, you shouldn\u0026rsquot make the perfect the enemy of the good.

The Prime Minister faces a potentially stormy meeting with Tory MPs on Monday evening, with reports that letters calling for a leadership contest have been submitted to the backbench 1922 Committee.

Efforts to build support for the plan will see MPs invited to attend presentations organised by Chief Whip Julian Smith and Mrs May\u0026rsquos chief of staff Gavin Barwell.  Mr Gove was not the only Cabinet minister trying to win over critics.  A joint column written by Chancellor Philip Hammond and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling in the Sunday  said: \u0026ldquoWhat was agreed at Chequers on Friday night is a pragmatic as well as a principled Brexit deal, one that works for both the EU and the UK.  But former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told the Sunday  the Chequers plan appeared to amount to \u0026ldquocontinued membership of the customs union and single market for goods despite the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos promise to leave both.  \u0026ldquoIf the public perceive that not to be delivered then the Government, I\u0026rsquom afraid, will suffer the consequences at the next election, he said.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Sunday 8 Jul 2018 11:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal. One is 4.6 kilometres long and the other 2.7 kilometres.They will be used by Shell to develop the potential reserves in the Penguins field.Subsea7\u0026rsquos local site manager, Willie Watt, said: \u0026ldquoWe would be looking to make a start on this project by the autumn of next year and launch in the late spring of 2020.\u0026ldquoThis is very good news for the site and for Caithness. It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back. The last bundle we did for them was in 2003.\u0026ldquoIt is an important project and shows pipeline bundles are the preference for developing the North Sea sector. It is the right product at the right time.The Statoil order will include pipeline bundles and control umbilicals required for the development.The Snorre field is sited within the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.Since the last pipeline was launched in Caithness in March last year, the company has refurbished the rail track which is used to transport the bundles to the sea and on to the tugs before being taken to their destination.Sunday 8 Jul 2018 11:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116401.jpg","title":"Sunny conditions set to continue all week in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCAITHNESS and other parts of the north are set to enjoy more dry and settled conditions under gin-blue skies coupled with virtually unbroken sunshine for the remainder of the week and beyond.On Sunday afternoon the air temperature in Wick peaked at 21.6C (70.9F).\u0026nbspLast Thursday morning the town witnessed a high of 22.5C (72.5F), making it the warmest day in the burgh for any day in June since 2011.The highest temperature recorded in Wick since 1910 is currently 26.7C (80.1F), witnessed on June 6, 1939.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Sunday 8 Jul 2018 11:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

This follows a wave of criticism towards bus services in the county, which saw members of the public brand Stagecoach \u0026#8220a disgrace.\u0026#8221The hearing was called to consider failings in relation to the provision of contracted school services and local bus services, many of which were caused by vehicle breakdowns. The traffic commissioner was concerned about the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and presentation.In particular she heard evidence from the Stagecoach Managing Director in Scotland, Mr Robert Andrew, who took the opportunity to apologise in public to OIC officials for the company’s failures. The inquiry also saw representatives from the council give evidence.After hearing this evidence, as well as making a visit to the bus operator’s Kirkwall depot, Miss Aitken also made an order to reduce the number of vehicles authorised on licence held by Highland Country Buses Ltd — the subsidiary of Stagecoach which serves the Highlands and Islands. Of the 210 vehicles which had been licensed, 30 will  now be unlicensed until Miss Aitken is satisfied with the compliance of the company to its licenses and contracts.In response to this, Stagecoach North Scotland managing director, David Liston, said: \u0026#8220We understand the importance of reliable and high-quality bus services to local communities in the Highlands and Islands.\u0026#8220Since these issues arose, we have taken steps to ensure that there are robust maintenance and operational processes in place across our business in the north of Scotland, and we are continuing to focus in particular on fleet reliability and presentation.\u0026#8220We understand the frustrations local people have at times expressed and we would like to reassure our customers that we are working hard to deliver better bus services. In her decision, the Traffic Commissioner has asked that we make a contribution totalling £20,500 to the schools in Orkney, and we are happy to do so.\u0026#8220We are currently arranging for this sum to be paid to Orkney Islands Council for onward payment to the schools.\u0026#8221The Traffic commissioner has clarified that this payment of  £20,500 is not compensatory in nature and does not affect any contractual obligations between the Council and Stagecoach. It is, rather, an ex gratia payment. The Traffic Commissioner decided on this course of action rather than ordering a payment to be made to Scottish Government.This sum is to be split between schools in the county:Orkney Islands Council has responded positively to this decision by the traffic commissioner.\u0026#8220We welcome the outcome of the public inquiry called by the Traffic Commissioner held in Kirkwall on June 5, particularly the decision to distribute the payment locally to our schools,\u0026#8221 a council spokeswoman said.\u0026#8220We’ll continue to work closely with the Traffic Commissioner and Stagecoach on service improvements.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to. Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos nieces and nephews from as far afield as the Canary Islands, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Sussex headed north for the event.Her birthday cake, baked by a relative, was shaped as an artist\u0026rsquos palette to represent one of her great passions in life.Mrs Foster was born in Surrey and spent her childhood with her three siblings in Kent, where her father had a grocery business.She started her working life in an office at a department store and then worked as a secretary mainly with legal firms, in England and Edinburgh.Mrs Foster said she and her husband Tony had been \"gradually moving up the country\" before settling in their cottage in Muir of Ord. Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

It is not clear why the paving moved but the extreme heat is suspected to be the cause.\"Meanwhile, emergency services were also called into action to tackle wildfires, including one in the Coulhill area of Alness on Tuesday.Firefighters were called to the scene of the 1000sqm blaze at around 10.30am, and remained on the scene for several hours before the fire was brought under control.And farmers in the area have voiced concerns that straw supplies could be set to run out amid the ongoing dry spell, with the National Farmers\u0026rsquo Union urging members to be proactive in negotiating reasonable prices.Sunday 8 Jul 2018 11:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765653.1530992976!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm laws governing eu referendum proved meaningless","story":"        Without a criminal sanction or  the threat of a re-run, Vote Leave can cock a snook at the Electoral Commission, says Euan McColm                Imagine you’re unhappy with your television. The screen’s too small, the sound’s terrible and, frankly, nobody much enjoyed watching that last match round at your place.            There’s only one thing for it: you’re going to have to shell out a couple of grand on a new one.            Unfortunately, you’ve already spent the last of your savings on lottery tickets and artisan gin so the need for a TV simply cannot be met with the \u2028resources you have available. So what do you do?You could do the right thing and save a bit, maybe buy a new flat-screen next year, or you could, I suppose, stroll confidently into John Lewis, unhook a fancy Sony from the wall and march out with it under your arm.And, if a security guard stopped you by the front door, you could try explaining that it was the will of the people that you had a new TV.You wouldn’t do that, though, would you? There’s a law against you stealing things, even when you really, really want them. If you get caught in the act, you don’t get to keep your ill-gotten gains, you get to visit your local police station and you get to have a criminal record that might well ruin your life.Steal a referendum result, on the other hand, and – even if you get caught – you get to keep your winnings.            READ MORE: Official Brexit campaign ‘broke electoral law’Last week, the Vote Leave campaign, which celebrated victory in the 2016 EU referendum, leaked news that the Electoral Commission was set to find it breached electoral law during the Brexit referendum.In what appeared to be an effort to take back control of this particular story, this particular group of  Brexiteers let it be known that the commission had accused them of breaking their official spending limit of £7 million by passing donations to another campaign group – BeLeave – with which it was allegedly co-ordinating operations.If, indeed, Vote Leave did break electoral law during the campaign, one might be forgiven for expecting that there would be some pretty serious consequences.             After all, ignoring the law in order to win a referendum that will change the course of British history might be considered a more serious matter than half-inching a telly.If the law on spending limits – put in place (and here’s a laugh) to stop the wealthy simply buying victories – really meant anything, there would be police involvement. As it is, this piece of civil, rather than criminal, law is utterly worthless.The toughest sanction available to the electoral commission is the imposition of a fine of up to £20,000. To a millionaire campaigner willing to ignore the law, that might seem like very good value indeed.The spin from pro-Brexit politicians, campaigners, and commentators is that none of this had any impact on the result of the referendum a majority would have voted Leave, regardless of the amount any of the participants had spent. If this is so, one wonders why they felt the need to spend anything on the campaign at all.Remainers hoping that the Electoral Commission’s findings might have some impact on the result are to be disappointed.             It’s no wonder Vote Leave was so relaxed about revealing some of the detail of its own alleged misdeeds.But this scandal – and it is a bloody scandal, regardless of how it might be dismissed by the braying Brexiteers of Little England – should have consequences for future elections and referendums. It is time for spending on campaigns to be a matter of criminal rather than civil law.I fear, however, that we will see little appetite for this necessary change from the main political parties.It is an open secret that participants in elections regularly ignore the rules and regulations that are supposed to ensure financial fair play. As one campaigner put it to me last week: “We all do it and nobody wants to make an issue of it. If we start throwing accusations at our opponents, they’ll start throwing accusations at us. Everyone’s hands are dirty.”This cosy, all-in-the-sewer-together understanding makes a mockery of already toothless legislation surrounding spending limits.An especially bleak irony of the electoral commission’s findings, as leaked by Vote Leave, is that the Brexit campaign was driven by a populist message that departure from the EU would empower those who felt left behind by “political elites” or “the establishment” when the reality, it appears, is that the only people truly empowered by it are a financial elite whose contempt for the law (for what it is currently worth, which is nothing) is out there in the open, now, for all to see.When those who value “Britishness” talk about what it actually means, they will tell you that they pride themselves on our collective sense of fair play.If those Brexiteers who made so much about British values during the 2016 campaign truly meant what they say, they would be clamouring for a re-run of the referendum. A result obtained by murky means, with the law ignored, is surely fundamentally un-British, isn’t it?Anyone who dares to question the validity of a victory secured by a campaign that broke electoral law should expect to be dismissed as an out-of-touch “Remoaner”. The rag-bag of libertarians, right-wing obsessives, and downright racists who are currently pushing for Brexit at any cost will have their way.I can’t see any good reason that anyone – regardless of their political position – would oppose turning the regulation of campaign funding from a civil to a criminal matter. After all, don’t we all want to ensure the high standards politicians talk about to be a reality rather than just another bit of meaningless spin?The EU referendum result will have consequences for generations to come. Those who secured that victory may consider themselves very fortunate indeed that the law governing the way the referendum was conducted is meaningless."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765532.1530903746!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mclellan closing private schools makes inequality worse","story":"        Pricing out middle-class will create ever-more exclusive institutions, writes John McLellan.                Class warriors of the nation rejoice: one bourgeois institution down, just 69 to go. That bastion of inequality and privilege in Central Scotland, Beaconhurst School, is no more. Cliftonhall, Lomond, St Columba’s ... we’re coming for you next.            In the face of increasing pressure on costs and fees, and the prospect of the loss of charitable rates relief in 2020-21, Beaconhurst announced a merger with Morrison’s Academy, 20 miles away in Crieff, with the hope that its Bridge of Allan campus could be maintained for its junior school pupils in a satellite operation.            But by Wednesday the game was up. The school conceded the exodus of families making their own arrangements – many would have been put off by the prospect of a 40-mile round-trip to the senior school and Dollar Academy is nearer – meant the deal was no longer viable. Beaconhurst will cease to exist and the buildings will probably be sold for development, almost certainly houses, given how quickly a nearby Cala estate sold out. Regular trains to Glasgow and Edinburgh mean Bridge of Allan and Dunblane properties go for Edinburgh prices.Beaconhurst joins Westbourne, Laurel Bank, St Denis and Cranley and, eight years ago, St Margaret’s in Edinburgh, on the list of defunct private schools and it won’t be the last if the rate of fee increases continues to outstrip earnings and closes off the option for more families. Not that independent schools ever expect much sympathy from the Scottish political establishment, but in the last academic year the sector has been subjected to sustained pressure, particularly the confirmation in December of the Scottish Government’s plan to end charitable rates relief.READ MORE: Beaconhurst school in Bridge of Allan ‘likely to close’ following mergerThe argument that the tax change only addressed an anomaly – whereby state schools did not receive rates relief and paid the full amount – was a red herring because the payment was just an accounting device in which councils effectively paid themselves from one part of their books to another.            With a bill totalling about £5m a year for the sector, the impact on fees has been estimated at between £200-£300 a year on day fees of £12,000, or about two per cent. With fee increases now running well ahead of inflation, such as the five per cent just announced at George Watson’s, by the time charitable relief disappears senior school day fees could easily be hitting £14,000. For families with two children at senior school, finding £28,000 represents a net weekly income of £538 which is just £56 below the average UK household income, according to the latest “Living Standards, Poverty and Inequality” report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies. On the reasonable presumption that the average UK family does not have two kids at private school, it’s a fair guess that to meet school fees on top of all other living costs will require a net weekly income of just over £1,000, which is into the top five percent of earnings and a gross income in the region of £70,000. Even in a wealthy city like Edinburgh where a quarter of the total school population, over 11,000 children, are privately educated, that’s a lot of families who have to be right at the top of the wages league over a long period of time for this to be sustainable.Private school critics, like Labour’s Lord George Foulkes and Green MSP Andy Wightman, will shed few tears at the prospect of more parents rejecting the private option because of cost, but far from tackling inequality it will only make it worse as the offspring of the ultra-affluent are concentrated in fewer, more exclusive institutions bankrolled by international elites.Deliberately squeezing private education through punitive taxes is also a disincentive for the schools to increase their work with the state sector, calling into question collaborative projects like the Swire Chinese Language Centre Edinburgh at George Watson’s, a joint venture with James Gillespie’s and Boroughmuir. It’s now being extended to other schools. At the same time, Edinburgh council couldn’t even build the new Boroughmuir big enough to meet its basic needs in the coming years. The list of joint projects between private and state is lengthy and benefits both, but the unfortunate lesson of last year for the independent sector is why go to the trouble when the reward is a political kicking?             READ MORE: John McLellan: A strange obsession with expensive tramsA bursary to inspireA former contributor to The Scotsman’s sports pages, the teacher, ex-Hutchesons’ Grammar depute rector, and latterly popular after-dinner-speaker, Sandy Strang died after a very short illness last year and the school has just announced the establishment of the Sandy Strang Bursary Project thanks to a donation of £100,000 from his estate.The school needs to raise a minimum of a further £300,000 to build a sustainable fund, which will be used to widen access to more pupils from less well-off backgrounds and hopes Strang’s mantra that “much is expected from those to whom much is given” will inspire the hundreds of people he influenced as a teacher to donate. I‘m in.Booty-licious route to a job            If there was one thing Sandy Strang understood, it was rigorous application, and a couple of weeks ago I wrote about the importance of university graduates understanding their degree classifications were worth less than a CV packed with extra-curricular activities and work experience. Not so at The Spectator magazine, run by this paper’s former political editor, Fraser Nelson, where a strict “no CVs” policy applies to applications for paid internships.Sandy would have appreciated the stiff set of tasks set for hopefuls, such as provide “a one-page summary on the dismal state of the German military” and “suggest three guests for a podcast discussion on the recent Slovakian crisis”. But he would have loved the demand for “socioeconomic support for any two Beyoncé lyrics”. Like, perhaps, Booty-licious?Says Nelson: “We don’t care where, when or even whether you went to university.” But what if you don’t like Beyoncé?Anyone but England\u2028And finally to Russia and this afternoon’s big game, which Cambridge football blue Strang would have relished. An English friend on business in Dublin earlier this week was treated to some World Cup wisdom from a local taxi driver bemoaning the lack of an Irish presence. “I’m supporting whoever is playing England, but don’t get me wrong I want England to win ...

The Prime Minister said the plan thrashed out with the Cabinet was aimed at making sure “we deliver on Brexit for the people because I won’t let people down”.            Mrs May insisted that the UK would regain control of its borders, but refused to rule out giving EU citizens preferential treatment under the future immigration policy.            The Prime Minister’s inner circle is trying to secure support for the proposals to create a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a “common rulebook”.READ MORE: It’s ‘game on’ for keeping UK in single marketCabinet Brexiteers have already been persuaded to support the plans after the marathon session of talks at Chequers on Friday, but backbench Eurosceptics have expressed grave doubts.The common rulebook for goods, including food and agricultural products, could limit the UK’s ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Full details will be published in a white paper on Thursday, with Brussels expecting a round of negotiations in the week commencing July 16.            The Prime Minister told the BBC: “We’re leaving the European Union. I think when people voted to leave the European Union, they wanted an end to free movement - free movement will end.“They wanted us to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK - that will end.“They wanted us to stop sending the vast sums of money every year to the EU that we do today, and so take control of our money, our laws and our borders - and that’s exactly what we will do.“But we’ll do it in a way that protects drops and enhances our economy for the future.”            Repeatedly pressed on whether the new immigration system would offer preferential access to EU citizens, Mrs May said: “We need to look at that in the context of the wider rules we have for immigration from outside of the European Union and we will decide the rules that are right for the UK.”The Prime Minister said that “collective responsibility has returned” to the Cabinet after the Chequers deal and it was now important to get on with negotiating with the EU.“Up till now what we’ve seen from Europe are the proposals that they’ve effectively put to us of being ones that we couldn’t accept,” she said.She said there was a “willingness to sit down and talk” about the plans.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he was looking forward to the publication of the white paper and the EU would consider whether the proposals are “workable and realistic”.            As well as potentially difficult talks ahead with Brussels,  Mrs May also faces the task of winning over Eurosceptic backbenchers.Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the influential European Research Group of pro-Brexit Conservative MPs, warned that a common rulebook could make “trade deals almost impossible” if it meant regulations would have to apply to any goods coming into the UK.He added that “it is possible that this deal is worse” than a “no deal” Brexit.“An egg that is very softly boiled isn’t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven’t left, we are simply a rule-taker,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.”Backbencher Andrea Jenkyns said she was “awaiting the detail” of the plans before deciding whether to support calls for a leadership contest.Tories are being invited to briefings about the plans, with the Prime Minister set to address Conservative MPs at a meeting in Parliament on Monday.The first briefing was led by Chief Whip Julian Smith and the Prime Minister’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell, with 10 Tory MPs attending the Saturday morning session.James Cleverly, a deputy chairman of the party, said: “I went in there with some concerns as a Brexiteer and I come out with those concerns addressed.”He said the briefings “will massively calm the nerves of people who have been basing their views on the speculation that has been floating around in the media and social media”.Vicky Ford urged colleagues not to get “too hot under the collar” until they had seen the details.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling acknowledged the plans could cause “issues” in future trade talks.Asked what the common rulebook with the EU on food products would mean for the proposed US trade deal, Mr Grayling told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There may be individual issues to address in future trade talks.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke to Mrs May about the plans on Saturday.He said he “welcomed proposals from British Government which can input into talks on the future relationship”.“Await detail in white paper late next week before agreeing an EU position,” he said."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765692.1530987304!/image/image.jpg","title":"independent scotland could offer raf lossiemouth to nato","story":"        An independent Scotland should offer RAF Lossiemouth to Nato so that it could be run as an airbase by the nuclear alliance, a former defence adviser to the SNP has said.

Crawford told Scotland on Sunday that turning RAF Lossiemouth into a Nato airbase would see the defence alliance provide an independent Scotland with a ready-made maritime patrol and fast jet force to defend the strategically important “High North”.The SNP has already expressed concern that the UK government is failing to do enough to protect the areas to the north of Scotland from Russian incursions.Crawford said the presence of Nato aircraft at Lossiemouth would remove the need for an independent Scotland’s defence force to purchase its own expensive patrol and fighter aircraft.He added that a Nato airbase, similar to the one in Ramstein in Germany, would bring significant investment to rural Scotland.“There would be considerable investment from Nato in setting something like this up,” said Crawford. “Lossiemouth would no longer be a domestic airbase in a country that happens to be a Nato member, but would be a base specifically for Nato operations.”             “It would seem to me to bring about the double benefit of both providing on-site air defence in terms of fast jet and maritime patrol for Scotland plus the economic benefit from the investment to enable Lossiemouth to be a true Nato base. That would involve the infrastructure for non-British Nato personnel, who would be posted there on a semi-permanent basis.”He added: “Another benefit for Scotland would be that an independent Scotland’s defence forces would not need fast jet aircraft of that type, which would help, given a limited defence budget.”Crawford claimed the idea had been discussed in SNP circles but the party had not adopted it as policy.The SNP’s attitude towards Nato has been a controversial area for the party in the past. Historically it was opposed to Nato membership, because the vast majority of members are implacably opposed to nuclear weapons.            Ahead of the 2014 independence referendum, the SNP conference narrowly voted in favour of dropping its long-standing opposition to Nato after a passionate debate that exposed splits in the party on the issue.At the time, the SNP leadership under Angus Robertson felt the party had to embrace the defence alliance even though it disapproved of its commitment to nuclear weapons. The vote was held because those at the top of the party believed the SNP’s anti-Nato stance was a vote loser with the public at large.Crawford acknowledged that many within the SNP still viewed Nato with deep suspicion. But he said: “If a small country with a population of five and a half million wants to be independent, turning your back on Nato is not very clever.“The fact that Nato ties the USA and Canada into European defence issues means it is the only game in town at the moment.”As far as Lossiemouth’s location was concern, Crawford argued that it had “easy access” to the North Sea and North Atlantic.            “It is ideally located for the High North. There is increased acknowledgement that the High North has deposits of minerals, oil and gas which are strategically important. If you look at the countries which border on the High North, Russia is one of the biggest ones. It may be that increased Russian activities in terms of their submarine operations and their air surveillance operations in the High North, is allied to their recognition of the strategic importance in relation to what that region might contain resources wise.”Over the years, Nato allies have deployed many aircraft to RAF Lossiemouth. For example, 37 aircraft from the US, Germany and France were temporarily deployed to Moray in 2016. This was a 76 per cent increase on the previous year when 21 Nato aircraft were deployed.SNP defence spokesman Stewart McDonald refused to be drawn on Crawford’s proposal.McDonald said: “I’m not going to get into that, because we are working on stuff looking at independence and I don’t want to get tied into that because all of that is a project that’s on-going.“Sometimes Stuart Crawford has good ideas, sometimes he has not so good ideas. I am trying to get to a situation where we start talking about defence in an independent Scotland that built on the last case, and I am not yet in the position where I want to start having a public conversation on it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more seabirds entangled but fishing industry not always to blame says tour guide ","story":"\nDarron Smith cuts free a gannet.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16?

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study
