Photographer Diana Bagnoli followed the lavish first communions produced by Ivana and Miriam Pipolo in Naplesby Diana Bagnoli and Marzia MaurielloNine-year-old Maria wakes up and can’t wait for her party day to get started, after the first communion sacrament she received the day before. When the photographers and the videomakers arrive at her home, she slips into her bedroom and puts on some makeup to welcome the guests. She is ready for the day she will never forget.First communion in Naples is not just a religious sacrament but is experienced as an important rite of passage to be properly celebrated, and a community event with many levels of interpretation and meaning, not just limited to religion.For the young person involved and for their family the holy communion is filled with social and moral public obligations to be fulfilled, from wearing expensive clothes to providing banquets and putting on spectacular stage shows with bands singing modern Neapolitan pop music.In recent years, communions have often become more important than weddings, especially for parents who have had children before marriage. The celebration of their child’s communion becomes the feast of their dreams, the one they did not have for their wedding, and it is also perceived as an entrance into society.Even though in 1910 the Pope reduced the age for receiving the sacrament from 10-14 years old to seven, the first communion in the social context appears to be still related to the arrival of puberty, especially for the female communicants, often called spose bambine (child brides). They are in fact dressed, embellished and treated like young brides, with elaborate and expensive dresses made in the city’s best ateliers.In this photographic project Diana Bagnoli follows the daughters of the famous photographer of events and ceremonies, Oreste Pipolo, called “the shaman of weddings”. His daughters, Ivana and Miriam, inherited their father’s studio and, like him, they sell a dream, building elaborate photo sets before, during and after the first communion day.All the big expenditures – banquets, dresses, entertainments, photo shoots and so on – serve to convey a sense of social worth and to mark, or sometimes re-establish, the status of the communicant’s family within the local community. There is also a competitive element in displaying and sharing your goods with the community members and putting on the best and most lavish show.Such behaviour appears to be particularly related to a social milieu that is historically connected to poverty to show economic capacity may mean power but also social improvement. And it is also related to the high level of “theatricality” of Neapolitans in the public space, as observed by anthropologists who have done fieldwork in Naples – including myself, having carried out ethnographic work in this city for more than a decade.The celebration of the first communion, as it involves young children and the whole community, holds a great social meaning. It is a premise and a promise for future success. And it has to be a day to remember forever.Diana Bagnoli is a freelance portrait and social reportage photographer based in Italy.Marzia Mauriello is an anthropology research fellow at the University of Naples L’orientale, focusing on construction, deconstruction and representation of gender identities in the contemporary world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14ab45e70b5553c16a868fa114a5d62096fdc74d/50_102_1998_1199/master/1998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84920c187134cec43baa9f57500124a6","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Forest fires in Indonesia, protests in Hong Kong, climate demonstrations and the World Athletic Championships – the past seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f1b74973b57fe43df5c8ef58ea8273f5293e8b8/0_65_4632_2779/master/4632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=536bb34dd545f3f9b4f911f76bc62e7f","title":"sailing trio back on dry land after south pacific ordeal","story":"Seasoned sailors were picked up after their boat sank off the coast of New Caledonia Three sailors who were rescued by a cruise ship when their yacht went down in the Pacific Ocean say they are relieved to have made it back to dry land.Seasoned Newcastle sailors Chris Doran, his cousin Kevin Doran and Ben Johnson, from Vanuatu, had spent months in the South Pacific and were headed back to Queensland when their boat, Liberty, struck a discarded mooring line about 5.30am on Thursday and began to sink.The men told friends they were leaving Vanuatu for the Gold Coast on Monday. The journey is a popular one with Australian sailors and takes five days of round-the-clock sailing in good weather, longer with stops and day sailing.The P\u0026ampO cruise ship Pacific Dawn picked up their emergency beacon and collected the men several hours later near the coast of New Caledonia, without even having to alter its route.“Initially we thought we might have hit a reef but that wasn’t the case,” Chris Doran told reporters in Brisbane after the cruise ship docked on Saturday morning.“We found quite a large ship’s rope, there was about 50 metres of it and it wrapped around both propellers causing a breach in the hull, the boat started taking on water.”Realising their boat was going under, the men made a May Day call, grabbed their passports and some water before piling into a life raft.Doran told reporters he had sailed the Liberty for six years and was sorry to lose it, but knew it could not be saved.More pressing was the risk the lifeboat would be overturned in rough seas, or float dangerously toward the reef, which was just six nautical miles — 11km — away.“I wasn’t worried about the boat because we couldn’t save it, there was no way we could’ve saved it,” he told Nine newspapers.Doran said they maintained constant radio contact with the Pacific Dawn’s captain Alan Dockeray, who picked up the distress call when he was 55 nautical miles from their location. It was a very easy rescue, Dockeray said. Dockeray had been piloting 2,000 passengers in a seven-day cruise around the South Pacific and said he had rescued sailors from the waters around Vanuatu before.“The reefs there are unforgiving but these guys didn’t find a reef, they found a mooring line,” Dockeray said.Johnson told Nine News from aboard the Pacific Dawn on Thursday that the rope “completely ripped through the bottom of the hull”.“From there it was just panic stations, and we had manual pumps going, bilge pumps going,” he said.“So we abandoned, we abandoned ship by then because it was already lifting and she was in ... very bad shape.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71843dd1e1e61a7f18d0bd503a57c850d65ae900/0_42_6455_3873/master/6455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5085870f352d591f1f3dc03aa72b54c5","title":"a quick ting on launches young black authors","story":"A groundbreaking new black British history series will explore subjects from Afrobeats to the power movement. Meet the young minds behind the booksAuthors often say “write the book you want to read” and Zainab Kwaw-Swanzy has done just that. She “would have loved to have” a history of the black-girl afro when she was younger, she says: the 25-year-old’s book will explore the personal and political histories of the hairstyle, as part of a groundbreaking new series by young people about the history of black Britain.“Myself and almost everyone I know has had their own personal journey relating to afro hair. It’s not just hair – it can be political, it can be a statement, so many things,” says Kwaw-Swanzy, a founding member of award-winning magazine gal-dem. “There was a time when lots of products weren’t available and there wasn’t a lot of education out there about how to manage this hair best, because it’s not the norm in our country. So to have a book that explains why it is important would have probably helped me learn to love my own hair a lot quicker than I did.”Kwaw-Swanzy’s is one book in A Quick Ting On, a groundbreaking new non-fiction series focused on the black British community, all written by young black British writers. Created by 24-year-old publisher Magdalene Abraha, the series is the first of its kind and will cover topics from grime music to bamboo earrings, plantain to the black British power movement, Afrobeats to black British business.“There’s nothing like this out there – that’s one of the reasons why I had to do it,” says Abraha. “I created this series to provide a space that can celebrate, pay homage and explore culture. It’s about the everyday conversations that we have about art, music, hair, history, politics, food and so much more.”Everyone she approached – often by WhatsApp – to write for A Quick Ting On is making their publishing debut. All are under 30, and Abraha describes them as a collective.“They’re embarking on this writing journey together, learning to do it together in the form of a series, which I think is really powerful,” she says. “It was really important to me to launch it with young, passionate, debut black writers, and to work on developing them.”Christian Adofo, 29, is writing A Quick Ting On Afrobeats, and believes the series will be “a seed that allows us to represent ourselves unapologetically … Growing up in the UK while having roots in Africa and the Caribbean is a nuanced and ever-shifting experience, especially as you reach the age at which your parents migrated here and you begin to emphasise the sacrifice and foresight for your own future,” he says. “I want readers to acknowledge the influence of the transatlantic slave trade that follows a similar route to the music. This constant feedback between Africa, the Caribbean and the west is rich, which effortlessly influences popular culture.”Sophia Tassew, who is writing A Quick Ting On Bamboo Earrings, says: “I feel like this book is not only a win for me but a win for young women who also grew up in a similar environment. This book is a love letter to the women that have raised me, along with a nod to my culture.” Her book will explore how bamboo earrings have been “a point of identity for many black and Latina women but … shunned by the mainstream fashion industry” until recently.Kwaw-Swanzy says she loves that the series could help readers outside black British communities understand the importance of their culture.“Black history tends to be focused around slavery – which was such a big part – but to be able to say there are so many other things that are important to this culture and this country, that’s something I would have loved to know more about in school.

But even when we know that a war for our survival is raging, we don’t feel that it is our war. Although many of climate change’s accompanying calamities – extreme weather events, floods and wildfires, displacement and resource scarcity chief among them – are vivid, personal and suggestive of a worsening situation, they don’t feel that way in aggregate. The distance between awareness and feeling can make it very difficult for even thoughtful and politically engaged people – people who want to act – to act.In 2018, despite knowing more than we have ever known about human-caused climate change, humans produced more greenhouse gases than we’ve ever produced, at a rate three times that of population growth. There are tidy explanations – the growing use of coal in China and India, a strong global economy, unusually severe seasons that required spikes in energy for heating and cooling. But the truth is as crude as it is obvious: we don’t care. So now what?Of course there are some moments when the planetary crisis is acutely felt. Watching Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth was an intellectual and emotional revelation for me. When the screen went dark after the final image, our situation seemed perfectly clear, as did my responsibility to participate in the struggle. And when that film’s credits rolled, at the moment of greatest enthusiasm to do whatever was asked to work against the imminent apocalypse that Gore had just delineated for us, suggested actions appeared on the screen. “Are you ready to change the way you live? The climate crisis can be solved. Here’s how to start.”Among the suggestions were: tell your parents not to ruin the world that you will live in if you are a parent, join with your children to save the world they will live in switch to renewable sources of energy plant trees, lots of trees raise fuel economy standards require lower emissions from automobiles.There is a glaring absence in Gore’s list, and its invisibility recurs in 2017’s An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, with one minuscule exception. It is impossible to explain this omission as accidental without also accusing Gore of a kind of radical ignorance. In terms of the scale of the error, it would be equivalent to a doctor prescribing physical exercise to a patient recovering from a heart attack without also telling him he needs to quit smoking, reduce his stress and stop eating burgers and fries twice a day.So why would Gore deliberately choose to leave this particular issue out? Almost certainly for fear that it would be distractingly controversial and dampen the enthusiasm he had just worked so hard to ignite. It has also been largely absent from the websites of leading environmental advocacy organisations – although this now seems to be changing. It is unmentioned in the celebrated book Dire Predictions, written by the climate scientists Michael E Mann and Lee R Kump. After forecasting existential climate disasters, the authors recommend that we substitute clotheslines for electric dryers and commute by bicycle. Among their suggestions, there is no reference to the everyday process that is, according to the research director of Project Drawdown – a collection of nearly 200 environmental scientists and thought leaders dedicated to identifying solutions to address climate change – “the most important contribution every inidual can make to reversing global warming”.What I am thinking of is the fact that we cannot save the planet unless we significantly reduce our consumption of animal products. This is not my opinion, or anyone’s opinion. It is the inconvenient science. Animal agriculture produces more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire transportation sector (all planes, cars and trains), and is the primary source of methane and nitrous oxide emissions (which are 86 and 310 times more powerful than CO2, respectively). Our meat habit is the leading cause of deforestation, which releases carbon when trees are burned (forests contain more carbon than do all exploitable fossil-fuel reserves), and also diminishes the planet’s ability to absorb carbon. According to a recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, even if we were to do everything else that is necessary to save the planet, it will be impossible to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Accord if we do not dramatically reduce our consumption of animal products.Why is this subject avoided? Conversations about meat, dairy and eggs make people defensive. They make people annoyed. It’s far easier to vilify the fossil fuel industry and its lobbyists – which are without a doubt deserving of our vilification – than to examine our own eating habits. No one who isn’t a vegan is eager to go there, and the eagerness of vegans can be a further turnoff. But we have no hope of tackling climate change if we can’t speak honestly about what is causing it, as well as our potential to change in response.It is hard to talk about our need to eat fewer animal products both because the topic is so fraught and because of the sacrifice involved. Most people like the taste of meat, dairy and eggs. Most people have eaten animal products at almost every meal since they were children, and it’s hard to change lifelong habits, even when they aren’t freighted with pleasure and identity. Those are meaningful challenges, not only worth acknowledging but necessary to acknowledge. Changing the way we eat is simple compared with converting the world’s power grid, or overcoming the influence of powerful lobbyists to pass carbon-tax legislation, or ratifying a significant international treaty on greenhouse gas emissions – but it isn’t simple.I certainly haven’t found it to be effortless. In my early 30s, I spent three years researching factory farming and wrote a book-length rejection of it called Eating Animals. I then spent nearly two years giving hundreds of readings, lectures and interviews on the subject, making the case that factory-farmed meat should not be eaten. So it would be far easier for me not to mention that in difficult periods over the past couple of years – while going through some painful personal experiences, while travelling the country to promote a novel when I was least suited for self-promotion – I ate meat a number of times. Usually burgers. Often at airports. Which is to say, meat from precisely the kinds of farms I argued most strongly against. And my reason for doing so makes my hypocrisy even more pathetic: they brought me comfort. I can imagine this confession eliciting some ironic comments and eye-rolling, and some giddy accusations of fraudulence. I wrote at length, and passionately, about how factory farming tortures animals and destroys the environment. How could I argue for radical change, how could I raise my children as vegetarians, while eating meat for comfort?I wish I had found comfort elsewhere but I am who I am. Even as my commitment to vegetarianism, driven by the issue of animal welfare, has been deepened by a full awareness of meat’s environmental toll, rarely a day has passed when I haven’t craved it. At times I’ve wondered if my strengthening intellectual rejection of it has fuelled a strengthening desire to consume it. Confronting my hypocrisy has reminded me how difficult it is to even try to live my values. Knowing that it will be tough helps make the efforts possible. Efforts, not effort. I cannot imagine a future in which I decide to become a meat-eater again, but I cannot imagine a future in which I don’t want to eat meat. Eating consciously will be one of the struggles that  and define my life.We do not simply feed our bellies, and we do not simply modify our appetites in response to principles. We eat to satisfy primitive cravings, to forge and express ourselves, to realise community. We eat with our mouths and stomachs, but also with our minds and hearts. All my different identities – father, son, American, New Yorker, progressive, Jew, writer, environmentalist, traveller, hedonist – are present when I eat, and so is my history. When I first chose to become vegetarian, as a nine-year-old, my motivation was simple: do not hurt animals. Over the years, my motivations changed – because the available information changed, but more importantly, because my life changed. As I imagine is the case for most people, ageing has proliferated my identities. Time softens ethical binaries and fosters a greater appreciation of what might be called the messiness of life.There is a place at which one’s personal business and the business of being one of seven billion earthlings intersect. And for perhaps the first moment in history, the expression “one’s time” makes little sense. Climate change is not a jigsaw puzzle on the coffee table, which can be returned to when the schedule allows and the feeling inspires. It is a house on fire. The longer we fail to take care of it, the harder it becomes to take care of, and because of positive feedback loops – white ice melting to dark water that absorbs more heat thawing permafrost releasing huge amounts of methane – we will very soon reach a tipping point of “runaway climate change”, when we will be unable to save ourselves, no matter how much effort we make.We do not have the luxury of living in our time. We cannot go about our lives as if they were only ours. In a way that was not true for our ancestors, the lives we live will create a future that cannot be undone. The word “crisis” derives from the Greek krisis, meaning “decision”.Future generations will almost certainly look back and wonder why on earth – why on Earth – did we choose our suicide? Perhaps we could plead that the decision wasn’t ours to make: as much as we cared, there was nothing we could do. We didn’t know enough at the time. Being mere iniduals, we didn’t have the means to enact consequential change. We didn’t run the oil companies. We weren’t making government policy. The ability to save ourselves, and save them, was not in our hands. But that would be a lie.Our attention has been fixed on fossil fuels, which has given us an incomplete picture of the planetary crisis and led us to feel that we are hurling rocks at a Goliath far out of reach. Even if they are not persuasive enough on their own to change our behaviour, facts can change our minds, and that’s where we need to begin. We know we have to do something, but “we have to do something” is usually an expression of incapacitation, or at least uncertainty. Without identifying the thing that we have to do, we cannot decide to do it.Climate change is a crisis that will always be simultaneously addressed together and faced alone. The four highest impact things an inidual can do to tackle the planetary crisis are: have fewer children live car-free avoid air travel and eat a plant-based diet. Most people are not in the process of deciding whether to have a baby. Few drivers can simply decide to stop using their cars. A sizable portion of air travel is unavoidable. But everyone will eat a meal relatively soon and can immediately participate in the reversal of climate change. Furthermore, of those four high-impact actions, only plant-based eating immediately addresses methane and nitrous oxide, the most urgently important greenhouse gases.No animal products for breakfast or lunch would come close to achieving that. It might not amount to precisely the reductions that are asked for, but it’s about right, and easy to remember.It would be both disingenuous and counterproductive to pretend that eating only plant-based foods before dinner won’t require some adjusting. But I bet that if most people think back over their favourite meals of the past few years – the meals that brought them the most culinary and social pleasure, that meant the most culturally or religiously – virtually all of them would be dinners.And we have to acknowledge that change is inevitable. We can choose to make changes, or we can be subject to other changes – mass migration of climate refugees, disease, armed conflict, a greatly diminished quality of life – but there is no future without change. The luxury of choosing which changes we prefer has an expiration date.Doing what needs to be done will involve invention (such as creating veggie burgers that are indistinguishable from beef burgers), and legislation (such as adjusting farm subsidies and holding animal agriculture responsible for its environmental destruction), and bottom-up advocacy (such as college students demanding their cafeterias do not serve animal products before dinner), and top-down advocacy (such as celebrities spreading the message that we cannot save the planet without changing how we eat).Emphasising inidual responsibility doesn’t need to distract from corporate and federal responsibility. We absolutely need structural change – we need a global shift away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy. We need to enforce something akin to a carbon tax, mandate environmental-impact labels for products, replace plastic with sustainable solutions and build walkable cities. We need to end subsidies to the factory farming industry, and hold it accountable for the environmental destruction it incurs. We need to ethically address the west’s relationship to the global south. We might even need a political revolution. These changes will require shifts that iniduals alone cannot realise. But putting aside the fact that collective revolutions are made up of iniduals, led by iniduals, and reinforced by thousands of inidual revolutions, we would have no chance of achieving our goal of limiting environmental destruction if iniduals don’t make the very inidual decision to live differently.Every time we say “crisis”, we are also saying “decision”. The word “decision” derives from the Latin decidere, which means “to cut off”. Every decision requires loss, not only of what we might have done otherwise but of the world to which our alternative action would have contributed. Often that loss feels too small to notice sometimes it feels too large to bear. Usually, we just don’t think about our decisions in those terms. We live in a culture of historically unprecedented acquisition. We are prompted to define ourselves by what we have: possessions, dollars, views and likes. But we are revealed by what we release.Climate change is the greatest crisis humankind has ever faced, and it is one that will always be simultaneously addressed together and faced alone. We cannot keep eating the kinds of meals we have known and also keep the planet we have known. We must either let some eating habits go or let the planet go. It is that straightforward, and that fraught.• We are the Weather by Jonathan Safran Foer is published on 10 October by Hamish Hamilton (£16.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

Two years ago, Philip Pullman met the challenge of returning to the world of His Dark Materials by going back in time. La Belle Sauvage, the first volume of his planned trilogy The Book of Dust, was a prequel, telling how, as a baby, Lyra Belacqua was saved from the deadly agents of the Magisterium, the authoritarian church that is always seeking to extend its powers. Her rescuer was the heroic but thoroughly human Malcolm, an 11-year-old living with his parents in a pub on the river outside Oxford. Now, in The Secret Commonwealth, the second volume of The Book of Dust, Pullman does something riskier: he jumps forward 20 years – a decade on from the memorably sad, satisfyingly inevitable ending of The Amber Spyglass – to give us the story of Lyra as a young adult.Now she is a student in that familiar-yet-strange Oxford of Pullman’s alternative world. (This book stays in that world and never crosses to our own.) She has become very intellectual and a little solemn and has fallen out with her daemon, Pantalaimon. But she cannot retreat into her books, as she soon realises that she remains a person of interest to the Magisterium. The book’s gripping opening chapter moves between sinister machinations among leaders of the church in Geneva, and a clumsy murder in night-time Oxford. The murder victim, Lyra discovers, is a botanist – mystical botanical lore is at the heart of this tale. He had recently returned from a research trip to Central Asia where, we strongly suspect, we will eventually be led.Everyone is older. Malcolm, whose help Lyra soon recruits, has grown into an eccentric young academic with a tendresse for Lyra, his former student, that is distinctly adult. Other characters from the earlier books return, a little time-worn, to assist our heroine. As she flees the deadly theocrats, there are plenty of the thrills you might recognise from His Dark Materials, yet this is a long way from that work. “Not suitable for younger readers,” warns the Waterstones website. There is graphic violence and an attempted gang rape. There is also some depiction of Lyra’s awakened sexuality, though Pullman makes her seek out the company of men to whom she is not attracted, so that she cannot be unfaithful to the absent Will, forever lost to his parallel world.Pullman seems to be writing for those who read the HDM novels as children, but are children no longer. Lyra herself is naggingly conscious of what she has lost from the earlier books. Asked an awkward question by a suspicious stranger, she fails to produce the fearless lies she would once have managed, and thinks to herself that “now she just lacked inventiveness, or energy, or chutzpah”. Pantalaimon tells her that she has become “cautious … anxious … pessimistic”. The two of them become literally as well as psychologically separated one plotline follows Lyra’s quest to recover her daemon, without whom she appears to others as “an appalling and uncanny figure” – and also, we discover, newly vulnerable.She has had her head turned by seductive books. Her daemon goes on a long journey to Wittenberg (the city of Martin Luther, where Hamlet went to university) to accuse the stern intellectual, Gottfried Brande, of stealing Lyra’s imagination from her. Brande has published a huge novel written in a prose purged of all figurative language, which proposes that daemons are illusions: it has become a vogue throughout Europe. Meanwhile Lyra journeys towards the east, while Malcolm separately tracks her. There is always plenty of dizzying travel in Pullman’s fiction, here more breathless than ever. Lyra meets an alchemist in Prague, witnesses an assassination in Constantinople, narrowly avoids being killed in Smyrna.A paranoid gent at a central European railway station or a wizened old lady in a Levantine port only has to mention a distant destination for Lyra or Malcolm to hurtle off towards it. We know that the answers to the book’s various teasing puzzles must lie in that fabled botanical research station (but perhaps beyond the bounds of this particular volume). Pullman’s narrative method is to ide our attentions not only between Lyra, Malcolm and Pan, but also between them and the leading operatives of the Magisterium, scheming and debating about how to perpetuate their chilly faith. We keep going back to the Maison Juste in Geneva, the world centre for “the examination of heresy and heretics”. Here we get a good deal of ecclesiastical power politics, with the deliciously Machiavellian Marcel Delamere eliminating rivals and concentrating power in his own hands. The satire of religious flummery is even more explicit and withering than in the original trilogy. Indeed, Pullman is more tempted to draw parallels with our world’s discontents than he has ever been. Our own refugee crises and confrontations with Islamic fundamentalism (here “the brotherhood of the holy purpose”) have their ready analogies in his fictional universe. Lyra is pitted against not only the agents of theocracy but also a ruthless multinational chemical company.His main target here, however, is as much intolerant rationality as intolerant theism – the life-denying Reason that William Blake, his literary guide, deplored and mocked. The Magisterium has recruited a clever nihilistic philosopher, Simon Talbot. He is their “useful idiot”. Lyra so relishes intellectual dispute, “searching out the weaknesses in someone else’s arguments, and cracking them open with a flourish”, that she has fallen under his sway. Blake would certainly have concurred with Pullman’s satire on showily rationalistic philosophy, a scepticism so complete that it deadens the soul.Thus, the importance of “the secret commonwealth”, which is the world beyond rationality. Lyra begins to realise that it is what she has left behind in her childhood (and in the original His Dark Materials trilogy). “It was quite invisible to everyday vision … it was seen by the imagination, whatever that was, and not by logic.” As one of the many advisers she meets tells her, its affairs sometimes “leak through into the visible world”. Lyra must find her daemon again to put herself back in touch with it, to rediscover Blakean innocence.Pullman has successfully turned his heroine into an adult by making her remember herself as a child, which also means remembering the earlier books that we all loved. But there is a downside. Previously, Lyra’s experiences and Pullman’s ideas were separate. As a child, she did not know what her story meant. Now she can ruminate in tune with the author’s purposes. “Has reason ever created a poem, or a symphony, or a painting? If rationality can’t see things like the secret commonwealth, it’s because rationality’s vision is limited … We need to imagine as well as measure …” This is Lyra thinking, but it is also rather too clearly Pullman speaking to us.Imagination, the mysterious power celebrated by the Romantic poets, is the holy spirit of this book. It opens with a contrarian epigraph from Blake: “Everything possible to be believ’d is an image of the truth.” This declaration sounds permissive (you can believe whatever you like) but is in fact stern (you should listen harder to the logic of your instinctual beliefs). It is the law of fiction that Pullman obeys. He has created a fantasy world, made yet more satisfying in this new volume and pursued with his own special rigour and stylistic elegance.

And all thanks to local businesses stepping in to help out.“Mr Cook has got to marry his bride,” said Vallantis Lapis, the local town hall president, who officiated the ceremony under bright blue skies in the gardens of a hotel overlooking the sea. “They’re such a lovely couple,” he told the . “We were always going to do our best to make this happen.”The big day was far from certain even 48 hours before the east Midlands pair exchanged vows. They flew into Rhodes with their two young daughters, Lucy and Alice, barely a week before the UK’s oldest travel firm went into liquidation.Its collapse meant that half of the couple’s guests, including the 29-year-old groom’s best man, were caught up in the travel chaos and unable to reach the island. Within hours of the bankruptcy being announced, it had become apparent that Cook, an employee of Rolls-Royce, was going to struggle to marry at all. The £10,000 spent on the trip appeared to have been blown.“Thomas Cook promised us a surprise on our wedding because of my name, but this was not the surprise we were expecting,” he told the news site Nottinghamshire Live. “I am just devastated. We have got 30-plus friends and family coming out, half are stuck at home in limbo … I have been planning this for two years and it has all gone to pot. We have paid for everything. It is shattering.”Binch, 27, a beautician, bemoaned that instead of looking forward to the special day “we are sat here stressed out”.Like thousands of others stranded in Greece following the operator’s fall, they had also been informed they could be airlifted out of the country by the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority “any time”.At that point the Lindos Princess hotel weighed in, agreeing to foot part of the bill, including the flowers and champagne that Thomas Cook had originally pledged to lay on.“We were told by the proprietor: ‘Do what you can, make it work,’” said Giorgos Bakas, the four-star establishment’s general manager, confessing that staff, at first, couldn’t believe the groom’s name. “When we realised it wasn’t a mistake and saw how upset the couple were, we rallied.”Like most resorts in Rhodes, Lindos is becoming increasingly popular among Britons who prefer to tie the knot abroad. A civil ceremony on the island will set couples back just €70 in registry office fees.“We do well over 300 weddings a year,” enthused Lapis, who ran a local cafe before being elected to the post recently. “Every ceremony is special but Mr Cook’s has been doubly so today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcf8591a163ad4a14fdcebae5d0eb1d1044608cf/328_57_3466_2081/master/3466.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90620ec2170a74e248b4250e69249939","title":"thomas cook booking holidays travel hotels flights","story":"What the travel firm’s collapse should teach anyone planning packages, flights or hotelsIn the early hours of Monday morning, with most of its fleet of planes on the ground, the rug was pulled from under Thomas Cook, in the biggest failure of a travel firm in British history. Tens of thousands of holidaymakers have been airlifted home, many after exhausting queues in airports, and with a million more are seeking refunds on future bookings. So what does the debacle tell us about protecting ourselves when making bookings in future?If you’ve just spent 24 hours at Dalaman airport waiting to board a rescheduled flight home, or you were forced out of your hotel by irate owners, you might disagree. But the Atol (Air Travel Organiser’s Licence) scheme has mostly come to the aid of up to 600,000 holidaymakers who had Thomas Cook bookings for future trips, or were already abroad. Set up in 1973 after several high profile travel firms collapsed leaving people stranded in Spain, a £2.50 Atol levy is applied to each holiday booking.As the name suggests Atol covers flight-based trips, and also most cruise packages. It has been extended to those booking flights and hotels together with the likes of Expedia and Lastminute. So a weekend away in Rome can be covered in the same way as a package holiday to Turkey but only if you book both from the same travel firm.Brexit“There is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many UK customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer,” said the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, in May. But it cannot be the whole story - arch-rival Tui has coped because its finances are healthier.\u0026nbspWeatherThe summer heatwave of 2018 encouraged would-be holidaymakers to stay at home, undermining prices in the “lates” market where operators try to clear unsold holidays. There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.CompetitionA pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year.\u0026nbspBanks and debtThe tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a\u0026nbsp huge pile of debt for the past decade – £1.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service.\u0026nbspBad managementThomas Cook’s borrowings were too high. The moral of the tale is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively. If your balance sheet is fragile, you are at the mercy of events in an industry where most of the cash arrives in the summer and then flows out in the winter.Thomas Cook won’t be the last travel firm to fail, so check your travel agentwebsite is Atol registered before handing over card details – and be aware Atol is only offered by UK based travel firms.Beware how many foreign travel websites will give the impression they are based in the UK when they are not. Firms have to publish their Atol number – and if you unsure you can check its validity on the Civil Aviation Authority website. When you make an Atol protected booking you will receive an Atol certificate which lists which parts of the trip that are financially protected. If you don’t get a certificate, you don’t have the protection. For that weekend in Rome, check what you are booking is Atol covered, as the way in which it is booked is crucial as to whether you have cover or not. You have similar but different cover if your package starts with a train or coach trip. It’s the same for UK cruises.While Atol was designed to cover flight-based trips, the Package Travel regulations apply to all other holiday travel packages booked if they are booked through Abta-registered travel agentswebsites. If you book a rail or coach trip, or a cruise that starts in the UK and includes hotel accommodation thrown in, it is the Abta agent scheme that will refund you if the travel firm collapses, or get you home if required. It’s the same story if your cruise starts at a UK port. Some Thomas Cook customers who had used its travel agents to book trips with other tour operators will have had their bookings honoured because they were covered by Abta, Abta told us this week.If you book a flight using the Ryanair, or rival carrier’s website, and a hotel, or villa on Booking or Airbnb – there is no Atol protection. As a result the advice is always to pay using a credit rather than debit card because it allows you to hold the card company liable in the event the airline folds before you travel, provided the ticket cost more than £100.While it is unlikely Ryanair will collapse, it is only a matter of time before another airline folds. There were plenty of people who booked flight-only deals with Thomas Cook who are now making section 75 claims to their card providers.For bookings costing less than £100, or if you paid by debit card, you may be able to claim money back from your card provider through the chargeback scheme. The chargeback process isn’t a legal requirement, but has become an industry standard. Some Thomas Cook customers have had flight-only charges refunded via chargebacks.You may buy a flight from Ryanair and later add a hotel on its much-promoted Ryanair Rooms site, but that does not automatically constitute a package deal. Basically to benefit from EU “linked travel arrangement” protection you must purchase both flight and hotel from the same company within the same 24 hours. Ryanair told us its passengers are protected under the Irish package travel directive, which is equivalent to Atol. On lastminute if you buy flight and hotel in one go, paid together, you get Atol protection. In truth, the rules are a mess for consumers to navigate, through.It’s known as scheduled airline failure (SAF) in the trade, or in the better travel policies supplier failure. The aim of the cover is to step in if an airline’s collapse leaves you stranded abroad or unable to depart.Arguably, if you always buy flights with a credit card, you don’t need it as the card provider is liable. But SAF would cover the buying of more expensive replacement flights, which would allow the rest of the trip to carry on. It will also pay out if you bought the flights without a credit card.The problem is that many travel policies, particularly those at the cheaper end of the spectrumones, don’t provide this cover as standard. According to Defaqto, just over half of the 1,135 annual travel policies listed SAF cover of between £100-£15,000. The average amount of cover offered under a SAF policy is £2,500.Economycover’s Premier Plus annual family multitrip policy (Europe only) costs £51.20 a year, and includes £8,000 cancellation cover and £5,000 SAF cover. Multitrip has a similar policy costing £36 a year with £3,000 cancellation and £1,500 SAF.You have to feel for the Cambridgeshire family from Cambridgeshire who spent two years saving up more than £800 for Thomas Cook vouchers to pay for their dream trip to Euro Disney. Lianne Jones had even bought some more vouchers at her local Thomas Cook travel agent a week before its collapse, only to be told they are now worthless. Retail vouchers of any kind are just not worth the risk anymore. Too many consumers have lost out in this way.Thomas Cook’s collapse may have been all over the , and most news broadcasts, but that didn’t stop several passengers turning up at Gatwick on Monday expecting to board a grounded Thomas Cook flight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6324b33cc9c4f49a887bf071e2c2296cf3d14016/0_305_4914_2948/master/4914.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b887f7958fc576293e6122e9bb782572","title":"tories dominic cummings people v parliament election","story":"Drawn increasingly into darkness and rage, the UK government functions as a promotional tie-in for the controversial Joker movie. Out next week, kids. Think of it as a Tory conference chaser. For now, it’s great to see everyone’s favourite political incel break cover, as Dominic Cummings makes a series of appearances among the chaos to announce: “We are enjoying this.” Such a self-styled antihero. He used to think what happened to his Brexit was a tragedy, but now he knows it’s a comedy.The latest clip ends with Cummings blowing a kiss to the news cameras, a reminder that politics allows some people to play out a wishful version of themselves that would be laughed out of town anywhere normal. In any sane arena, Dominic is the answer to the inquiry: “What would happen if you shaved Quentin Tarantino’s head but kept everything else much the same?”It is thanks to Cummings that the Palace of Westminster this week resembled a sort of meth-addled Hogwarts, and yet Conservative MPs cling to him even though they know he hates them. More on these imbecile henchmen later. Only a political incel could rage in entitlement against “Project Fear”, yet orchestrate “senior allies of Boris Johnson” – including a cabinet minister – to inform Friday’s Times that there would be a “violent, popular uprising” if they don’t do what he wants. Thank you, Anonymous Secretary of State, for treating public life like an angry online forum. Save it for your 10-page manifesto you mail to the newsrooms.Of course, the thing about incels (metaphorical and otherwise) is that while a huge part of their self-mythology is claiming they represent the unheard, the reality is that people really listen to their shit. Consider the case of the man accused of driving a van into pedestrians in Toronto last year, killing 10 people, who warned in a police video (released on Friday) that he’d start an incel uprising with it all. Nine days – nine days! – after that mass murder, I read an extremely serious column in the New York Times that used the event to discuss the “redistribution of sex”. As its author put it: “Sometimes the extremists and radicals and weirdos see the world more clearly than the respectable and moderate and sane.”Well, it was an admiring “wow” from me. Men’s rights is wild. These guys really get stuff done. Women have been fannying about for decades asking peacefully for their rights, and we still can’t be in charge of our own bodies. Ten people get killed, and before the fortnight’s out there’s a chinstroker in the world’s leading liberal newspaper wondering how we can address the needs and concerns of the suspect.Like Cummings, the “big thinkers” who pander to these instincts are never going to be the ones getting hurt. Just as the guy who wrote that New York Times op-ed truly has my blessing to go and wank off whatever inadequates he likes as a public service to stop male terrorism or something, I suspect he thinks it’s a job for ladies. Not his problem. He’s thunked the thinkpiece, and it’s up to the patsies to enact it.There is so much of this to Cummings’ “people vs parliament” brand of politics, but the patsies – the Tory MPs – are yet to catch on. While most women could read that New York Times column and work out what it basically meant for them, a lot of Conservative MPs are dutifully spouting Cummings’ lines, but don’t yet seem to have worked out where they leave them.But listen, Tory mooks – I’m here to help. While you’re getting a tiki torch and standing a post, let me tell you what a “people vs parliament” election ultimately means for you. First, if you whip up an angry mob, why do you assume they won’t end up angry with you? Do you think the mob is going to come upon an MP and go, “Wait, wait – this is so-and-so. He voted for Meaningful Votes 2 and 3, so we should, you know, definitely not put our pitchforks up his arse”? Eventually, you’re going to get a pitchfork up your arse either way.To adapt that phrase of the alt-right to whom you tack closer every day: mobs don’t care about your feelings. If I had to come up with an adjective to help you understand mobs, it would probably be mob-like. Very mobby. Mobtastic. If you go to the country in a people v parliament election, you may indeed get elected and be part of a triumphant Tory majority. But when you have been elected, and when you’ve “got Brexit done” – which is to say, when you’ve either taken the UK off the no-deal cliff, or opened up the next however many painful years of trade negotiations fuckery-pokery, which is never going to solve the problems it is magically supposed to – you, then, are “parliament”.The even angrier people are then versus YOU. That’s when they come for you, because you asked them to. You invited them in. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard this line “the revolution devours its children”? That’s you, babe. Second, I know you’ve already only read about one war, but bad news: it’s the wrong war. You need the first world war, not the second. By way of a crash course of what Dom’s got planned for you, take the line in Blackadder, where the general brays to the guys he’s sending over the top: “We’ll be right behind you!” and Blackadder mutters: “About 35 miles behind you.” You’re the cannon fodder, you’re the Twenty Minuters. But, hey – enjoy it out there.Third, as is blindingly obvious to everyone else, Cummings is one of those masterminds who hates his henchmen. He hates the Conservative party. He believes he’s surrounded by idiots. Again: that’s you, babe.What’s amazing, given he’s written all of this stuff down, and at length, is the selective deafness of the Tories going along with it. They hear the stuff Dom is saying about things being swept away. But they don’t hear the bits that will eventually mean them.Consider the irony of the European Research Group currently obeying a man who described them as a “narcissist-delusional subset”, adding: “You should be treated like a metastasising tumour and excised from the UK body politic.” It’s not a hugely opaque statement.More moderate Conservatives should realise where they’re travelling with this stuff. Some people just want to watch your bit of the world burn. You bow to them at your peril – and ours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/845b6eb91145b61011aae30c56941e01404c98c0/0_193_4782_2868/master/4782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03165b53dcf910173d03db6801956162","title":"wales nationalism brexit welsh language","story":"There’s a shift towards a more civic, inclusive ideal, which envisages Wales as an independent nation within a larger federal EUThe last time I visited family in north Wales, I was heartened to see the words “Cofiwch Dryweryn” (“Remember Tryweryn”) emblazoned on several walls. I had read about how the patriotic slogan was popping up, meme-like, all over the country, but I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes. Call me a misty-eyed Welsh nationalist if you like, but I felt quite emotional. Ever since I was a little girl and my father pulled over the car to show me where a village once stood, I had known the story of Capel Celyn, the community flooded in 1965 to create a reservoir for Liverpool in the Tryweryn valley, and how it became a nationalist cause.The repeated vandalisation of the original graffiti, which the poet Meic Stephens painted in the 1960s and which has now gained charity protection, has led to a kind of viral graffiti campaign, with Cofiwch Dryweryn appearing on walls and slag heaps, alongside roads and near beaches, and even on the side of mountains. It feels like the most significant display of Welsh pride that I have seen in my lifetime.It is a valid point, but it usually ignores the fact that all the predominantly Welsh-speaking areas voted to remain. It doesn’t surprise me that those who believe their language and culture have been historically oppressed by English politicians would feel they have more in common with, and are more protected by, the EU27 countries (bear in mind that this was before the Catalan crisis). And the potential impact of inward-migration of people from England into Welsh communities on voter demographics had scarcely been covered until research by the geographer Danny Dorling, unveiled last week, suggested what many of us had long suspected: that older English settlers may have swayed the vote in favour of Brexit.Modern Welsh nationalism is no longer only a question of language, though for those of us who speak Welsh it will always be a part of the conversation. Plaid Cymru’s shift towards a more civic, inclusive form of nationalism, which like the SNP envisages Wales as an independent nation within a larger federal EU, can claim to represent anyone living in Wales – not just those who speak Welsh. At the Merthyr rally, there was more proof that the independence movement has gone mainstream: there were speeches from the former Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall and the former rugby player Eddie Butler. Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, points out that the conversation has now moved beyond Plaid to other political parties – and to Labour in particular.With its stronger linguistic dimension, Welsh nationalism will always be different to Scottish nationalism. As the Scottish academic Tom Nairn wrote, the latter was more of a “politically oriented separatism … concerned with problems of state and power, and frequently indifferent to the themes of race and cultural ancestry”. But it seems the IndyWales movement is keenly watching Scotland, and a shift towards political nationalism may emerge (it is also worth noting that the pressure group Yes Cymru is deliberately non-party political to broaden appeal). When the British state is floundering, the idea of self-determination – within a larger, protective European framework – has powerful appeal.Like their Scottish counterparts, Welsh independence campaigners are now rejecting traditional nationalism. That’s not to say the language is no longer important – to speakers such as me, it is part of who we are – but that campaigners have perhaps realised that the mythology of “the overpowering past that nationalism drools over”, to quote Nairn, is less persuasive to voters than the prospect of a fairer society with more devolved powers. • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a  columnist and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc233eef393186bfceb1dd0fa3e654b767d02058/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f852737e3a92a8fe6b28b99857aad20","title":"greta thunberg justin trudeau meeting climate strikes","story":"Teen has private meeting with Canadian prime minister, who later says he ‘agrees with her completely’The teen activist Greta Thunberg has urged Justin Trudeau and other world leaders to do more for the environment as she led half a million protesters in Montreal as part of a global wave of “climate strikes.”The 16-year-old Swede met privately with the Canadian prime minister but later told a news conference with local indigenous leaders that he was “not doing enough” to curb greenhouse gases responsible for global warming.“My message to all the politicians around the world is the same. Just listen and act on the current best available science,” she said.Thunberg generated headlines around the world earlier this week with her viral so-called “How Dare You?” speech at the UN climate summit, accusing world leaders of betraying her generation.The teen has inspired millions of youths, drawn to her cause by her passion and a mature, committed rhetorical style that belies her young age.She has also drawn mockery from some, including Donald Trump, who tweeted sarcastically that “she seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future”.Without naming the US president, Thunberg said she didn’t “understand why grown-ups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead”.“We’ve become too loud for people to handle so people want to silence us … We should also take that as a compliment.” Trudeau and other Canadian party leaders took a breather from a tight election campaign to join Thunberg at the Montreal rally – along with around 500,000 protesters, according to organizers.Walking with his wife and children, Trudeau mingled with a boisterous crowd that brandished placards reading “Respect Mother Earth” and “Make America Greta Again” – a riff on a campaign slogan popularized by Trump, a noted climate change skeptic.One man was tackled by security when he appeared to lunge at the prime minister, while 13-year-old Annabelle Vellend broke out in tears when she spotted Thunberg, telling AFP: “I really believe in Greta’s movement.”“She is doing amazing things and it’s great that she’s able to press politicians to act on climate change, during an election,” she said.In his first term, Trudeau cast himself as a champion in the fight against global warming, but his green image was tarnished by his nationalization of an oil pipeline to salvage the construction project after years of delay.The prime minister said after meeting Thunberg and pledging to fund the planting of 2bn trees: “I agree with her entirely. We need to do more.”Earlier this week, the Liberal leader vowed that Canada would reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, joining 66 other countries that have already signed on to the pledge.Last Friday, more than 4 million youths – and adults – rallied in “climate strikes” around the world.Turnout at events a week on was smaller, but still vocal. In Italy, hundreds of thousands of young people took to the streets while an estimated 40,000 protested outside New Zealand’s parliament.In Canada, events also attracted huge crowds in the capital, Ottawa in Toronto and in several other cities.In the heart of the giant Montreal march, made up mostly of children and a few adults, Alexanne Lessard stood out in her tree costume.“I’m here for our future, to show our government that we the majority want to do something and that they can take big steps that will an impact,” she said.Daphnee Choquette said she came out for her baby girl, whom she carried with her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e322e4b5adbc7d2b49d99f9c1657cd839e041636/0_183_5476_3286/master/5476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8a1aaa78719e92afd808b78c617fc46","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"An award-winning seal in a seaweed garden, a hippo in drought-hit Botswana and a sable"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a302919db9d43fd7ff805cf6050bedbd86373fe/90_266_5756_3454/master/5756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efd54c33118b48f883da1bdff6349b7b","title":"he is a psychopath has the 2019 joker gone too far","story":"Todd Phillips’s take has been mired in controversy, but it’s not the first time the character has reflected society“Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?” Joaquin Phoenix’s proto-Joker Arthur Fleck asks his psychologist in the new Joker movie. The real answer is both. Fleck is beset with a host of personal issues, but the world “out there” is a powder keg of lawlessness, inequality, corruption, cuts and all-round despair. Joker’s story is set around the early 1980s, but it consciously chimes with our own increasingly crazy present. “These are tough times,” the psychologist acknowledges. She might as well turn and wink to the camera.It’s no surprise that 2019’s Joker – while set to be a triumph, critically and commercially – has raised concerns over its narrative. An early, leaked version of the script, plus the portrayal of Phoenix’s character as a sad young man beset by a host of personal issues (mental health problems, past trauma, failing comedy career, loneliness) has led to the film being aligned with so-called “incel” culture (involuntarily celibate men who are angry and misogynistic).Early reviewers have expressed concern over what messages the movie might be transmitting, and what actions it might inspire. “In America, there’s a mass shooting or attempted act of violence by a guy like Arthur practically every other week,” wrote Time’s Stephanie Zacharek. Concerned by the part Fleck’s unrequited love for his neighbour (Zazie Beetz) plays in his violent trajectory, she added “he could easily be adopted as the patron saint of incels”. The ’s Robbie Collin meanwhile wrote: “Make no mistake, this is a film that is going stir up trouble,” admitting he partly felt the film “should be locked in a strongbox then dropped in the ocean and never released”. In a later interview, the  asked Phoenix if he was “worried that this film might perversely end up inspiring exactly the kind of people it’s about, with potentially tragic results?” Phoenix reportedly got up and walked out.Joker is not the first comic-book movie to sympathise with the bad guy, but it is the first to do it so one-sidedly. Superhero movies traditionally reassure us that good ultimately triumphs over evil, but Joker heads in the opposite direction. Fleck starts out as a decent but troubled soul. An aspiring standup comedian, he believes his mission is to bring laughter to the world, until life disabuses him of that notion. (Career advice: if you’re a clown entertaining a children’s hospital ward, don’t bring your gun to work.) Snip away the references to Gotham City and the Wayne family, and Joker is barely a comic-book movie at all, more a grim character study of snowballing defeat and humiliation, with no silver lining or caped crusader on the horizon. As the film-makers readily admit, and the casting of Robert DeNiro betrays, Joker follows in the footsteps of Martin Scorsese’s triumphantly bleak 1970s80s movies Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. But as critic David Ehrlich wrote in his Joker review: “There’s a fundamental difference between telling a story like this in the form of a dingy, misanthropic art film like Taxi Driver and telling it in the universal language of a superhero movie that’s going to open in multiplexes the world over. In this context, that story can’t help but feel aspirational.”As much as “doing something Marvel can’t do”, the suggestion is that Joker does something superhero movies shouldn’t do. Perhaps the concern is down to the nature of the Joker himself. It is hard to imagine this kind of story being made with any other comic-book character. The Joker is easily the most recognisable and popular villain in the game, and the most complex. And the most entertaining.“Every generation gets its own Joker,” says professor Ben Saunders, founder of the comic-book studies minor at the University of Oregon, who has written extensively on superheroes. “Every decade of the past 80 years has had its own version.” He suggests the character’s evolution is the result of a “complex, transmedia feedback loop” between the Joker’s various media portrayals, in comics, TV, animation, film and even video games. “The Joker is actually a series of Jokers – and talented creators are free to play with different elements in producing any new version.” Over his many screen portrayals, the Joker character has been on a steady journey from two-dimensions into three. Cesar Romero’s version in the 1960s Batman TV series captured the character’s trickster sensibility, but he was arguably no deeper than a playing card, reflecting both the tone of the Batman comic books at the time and the half-hour children’s show format, which was all screen superheroes then merited.The prankster aspect was still there in Tim Burton’s supposedly “darker” 1989 Batman. Despite coming into being in the era of “graphic novels” such as The Killing Joke and Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, which explored the characters on deeper levels, Burton’s Batman never pretended to be anything more than a live-action cartoon. In the presence of Michael Keaton’s rather stiff Bruce Wayne, and the absence of a compelling plot, Burton wisely allowed Jack Nicholson to steal the show. With its over-the-top design, retro stylings and Prince soundtrack (plus a fairly uncritical view of mega-capitalism), you could say Burton’s Batman was a very 1980s iteration.The success of Burton’s Batman set the tone for some woeful sequels, but we would have to wait till Christopher Nolan’s reign for the properly “dark” Dark Knight promised by Miller and Moore, where Heath Ledger’s unforgettable Joker interpretation is often held to be the conclusion of that journey towards three-dimensional characterisation (Jared Leto tried a little too hard to out-Ledger Ledger in Suicide Squad).How has the role endured? One distinguishing factor that is easily overlooked, points out Travis Langley, a psychology professor who has put many a pop-culture icon including the Joker on the couch, is that Batman has no actual superpowers. “Because Batman is defined by his personality, his enemies have to be as well. No other superhero has such a rich, well-known gallery of enemies, and the Joker is king of them all.” As such, Joker and Batman’s battleground has always been more psychological than physical, which is why Phillips’s serious, straight Joker story fits in so seamlessly. Batman stories are as much about madness and sanity as good and evil what other superhero world features the local mental asylum as a key location? But Langley hesitates to diagnose the Joker. “His behaviour does not neatly fit into any condition. The Joker is clearly a psychopath. He has no conscience. He has no empathy for anybody. He’s this agent of chaos and you’re just not sure, does he really know what he’s doing or not?”The Joker’s real superpower is messing with other people’s heads: Batman’s, his henchmen, his adversaries, his lover Harley Quinn, Commissioner Gordon (in Alan Moore’s The Killing Joke), Harvey Dent (in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight), the people of Gotham (in Tim Burton’s Batman), for example). In this light, it seems Joker the movie is being treated as another dastardly scheme to incite madness in the general populace.So should we be worried about the Joker’s real-world potential for inciting chaos? We have been here many times before, not least with Joker’s inspiration: Taxi Driver, and its part in the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan in 1982. Shooter John Hinckley Jr was obsessed with the movie. He watched it at least 15 times. He began to model himself on DeNiro’s Travis Bickle, who plots a political assassination and becomes infatuated with a teenage prostitute, played by Jodie Foster. Hinckley dressed like Bickle, collected firearms like him, kept a diary like him, even drank peach brandy like him. And he developed a real-life obsession with Foster, stalking her and writing to her that he had shot Reagan to impress her.At Hinckley’s trial, the defence closed with a screening of Taxi Driver. One of his defence experts stated that Hinckley felt “like he was acting out a movie script”. He was found not guilty of Reagan’s attempted murder on grounds of insanity. It is often a chicken-and-egg situation, or perhaps a transmedia feedback loop. Taxi Driver was itself informed by the attempted assassination of presidential candidate George Wallace, by Arthur Bremer, in 1972. Bremer was another disturbed, lonely young man, obsessed with firearms and pornography, recently dumped by his 16-year-old girlfriend. Taxi Driver’s writer, Paul Schrader, acknowledged Bremer as an inspiration for Bickle, but said that he based the character as much on himself as anyone.Often it is more stylised, youth-friendly violent movies that strike the “dangerous” chord. A Clockwork Orange, American Psycho, and Natural Born Killers, for example, all of which were implicated in copycat attacks. The latter has a whole Wikipedia page of “copycat crimes”, including the Columbine High School massacre. The media is now hard-wired to make links between movie and real-life violence, even when they’re not there. Bringing the issue closer to home was the 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado, which killed 12 people and injured 70. It happened during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises. Early reports claimed witnesses had heard the shooter shouting words to the effect of: “I am the Joker”. He had dyed hair, and “Batman paraphernalia” was found in his apartment, which led many to leap to the conclusion that this was another case of movie-inspired violence. But the theory later fell apart: the shooter was not a Batman or Joker fan his hair was dyed red, not green the Batman mask in his apartment was likely purchased after he’d chosen which movie to attack. According to the Aurora trial prosecutor, the shooting could just as easily have happened during a showing of The Avengers or Jurassic World: “It had nothing to do, that we can find, with Batman.” In the past week, however, relatives of those killed at the screening have written a letter to Warners to express concerns about the film (“It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero” was their response).Ironically, media sensationalism – a very 2019 theme – is very much core to Todd Phillips’s Joker. DeNiro’s TV chatshow host is a significant, if inadvertent, catalyst for Fleck’s transformation. Meanwhile, the Gotham press eagerly spins Fleck’s first killings into a city-wide “kill the rich” class war. In one telling moment, Fleck spots an artist’s impression of a manically smiling “killer clown” on the front page of a newspaper. He adjusts his own smile to match it. Rather than transmitting the “craziness”, Joker is really interested in examining its causes, in the here and now as much as some alternative comic-book past. That necessarily entails empathising with its subject, and identifying lack of empathy as one of those causes. Sexual frustration might be another, but for all the buzz about incels, it is not the overriding theme. There is no simple explanation it is more about an accumulation of factors, internal and external, that might drive a person, or a society, over the edge.If that feels a little too dangerous right now, maybe it’s a sign of how close to the edge we are.Joker is in cinemas from Friday 4 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d8880c854c33be15ef59c5664a1ddd073096343/0_181_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=953d9da2bd91b0b23690d3b29e77f241","title":"the irishman review scorsese netflix de niro","story":"Robert De Niro is a – slightly dead-eyed – whippersnapper once more in this exquisitely made, decades-ning passion project bankrolled by NetflixFor an auteur whose work has often been bridled by commercially-minded studio executives, Netflix offers something close to total creative control, a seductive if dangerous proposition. It’s how the streaming behemoth lured everyone from Alfonso Cuarón to Steven Soderbergh to the Coen brothers and it’s partly how ultimate get Martin Scorsese was gotten. Originally set at Paramount, his ambitious, decades-ning, fact-based crime drama The Irishman was deemed too financially excessive, its budget spinning out to more than $150m. But with the ability to not only bankroll but to remove any fears of box office failure, Netflix welcomed Scorsese with open arms and a gaping chequebook.The result, boasting a budget usually reserved for a film with a colon in its title and a staggering 209-minute runtime, is a gamble nonetheless given that unquestionable talents have unquestionably struggled with the type of indulgent free rein streaming platforms tend to offer. There’s also the small matter of why the production costs were so high, mainly down to a desire from Scorsese to digitally de-age his primary cast members, a controversial practice that has yet to be perfected. But The Irishman, serving as this year’s splashy opening night premiere of the New York film festival, is not only a successful film on its own terms but a successful example of how this brave new industry shift can benefit those who use great power with great responsibility. Because, quite simply, the film as it is would never have survived the modern studio system without streaming assistance.Scorsese has referred to it as “a costly experiment” although at its core, it’s familiar, even safe, territory for him. It has been a passion project of his since 2007 and sees him reunited with the Goodfellas and Casino pairing of Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. De Niro is Frank Sheeran, a second world war veteran whose ensuing career as a truck driver belied his cold-blooded ability to kill with little remorse. But he soon found his way into a life of crime, first with a bit of light theft and ultimately as an efficient killer, working for mob boss Russell Bufalino (Pesci). The two became close and led Sheeran to also work alongside Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), whose corrupt tactics as a labor union leader made him a target to both the authorities and the criminal underworld.Scorsese and screenwriter Steven Zaillian decide to tell Sheeran’s story at three different ages and with the help of similar instayouth tech we have seen in everything from American Horror Story to Avengers: Endgame. But within the confines of a more naturalistic setting, there’s something undeniably jarring about its use, both in how at times it really works and how at times, it really doesn’t. The film’s biggest, creepiest problem lies behind De Niro’s fortysomething eyes – or rather the film’s biggest, creepiest problem is that nothing lies behind them. Understandably the hardest physical feature to digitise, De Niro’s gaze is stuck with this faintly nightmarish, Polar Express-esque vacancy and while it distracts at first, the surrounding film is so vastly impressive that I found myself otherwise immersed.It’s not often that any director is afforded such a luxurious budget outside of franchise fare. This year, it has miraculously happened twice but while Quentin Tarantino’s overhyped and undercooked Once Upon a Time in Hollywood only teased at what a recreation of late 60s Los Angeles might look like with $90m to spare, Scorsese takes us far deeper. As one might expect from a director of such loving precision, The Irishman is exquisitely made, every detail carefully considered, every location perfectly picked and with such a gargantuan budget at hand, it feels utterly transporting, a film to be savoured on a big, crisp screen rather than half-watched on a smartphone. De-ageing quibbles aside, the craftsmanship contained here is flawless and my main reservation about its Netflix availability is that not enough people will get to appreciate the delicacy of Scorsese and his team’s work in theatres.But regardless of how one chooses to consume the film, the performances will soar nonetheless. De Niro’s well-documented decline, from Oscar-winning lightning bolt to mostly hapless hired hand, has allowed many to lose sight of his abilities and to lose hope that he might reconnect with his former glorious self. It’s obviously fitting that a reunion with his longtime collaborator would do the trick and it’s a joy to see him cruising at the top of his game again, curbing his parodied excesses and effortlessly steering the film through decades. Pacino has suffered a similar crash, wasting himself in ill-fitting dirge, and while he does fall into some of his scenery-chewing old tricks here, it’s the best we have seen from him in years.The film’s ace is a quietly electrifying Pesci, in his first role since 2010, an astounding reminder of his big screen presence with a character so dramatically distant from his previous Scorsese incarnations. He’s rational and professional, much like the film’s plot, which eschews the brash debauchery of Goodfellas or Casino for something far more grounded. There’s humour, plenty of it, but rather than watching men commit crimes to pay for extravagant luxuries, we see them do it for their family’s survival, or at least that’s how they might justify it.And it’s in this introspection where the film gets really interesting. When a director returns to a genre they’re most associated with, it can often feel like a greatest hits montage. For much of its duration, The Irishman covers familiar ground but is slickly entertaining, if a little repetitive in the third hour. In the last 30 minutes, as the pace slows and the quips subside and the violence quells, we are suddenly made aware of the ultimate price of this lifestyle and of the crushing savagery of old age. It’s a finale of stifling bleakness, of the pathetic emptiness of crime and of men who mistake their priorities in life, the discovery arriving all too late. There’s an almost meta-maturity, as if Scorsese is also looking back on his own career, the film leaving us with a haunting reminder not to glamorise violent men and the wreckage they leave behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/282cad040fb6d783568f16a85e201f0ee91f9100/0_49_2958_1775/master/2958.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47decb3399feba431852008cb31b4e39","title":"fish skin crackling recipe waste not tom hunt","story":"Many chefs would agree that it’s the skin that really crowns a well-cooked piece of fish. If you must take it off it, rather than letting it go to waste, turn it into a crunchy snack insteadIn the summer of 2003, my partner and I moved down to St Ives in our vintage camper van after I landed a job at a now-closed fish restaurant called Alba. There, I refined my fish-preparation skills and learned how to cook a piece of fish to perfection.With fish, quality is key, of course, but it was how they cooked the skin that really transformed my own fish cooking. Melt a tablespoon of clarified butter in an ovenproof pan or skillet over a medium heat. Lay in a fish fillet skin side down, and resist all temptation to touch it until the skin caramelises and browns on the edges and base. When the flesh turns opaque more than halfway through the fillet, pop the pan in a hot oven for a minute, or until only just cooked, then serve skin side up and enjoy the crisp, flavourful skin.If you’re cooking for someone who won’t eat fish skin, however, or if you’re making a dish that calls for skinned fish, this snack transforms a by-product into something delicious.I’d always recommend keeping the skin on a fish fillet where possible, but if a recipe does call for it to be removed, or you have guests who won’t eat it, consider serving this alongside it, or as a garnish. Fish crackling has a superior texture that is simultaneously crunchy yet chewy, and umami-rich and satiating. It also keeps well in a sealed container, even for months, so long as it stays dry. I especially like it dipped in creme fraiche or soured cream with a sprinkling of cayenne pepper and a little dill.Fish skinFrying oil – organic rapeseed or virgin olive oil, for preferenceSea saltBring a pan of water to a boil, lower in the fish skin and simmer for three minutes. Drain and pat dry with a clean cloth, then cut into rough pieces. Lay these on a wire rack and leave to dry, either in a warm part of the kitchen or in a low oven (preferably alongside something else, to maximise the power usage, and that doesn’t matter if it smells of fish). Once the skin is totally dry, heat a dash of oil in a frying pan on a high heat, add the skin and cook until it puffs up and curls. Remove from the pan, season with salt and it’s good to go, or cool and store."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48924ef5fe51167a05b370e598c7636371edf86e/0_565_3743_2246/master/3743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e6b6236c8188d90c567b487ba909a88","title":"jamie oliver easy vegetarian recipes cauliflower katsu mushroom stroganoff cottage pie pasta fagioli soup","story":"Four vegetarian dishes you’ll keep coming back to: cauliflower katsu curry, mushroom stroganoff, a fiery pasta soup and a cottage pie with porcini and Marmite Sometimes I swap the lentils for borlotti or butter beans – both work really well.10g dried porcini mushrooms2 large leeks 3 carrots500g swede500g celeriacOlive oil3 sprigs fresh rosemary1 tsp cumin seedsSalt and black pepper2kg potatoes40g unsalted butter1 splash semi-skimmed milk1 onion1 tsp Marmite3 tbsp tomato puree1 x 400g tin green lentilsHeat the oven to 190C (170C)gas 5.

I was there when it all went down. Although to be fair, this is probably stretching the definition of “going down”. It seems strange now how febrile the atmosphere was around Mauricio Pochettino’s first game in English football at Southampton back in January 2013, an evening kick-off against Everton set against an entirely overblown sense of lurking civil disorder.Pochettino’s arrival was just a part of this. The real issue was the defenestration of Adkins, a popular and successful incumbent with an agreeable, slightly careworn manner, less elite level football manager, more browbeaten provincial scoutmaster who keeps terrapins.Before kick-off St Mary’s was in a state of high alert. Any traces of Adkins imagery had been expunged, Stalin-style, from the club programme. In the streets club officials “shut down” radio crews looking for Adkins vox pops, as though simply whispering those incendiary words might spark spasms of rage among the Adkins razor gangs roaming the backstreets, or the highly organised Adkins ultras massing at their motorway meet points.Except, it didn’t quite work out like that. The home crowd was orderly and polite. A chorus of “Jason Puncheon – he’s gone for a piss” as Puncheon emerged late for the second half was as close as we got to rabble-rousing. Otherwise there was a general sense of curiosity and respectful applause for the new man, this bear-like, oddly stirring figure on the touchline.Pochettino would later describe that first night at Southampton as “the most difficult moment of my life”. You couldn’t tell. Instead he looked assured, striding about with that familiar Poch charisma, a kind of chest-pumping gaucho manliness that makes you want to cuff him on the shoulders, clap his cheeks, arm-wrestle him, drink in his bristly eau de homme as he whispers inspiring words in your ear about struggle and suffering, before telling you to get up off your knees, wipe away the tears, get out of his office and in future make an appointment.Fast forward almost seven years and Pochettino is now in his own state of retrenchment, perhaps even an Adkins-style turnaround. Tottenham have won seven of 26 games since February. That fearless pressing game has retreated. And Pochettino himself seems to have reached the end of something. He’s fretful with his players. He talks a lot about budgetary restrictions and his own yawn-worthy struggle with the media (who adore him). He has, in effect, become just another football manager. And football managers are dispensable.Poch must go: this unlikely notion is increasingly being floated around the place. It is a strange, sudden kind of collapse. Strange because the feeling is still there that he’s just getting started. But look up and the years have flown. If Pochettino stays to the end of the season he will be Spurs’ joint-second longest-serving manager since the first world war. Is it really time? Unexpectedly, the answer might just be yes.Not that there’s anything wrong with that. This is something new in elite football. For so long it seemed there was too much flux. Suddenly we have a problem with people leaving, a sense of resistance, of profitable congealment. Manchester United, a possible Poch destination, have spent six years basically hiring and firing the same structurally doomed manager – different face, same macro-problems – while continuing to exist in a state of profitable stasis.Pochettino isn’t in it for the money. But he has been affected by that loss of human scale, an era when the old measure of success, jumping up and down on a podium, has become blurred by other ambitions. There is no obvious closure here. How do we know when it’s over?Judging his Tottenham team, his era will remain a matter of context and beyond that, of moments. The best ones have been breathtaking, beginning with the 5-3 scragging of Chelsea on New Year’s Day 2015, when a Spurs team with five Bale-money hang-overs in the squad ran the champions-in-waiting into the ground. The high-energy Pochettino style seemed uplifting and punkish in those early days, flaky old Spurs taking arms against the giants of the modern club game. Even the 2-2 draw at Chelsea in May 2016 when Spurs still might have won the league, when nine players were booked and a two-goal lead lost, still felt like evidence of energy, life, hunger.To live is to suffer, that relentless physicality seemed to say. To survive is to find some meaning in the suffering. But what did it mean? The achievement here is always contextual. For all its emotional power, it remains a feat of hair-shirt economics. Spend less, finish higher.Spurs got rid of 20 players in the two windows after that Chelsea game. From the end of August 2017 to the start of July 2019 only Lucas Moura came in. And it is degrading in the end, running so hard to stand still. Harry Kane had four brilliant years during which he basically flogged his body into the ground, martyred to the cause of stadium, cash flow, fully sustainable economic growth.There is also a kind of beauty in this, the era that isn’t quite an era, where everything seemed to change but only some things changed. Modern football is increasingly meaningless, or at least meaningless judged against the old metrics. This is the lesson of Pochettino’s own strange, vibrant, trophy-less career, a place where the parameters of what can be achieved are pressed thin by larger forces.It has been a thrilling six-year  at Tottenham. Probably Pochettino should make his own move now when the time seems right: a very modern kind of manager, who has given us a very modern kind of success but who seems, right now, to have reached a natural end point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e279d987984df68a1bf09bff1dd109a27e72065a/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c2e688711f4c78bc4bfb7cf58127946","title":"blind date david ollie","story":"What were you hoping for?I’ve kind of lost faith with gay dating, so I was hoping to have my faith in humanity (even just partially) restored.First impressions?Handsome.

Auto-enrolment has changed that, with millions more now saving through company schemes. But a slew of figures out this week tell us just how tough the challenges ahead are.That’s the average amount sitting in pension pots after a lifetime of saving.In total, 645,000 people accessed their pension pots for the first time in 2018-19, according to data from the Financial Conduct Authority, and they had savings totalling £40.1bn.It will get you an income of only £2,500 a year, and even if you add the state pension, you’ll still be below the current minimum wage. Good luck surviving on that.The true picture is probably a fair bit brighter: lots of people have more than one pension pot, with the average brought down by many half-forgotten schemes when people were younger and worked briefly for other employers (one tip to find them: use the Money Advice Service’s tracing guide). Lots also have buy-to-lets for their retirement, which don’t feature in the FCA data at all. But only one in eight of all pension pots in the FCA data were over £250,000, which is the minimum most people are going to need. How much money you will really spend in retirement sparks lots of debate among my colleagues (we’re a fun bunch on the Money desk). I like the Which? survey of its members (and yes, there’s probably a middle class tilt there) which found that retirees typically spent £2,220 a month in 2019, or about £27,000 a year.That’s the average sum paid into a pension by iniduals in Britain in 2017-18, according to HMRC this week. It’s actually down from the year before, when it was £2,900. That’s partly because auto-enrolment helped bring in an extra 1 million savers during the year, many in lower-income jobs, which takes the average contribution down. But however you look at it, £2,700 a year – £81,000 over a 30-year working lifetime – is not going to provide for much, unless the employer pays at least the same amount.That’s the proportion of pension plans that were accessed in 2018-19 without any financial advice, said the FCA. Trouble is, where do you go for advice? We have a shambolic approach which largely relies on a mate who might be able to recommend someone who may not be half bad. Instead, we need employers to step up. They put lots of money into pension schemes, too – why are they not there when their workers retire? Employer-sponsored and paid-for advice at retirement needs to be legally mandated by the government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d43815c49e149ff52f0a4b694e10e95d1b70f2f1/0_71_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=386296e7a4b2498d5cee406969ad2066","title":"doctor who clashed with rees mogg to run as lib dem in javids seat","story":"Dr David Nicholl will contest West Midlands seat of Bromsgrove to expose ‘Brexit dishonesty’The doctor who clashed with Jacob Rees-Mogg over medical supplies in the event of a no-deal Brexit will take on the Conservatives in the next general election as a candidate for the Liberal Democrats.But Dr David Nicholl has decided not to stand against Rees-Mogg, but the chancellor, Sajid Javid, in Bromsgrove in the West Midlands in an effort to expose what he believes is Brexit dishonesty.He expected to be unveiled as the Lib Dem candidate at a meeting of local campaigners on Friday night.The consultant neurologist said he has decided to get directly involved because of the “appalling behaviour” of the last week.“I think the issues have got a whole lot bigger than the no-deal Brexit side of things, it is fundamentally about whether we are prepared to have any honesty in politics now.”But Nicholl is confident he will pick up disenfranchised Tories.“Things are completely different to 2017. I think when you have a prime minister who is prepared to mislead the Queen, you will have many people who vote Tory, not people in the Tory party, in Bromsgrove, who will be utterly appalled with what is going on and will be looking for a new home,” he said.Nicholl joined the Lib Dems earlier this summer. He left the Labour party after Owen Smith, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, was sacked, considering it a decision with damaging consequences for the region.He said he thought the Lib Dems had “clearly got the best chance” to woo remain voters or disenchanted Tory voters and Labour’s decision to remain neutral on Brexit would destroy its chances in the polls.Nicholl said he was not tempted to run against Rees-Mogg because Bromsgrove was his constituency and he would continue to work as a consultant at the Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS trust.Nicholl clashed with Rees-Mogg in early September over contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit he had drawn up for the government for epilepsy and neurology drugs.Rees-Mogg accused Nicholl of fearmongering and told him he “should be quite ashamed” to “try to spread fear across the country” over potential shortages of medicine caused by a no-deal Brexit.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Nicholl told him that he drew up the Operation Yellowhammer plans for his area of expertise. The report outlined the probable consequences of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. He said he had blown the whistle on the plans because he felt they were unsafe.Days later Rees-Mogg, now leader of the House of Commons, was forced to apologise to him after comparing him to the disgraced anti-vaccine doctor Andrew Wakefield, prompting a backlash from the medical profession, including criticism from England’s chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies.This prompted Nicholl to abandon work and join the protests outside parliament, commandeering anti-Brexiter Steve Bray’s megaphone to accuse Rees-Mogg of using parliamentary privilege to attack whistleblowers.Nicholl said he would “certainly hope to get a lot of the remain” votes in Bromsgrove and would rely on a 14-year campaign on the “rule of law” to “bring the fight to Sajid Javid”.Nicholl campaigned for more than a decade to help free Shaker Aamer from the US camp in Cuba and he was finally released without charge in autumn 2015."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a22cc75bebfd0e3a0389a74711191f35f2468da/57_0_3385_2031/master/3385.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2ae1f04a14dd8f269b7ea953b2c0f53","title":"labour promises to overhaul cruel universal credit system","story":"Jeremy Corbyn due to announce proposals at rally in Chingford and Woodford Green constituencyThe Labour party has promised to radically overhaul the “inhuman and cruel” universal credit programme and scrap benefit sanctions as part of ambitious proposals to reform the social security system and reduce poverty.The controversial five-week wait for a first universal credit payment – which has been blamed for destitution, debt and increased use of food banks – will be reduced and phased out, while the benefit cap and two-child benefit limit will be scrapped.A Labour government would sweep away what it says is a “punish and police” culture at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), replacing it with a fresh approach to social security that treats claimants with dignity and respect.It will argue that the current system has failed to provide adequate support for vulnerable people or help people return to work. It says its reforms, run by a newly-named Department for Social Security, will not seek to vilify or punish claimants but, NHS-style, be there for all citizens at their time of need.Jeremy Corbyn is due to announce the proposals on Saturday at a rally in the Chingford and Woodford Green constituency currently held by Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith, who championed universal credit and oversaw its introduction as work and pensions secretary between 2010 and 2016.The Labour leader is expected to say: “Universal credit has been an unmitigated disaster. As well as being behind schedule and over budget it is inhumane and cruel, driving people into poverty and hardship. “Social security is supposed to give people dignity and respect, not punish and police them, make them wait five weeks for the first payment or fill out a four-page form to prove their child was born as a result of rape.“The Tories told us that universal credit would make work pay, but we have seen the opposite. More and more people who are falling into poverty have jobs, and more and more children who are growing up in poverty are living in working families.”The proposals, which come out of a year long party review of welfare policy, commit Labour to a £3bn a year investment in social security. It argues this will save money over time by reducing welfare need by raising incomes, reducing living costs and creating better employment opportunities. Austerity policies will have stripped around £37bn from social security spending by 2021.Universal credit will help support over 7m people who are either jobless, ill or disabled, or in low paid work by the time it is fully rolled out in 2023. It was hoped the digital-only benefit would make the welfare system more efficient, incentivise people to return to work or work more hours, and reduce poverty.However, it has struggled with a series of IT problems and design flaws which means it is not only running six years behind schedule, but proving both politically controversial and unpopular with many claimants. Meanwhile, cuts have reduced work incentives.The Conservatives have introduced a series of piecemeal reforms since 2017 intended to address some of the issues for vulnerable claimants, but campaigners have argued these do not go far enough and more fundamental reform is needed.Although Labour says it will “scrap” universal credit it seems it will not drop all aspects of the payment, which merges six benefits into one. It will remain digital in nature, although Labour says it will end the current “digital only” approach and will hire 5,000 advisers to support claimants unable to access the internet or manage their claims online.It will also allow claimants to be paid fortnightly rather than monthly as now and allow households to split payments between two adults. The current single household payment has been criticised as enabling domestic abusers to control family finances.Benefit sanctions, the two-child limit on child benefit and the benefit cap – seen as unfair, ineffective and key drivers of child poverty – will be scrapped. The party already has plans to scrap the bedroom tax.Commenting on the proposals, Adam Corlett, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Labour has set out some significant reforms, but they sensibly do not amount to actually scrapping universal credit. Now isn’t the time for another huge overhaul of our social security system.“Instead, Labour have focused on reforming universal credit, and scrapping entirely separate benefit cuts that are set to drive up child poverty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe3c1cb433956b9a0562757d544cfad8918c087/0_720_5129_3077/master/5129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d53d103d41d37a518afc6ef41cf46e8f","title":"voters so promiscuous the pollsters working to predict next election","story":"Despite past failures, the polling industry is back in overdrive. But it isn’t easy getting voters to nail their colours to the mastOf course, if polls all said the same thing, there wouldn’t be so many of them. But when they vary so widely, what is the point of them? Over the last few years, as the polling industry has suffered a series of failures, that question has become more urgent. To recap: at the 2015 election, the polls didn’t see the Tory majority coming. Two years later, most of them made the opposite mistake: predicting a Tory majority when we got a hung parliament. In between, came the EU referendum – where the polls weren’t quite so far out, but most put remain ahead.But even if polls aren’t always trusted, their findings are still cheered, lamented, disputed and weaponised. They shape the way journalists talk about parties and politics they put leaders under pressure. This is why they are used by campaigners – groups such as People’s Vote, which has commissioned a series of polls that highlight support for staying in the EU. Not that everyone is willing to accept the results. “My impression is that when people like poll findings, they seize on them and quote them,” says Peter Kellner, the former president of YouGov. “And when they don’t like them, they say: ‘Oh, they got the 2015 election wrong, they got the 2017 election wrong, it must be a load of bollocks.’” Pollsters themselves urge caution. “Polls aren’t magic they can’t predict the future,” says Anthony Wells, YouGov’s director of political research. “But, clearly, they are the only good way we’ve got of measuring public opinion.”And the polls keep coming. This is the strange position pollsters now find themselves in: the turbulence of the times may have caught them out, but it has also made us more dependent on them, as we struggle to decipher the country’s thinking and what on earth might happen next.After two general elections and two referendums in five years, pollsters are as sick of elections as the rest of us. “We’d like to get a rest sometime,” says Gideon Skinner, the head of political research at Ipsos Mori. ICM’s research director, Gregor Jackson, tells me that, if there were another high-profile failure,“We’d have to be honest and ask if there is a long-term future for political polling – in the narrow sense of accurately predicting the results of general elections.” When the next election comes, pollsters know they will face their biggest test yet.On a miserable Saturday morning in July, I arrive at an Ipsos Mori call centre in Leith, Edinburgh. The main room – a sparse space overlooking a park – is filled with 50 people sitting at five banks of desks, each themed around a bright colour. Most of them are young: the call centre employs lots of students, as well as actors, musicians and comedians looking for casual work. They patiently make call after call.Like most polling firms, Ipsos Mori devotes the majority of its work to market research. But I am here to sit in on telephone polling for its monthly Political Monitor: a voting-intention poll, with additional questions about respondents’ political views. This is the most high-profile work the firms carry out, often commissioned by newspapers, but it is also the least lucrative. “Most companies use it as a shop window to build their name,” says Deborah Mattinson, who runs the research consultancy Britain Thinks.For its phone polls, Ipsos Mori calls a mixture of landlines and mobiles that have been selected at random. What surprises me, sitting in the call centre, is just how hard it is to convince people to participate. “That’s actually the biggest problem we have,” says Ian Douglas, a cheery man with white hair, who is the firm’s director of telephone project management. What has made phone polling increasingly challenging is “the number of people you have to convince it’s not a PPI call”, he says. Sometimes they slam down the phone or shout abuse. Interviewers are only expected to complete one 15-minute interview each hour the rest of the time, they are being turned down or ignored.Once they find someone willing to take part, the interviewers launch into their script: a set of questions written by Ipsos Mori’s political team in London. They can’t do anything that might influence the answers, like engage with an interviewee’s jokes or political asides, so some interviewers resort to a stiff, robotic delivery. Others make an effort to keep the interviews lively: one young man with jaunty diction, emphasises different words as he sets out the options on whether Britain will leave the EU without a deal: “Would you say it’s very unlikely, fairly unlikely…” It reminds me of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?.A voting-intention poll is usually based on interviews with between 1,000 and 2,000 people. But they can’t just be the first 1,000 who agree to take part – pollsters need a sample that is representative of the whole country. “The traditional analogy is eating a cake,” says Skinner. “You don’t need to eat the whole cake, you just need to get a good slice.” That means having the right proportion of men and women, 18- to 24-year-olds and over-65s, Scots and Londoners. So, pollsters set quotas for those different categories. Douglas tells me that it is easiest to persuade people over 45 who live in Scotland, Wales or the north of England to take part. It can take four or five days of polling to fill the final quota: 18- to 24-year-old men. They have learned that there are particular times when it is easiest to reach younger age groups: earlier in the week or Saturday mornings. When I arrive, at 11am on a Saturday, the main room is filled with the hubbub of interviewing. But as morning blurs into afternoon, it becomes quieter by the time I leave, it is almost silent.It is no surprise, then, that almost all voting-intention polls now take place online. It is cheaper, easier and quicker. Each agency has its own online panel: a group of people – more than 800,000, in the case of YouGov’s UK panel – who have agreed to take part in surveys, on politics or anything else, in exchange for a small payment.Online polls have quotas to be filled, just like telephone polls. But it is hard to hit every one. So, once the polling has finished, pollsters adjust their results through a process known as weighting: if they needed to poll 120 people aged 25 to 34, but could find only 100, for example, they will make each response in that age group count for 1.2 people.Polling firms weight their results for turnout, too: they take into account what someone says about how likely they are to vote or whether they voted in the previous election. It is this weighting that explains why pollsters can get such different results. “They’ve got a choice of levers to pull,” says Patrick Sturgis, a professor at the London School of Economics who led an independent inquiry into why the polling for the 2015 election went so wrong. “They pull a certain set of levers and it gives the Tories a five-point lead they pull a different set and it gives the Tories a two-point lead.”For decades, voters were split into two main groups – Labour and Conservative – ided by class. “Fifty, 60 years ago, most working-class voters voted Labour, most middle-class voters voted Conservative,” says YouGov’s Kellner. So, if a sample had the right proportion of working-class and middle-class people, pollsters had a decent chance of predicting an election accurately. That is no longer the case. “If you’re middle class, you’re only very slightly more likely to be Conservative than if you’re working class,” says Kellner. “If you’re working class, you’re only very slightly more likely to be Labour than if you’re middle class.”The things that determine how people vote are always changing: to get a representative sample, pollsters must now pay particular attention to age, education, and, of course, views on Brexit. “The leaveremain camps have almost redefined how politics is seen,” says Tanya Abraham, who works on YouGov’s political team. “Because they can be any voter.” James Kanagasooriam, a partner in charge of polling at the lobbying firm Hanbury Strategy, tells me that the two traditional voting blocs have now fragmented into four groups of roughly equal size: as well as traditional Labour and Tory supporters, there is a coalition of liberal, metropolitan, remain-leaning voters, as well as core Brexit supporters. Leave voters can now back the Brexit party, remainers the Lib Dems.“In my professional life, I’ve never known a time when voters have been so promiscuous with their votes,” says Andrew Hawkins, the founder of ComRes. ICM’s Jackson says: “Having a four-party system – and in particular the existence of the Brexit party – just makes it more difficult for polling agencies.” Most polling firms weight their data according to how people voted in the previous general election – but it is impossible to weight by a vote for the Brexit party, because it only launched in April.It is even harder to predict what will happen in a general election, because it is dependent on whether Brexit happens before it takes place. “If we have left, and we haven’t run out of mangetout at Waitrose and people aren’t dying because they’re unable to get the right drugs, then I suspect there’d be a fillip in the polls for the Tories,” Hawkins says. If we don’t leave on 31 October, he suggests, the Conservatives will be in a much trickier position. Meanwhile, Jackson says: “The polling data is showing increasing polarisation in British views towards Boris Johnson. He’s off-putting for many people now, in a way he wasn’t three years ago.”Andrew Cooper is one of British polling’s grandees. The founder of Populus, he spent two years as David Cameron’s director of strategy at No 10. Like many firms, Populus did not come out of the 2015 election well. After that shock, Cooper resolved not to be caught out again. “We did a very, very thorough review,” he says. “It took lots of time, money and intellectual effort.” Eventually, Populus made a number of changes: it started weighting according to how interested people were in politics, for instance, rather than how they identified politically to estimate turnout, it took into account demographic factors, and interviewees’ attitudes, in order to determine how likely different groups were to vote.This time there would be no attempt to put things right. “We came to the conclusion that the underlying methodological problems of voting-intention polls are so fundamental that we can’t solve them,” Cooper says. So that was that: since the referendum, Populus hasn’t carried out a single voting-intention poll. Instead, using data analytics, it looks at what Cooper describes as “the structure of political attitudes” – the patterns behind public opinion. (Similarly, while the  continues to use ICM to carry out polls, the paper has shifted its focus to more in-depth research about public views and attitudes.)“The traditional voting-intention poll is actually just a rubbish product,” adds Cooper. “It’s an attempt, by asking only two questions, to get at what is getting to be an increasingly complicated piece of information.”This is the kind of statement one might expect to hear from a polling sceptic – someone such as Labour peer David Lipsey, who chaired a House of Lords committee that last year produced a critical report on political polling. It called for more oversight and suggested the media give less attention to voting-intention polls at the time, Lipsey urged the industry to “get its house in order”. I meet him at his office, across the road from the House of Lords in Westminster. Protesters are gathered near his window as a man repeatedly yells “Brexit means Brexit”, it feels as if public opinion is intruding very literally into our conversation.If anything, Lipsey is surprised that the polling industry hasn’t attracted more hostile criticism. It wasn’t just the recent errors, he says, pointing to the election of 1992, when the polls mistakenly put Labour ahead, and to 1997 and 2001, when they hugely overestimated Labour’s lead. “In any case, if I predicted election results with a pin, I’d get it right half the time,” he says. Polling does have its uses, he concedes: it is effective at broadly gauging views on a wide range of subjects. But “the worst thing to use it for is predicting the results of elections.”Despite all the challenges that political polling faces, new players are still entering the industry. Last year, two veteran pollsters, Joe Twyman and Martin Boon, set up their own firm, Deltapoll. They thought politics was becoming more emotional, and that this was key to understanding how voters felt.Delta uses something it calls “emotional resonance scoring” (ERS). A traditional poll might ask someone how far they agree with a statement ERS tries to determine the intensity of their feeling, by measuring how quickly – and therefore how emphatically – they respond to it. Twyman gives the example of the EU referendum: polling showed that about as many people agreed with the remain campaign’s warnings about the economy as they did with leave’s “take back control” message but ERS found the latter had twice the emotional resonance.For now, Delta uses ERS to test the strength of voters’ feelings on politicians and parties eventually, Twyman says, it will offer a new way of measuring voting intention.Other firms are also experimenting with cutting-edge techniques to complement traditional methods. They show people speeches by politicians, then measure their heart rate or monitor their facial expressions, which are then recorded using a webcam and analysed by an algorithm to see how intensely they react to the different messages. But when I speak to people in the industry, the development they appear to be most excited about is a kind of modelling called multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP), which YouGov used in the 2017 general election. Traditional voting-intention polls give you each party’s share of the vote for the country as a whole, rather than telling you how many seats they will get. But MRP enables polling firms to forecast election results on a constituency-by-constituency basis.At least political pollsters can take comfort from the fact that voting-intention polls are only a small part of their work. Kanagasooriam compares it to the tip of an iceberg. The real value of polling, he tells me, lies in all the other data. “Why do people vote a certain way? Who’s voting? Where they are on the issues, where they are on the parties, where they are on iniduals, on messages.” He believes that, for all the emphasis on Brexit, voters continue to care about what they have always cared about: which party they trust to look after the economy and which leader they like most.Of everyone I speak to, Kanagasooriam seems the most enthusiastic about what polling can achieve. He energetically describes to me the sophisticated insights offered by data science. It doesn’t matter, he insists, that polling often fails to predict election results, because it keeps getting better at understanding what drives voters – and, at a time of upheaval, politicians need that information more than ever. He points to the Johnson government’s emphasis on tackling crime and investing in the NHS and the rest of the public sector – issues that have, over the past few years, ranked among voters’ top priorities. “This is the first time we have seen an administration actually pivot towards the things that matter for voters.” That’s the kind of impact polling can have, he suggests. “This is what affects stuff in Westminster.”But voting-intention polls can affect Westminster, too. In 2014, 12 days before the Scottish referendum, the Sunday Times ran a YouGov poll showing a two-point lead for independence. It was only one poll – an outlier – but it rattled Britain’s political establishment and compelled David Cameron to launch a final intervention: he promised to give the Scottish parliament more powers if Scotland voted to stay in the UK. And it was encouraging polls in the early months of 2017 that helped convince Theresa May to call a general election, with disastrous consequences.Even after a long career in polling, Ipsos Mori’s Douglas still seems fascinated by what each person has to say. “Your family and friends are a closed network – they usually have a lot of the same views,” he says, as we sit in Leith, dozens of his colleagues on the phone, hundreds of miles away from people at the other end of the line. “It’s easy to think it’s what the rest of the country is thinking, but often it’s not.” While we listen to interviews, he marvels at each surprising response. “The great British public tend to absolutely amaze you, time and time again.”• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b858235a242932e60c4f97a9d0e9f0f4dbc89d35/550_1136_4693_2816/master/4693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd37fda1ac9629420d15a993b876c1c","title":"can labour unite and plot a path to power","story":"Sonia Sodha joins Anushka Asthana to discuss Labour’s options now that parliament has resumed and the party has backed Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit strategy.

After out-scoring France 18-3 in the second-half of a Test they lost last week, they shot into a 28-7 lead in the first half against Tonga, in a match they ended up winning 28-12.It was their hooker, Julian Montoya, who did most of the damage. He scored a hat-trick in 26 minutes, and became the first hooker to score three tries in a World Cup match since Keith Wood did it for Ireland back in 1999. He was substituted just after half-time, so missed most of the gnarly, bad-tempered second half, when the two teams took turns knocking chunks out of each other.Argentina were 28-0 up in half an hour. They scored four converted tries, including those three by Montoya. The first was from a cunning little line-out routine in which the ball was switched the ball back to the hooker, lingering unmarked on the wing. The second and third were more straightforward, one was from a rolling maul, the other the last in a series of pick-and-go drives.Montoya also became the first Argentinian player to score a World Cup hat-trick since Juan Martin Hernandez did it against Ireland back in 2007. There was a fourth try, too, as winger Santiago Carreras ran in from the halfway line.It was shaping up to be a rout, but Tonga got back into it as the half wore on. Telusa Veainu scored after Zane Kapeli, the man who flattened Billy Vunipola when Tonga played England last Saturday, gave Argentina’s fly half Benjamin Urdapilleta a dose of the same treatment.David Halafiona almost scored a second for them on the stroke of half-time, but was shoulder-barged into touch by Tomas Lavanini before he grounded the ball. The refereeing team somehow decided the offence wasn’t even worth a penalty.Veainu did score a second for them, in the 65th minute, a fine low finish tight on the right wing after a brilliant back-of-the-hand off-load from Cooper Vuna."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7da4eed1482b90fefcaf65e5de89a82b829ae5c5/0_44_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f8323add4e5a4829cde2886f865dce5","title":"talking horses lord north cambridgeshire horse racing tips","story":"Fans of the John GosdenFrankie Dettori combination endured a frustrating Friday but Lord North gives them every chance of a better Saturday in the CambridgeshireFans of the John GosdenFrankie Dettori combination endured a frustrating Friday but Lord North (3.40) gives them every chance of a better Saturday at around 8-1 in the Cambridgeshire at Newmarket.

Carty cannot convert though.12 mins: A muscular run from Stockdale as Ireland work it right to left, offloading to Ringrose who almost beats his man around the outside. Japan hold firm but their attempt to run it out does not get far and Ireland continue to pile on the pressure.9 mins: Jack Carty tries the spectacular with a flat cross kick from a penalty trying to pick out Keith Earls. The winger cannot quite pull off the spectacular finish and Japan breathe again. Bold intent from Ireland, turning down easy points.6 mins: Big opportunity missed by Japan to take an early lead as Yu Tamura hooks a straightforward penalty from in front of the posts left. You feel these are the chances that have to go the hosts way.3 mins: If you want to see an upset then this start Japan needed. Confident handling and a rapid tempo from the Brave Blossoms creates the first chance as a little dink rolls towards the Irish line and Ryoto Nakamura is desperately unlucky as he does not get the bounce of the ball..1 min: And we are underway. Ireland earn an early lineout from the kick off.Five minutes until kick-off and the team are heading down the tunnel. Steely faces all around at the Shizuoka Stadium.This is where the test of Japan’s credentials really starts then. After dispatching Russia in empowering but ultimately expected fashion the second best team in the world are in town to ruin the dreams of the Brave Blossoms. Jamie Joseph’s men have enjoyed a seven-day turnaround never usually reserved for the second tier sides at a World Cup and will have needed every minute to prepare for Joe Schmidt’s side. Perhaps a grain of hope can be found for Japan in that they are not facing an Ireland team able to draw on the talents of their world class fly-half, Johnny Sexton. Jack Carty will start at ten as Ireland make four changes to the side that brushed off Scotland. Although, that they could make such light work of of their Six Nations rivals without the need for Sexton to kick rom early in the first half is ominous.Japan captain Michael Leitch is the shock omission from their starting XV, with Joseph opting to bring fit-again Amanaki Mafi into the back row, with flanker Lappies Labuschagne taking over as skipper. For the sequel to the Brighton Miracle, the Shizuoka Shock will need to be equally well executed. In England four years ago, Japan never let South Africa out of their sight, always retaining a measure of control over the scoreline and to earn a repeat would take something similar.

This piece had a quiet stillness, spare set and the magnificent voices of Eric Berryman, Jasper McGruder and Philip Moore all coming together perfectly to bring to life the pain and pathos of work songs, spirituals, and toasts recorded in 1964 in Texas’s then-segregated prison farms. It’s a piece of theatre that exemplifies the very special and unique value of live performance.‘Hilarious and poignant’: freewheelingfrankieI loved Graeae Theatre Company’s by turns hilarious and poignant Reasons to Be Cheerful, which did superb justice to most of Ian Dury’s best songs and wove them into a rite-of-passage story that was much more than a contrived excuse for playing them.‘Blew me away’: dude1981The Flick deserves its spot.

When Valued Friends premiered at Hampstead theatre 30 years ago, it probably seemed very funny and faintly frightening. Stephen Jeffreys’ play is set in the 1980s and sees four thirtysomething flatmates struggle to hold on to their friendships and values when a greedy property developer pounces, desperate to buy their flat in Earl’s Court. It’s a cannily constructed play, but in the context of today’s property crisis, it feels a little bit tame.Despite the latent absurdity of the property boom, the play isn’t a satire, it’s a character-led comedy drama that needs light handling. But director Michael Fentiman overplays his hand, perhaps anxious to assert the play’s relevance. As we track through the 80s, the date is projected against the back brick wall, which is dotted with doors from surrounding flats. During scene changes, pop music booms, and spotlights roam from one door to the next, searching for their next victim. I expect these pounding interludes are meant to reflect the ceaseless rise of the property market and relentless energy of the decade, but they feel out of sync with Jeffreys’ subtle writing.Fentiman coaxes fairly broad performances from his actors, particularly Natalie Casey as the loud-mouthed wannabe comedian, Sherry. Casey has a lot of heart as an actor – the audience instinctively loves her – but she doesn’t need to push quite this hard, while the central relationship between failed musician Paul (Sam Frenchum) and Marion (Catrin Steward) never transitions from a calculated plot device into something a bit softer and more convincing. It’s the comedy cameos that work best: Ralph Davis as Scott and Nicolas Tennant as Stewart impress as the exasperated estate agent and quirky, philosophising builder.As the four friends squabble about the fate of their flat, Michael Taylor’s domestic set gradually fills up with tasteful goods. Occasionally the set rotates, especially after a pertinent line has just been delivered. It’s all a bit too deliberate. But there’s something about the lonely isolation of that grand flat – a floating gold mine just out of reach – that hits a nerve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6191cf5b53e45ce1965260a772098e0f07e66c63/442_333_3144_1886/master/3144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01f6ffc5b30cac1a445470a9310e575e","title":"from 5am starts to the top five dreams napping in numbers","story":"In our fast-paced world, catching zzzs has become more difficult than ever.

The lama pays homage to the mountain deity, spreads tsampa flour on the faces of the climbers and sherpas, and throws the rest in the air for good luck. The climbers lay their boots and crampons, some beer and some Marmite on a stone altar of prayer flags at 5,364 metres. Another 3,484 metres above them is the highest point on the planet.Mountains have always been sacred places – the summits are where heaven meets Earth and the gods meet humanity. Tradition states that if you are foolish enough to heed the call of the sage, the priest, the poet, this is where you begin. Four nights up on a summit and you return either mad or as a poet. Graham Hoyland, who has successfully climbed Everest twice, told me that on both occasions he came down a different man from the one who went up the endeavour changed him.But can we have this life-changing experience without travelling to the Himalayas, without all the oxygen cylinders – and all the expense? To find out, I decided to walk the height of Mount Everest in England – 8,848 metres (29,029 feet) by climbing a succession of England’s hills and mountains, from Cornwall to Cumbria. It had been the toughest two years of my life and what was needed was some space between the past and the future. This was to be as much a spiritual journey as a physical challenge. The big hills and mountains are predominantly on the west side of England so the route pretty much drew itself, and although I drove the longer distances between hills, I used public footpaths to make the climbs.I bought maps, made plans and booked the cheapest B\u0026ampBs I could find – something told me that I should not stay with friends that this journey was to be made alone, with no television, no radio, no weather forecasts. I agreed to take a mobile phone only after a dressing-down from my youngest daughter, but on the understanding that it would remain switched off unless there was an emergency.I set out in late April, with the aim of walking for 12 days, starting in the south-west of England on Brea Hill, a bump on the northern side of the Camel estuary in Cornwall. From there it was on to Bodmin Moor, then Yes Tor on Dartmoor, heading north as the hills increase in height, and finally on to Scafell Pike, the highest peak in England. (I spent a lot of time poring over the question of achieving the height of Everest, and the hills I walked were just under, by five metres, so I climbed one of the pine trees in the graveyard underneath Scafell Pike to make the summit.)As I pulled the car up under Brea Hill, the sun was tinting the clouds lemon yellow and the door to St Enodoc church, sitting at the edge of the dunes, was invitingly open. It seemed like a sign, so rather than waiting to set off the next day, I started my journey there and then. From that point onwards, the months of planning and all the timings were completely skewed – and it was the best decision I made.From Brea Hill the journey wound on to Bronn Wennili, the “Hill of Swallows”, on Bodmin Moor, the highest point in Cornwall at 420 metres. The summit appeared almost like an island in a thick haze of mist. At Yes Tor and High Willhays, on the summit of Dartmoor, it was almost too windy to stand, and it came as a relief to scramble down to the shelter offered by the fabulous Black a Tor copse, twisted with stunted oaks steeped in luminous moss.The wind on Dartmoor was bearing a storm that roared over Great Hangman on Exmoor the next day, flattening the heather and snugging ewes and their lambs into scrapes and walls. The sea beneath the cliffs was almost white with crashing waves, apart from one red tanker swaying alone. Storms shake the template.Australian Aboriginal people describe a certain point in any journey as being “three days deep”. By this they mean that it takes three days alone in the natural world to reach a change in consciousness. After three days, you enter The Dreamtime. Although I made it a rule to greet everyone I passed, there wasn’t any conversation, and in the absence of radio, television and newspapers, the world quietened and the familiar found new forms. Up on the Malvern Ridge, I became aware that it was increasingly a journey into silence, and around each corner was the new lace of spring that I would have otherwise simply walked past.Most of us on this island live on “the plain” – a busy place of people, traffic, sirens, machines, televisions, mobile phones – and we get used to the noise. But once you are above 200 metres or so, the soundscape quietens, and all those hardwired patterns of thought start to loosen their grip. What had started as an extended route march marked by time and distance began to fall away, or maybe I just began to let it all go. And by the time I arrived in the Shropshire Hills, it was in the midst of a heatwave, warm air blanketing a thousand different shades of green shoots and leaves, and lines of early buttercups bubbling up at the side of the paths. Even the rooks, normally brash in spring, were lulled into becoming languorous sentries. I spent the entire day smiling.Travelling further north, more of the hills become mountains. In the UK, any peak above 2,000 feet (610m metres) is classified as a mountain, and there are over 200 mountains in England. These are precious places, because they remain relatively untamed and beyond the savagery of intensive farming. You walk up off the plain, out of the fields around Edale in the Peak District, and follow a stream into a world of heather, white thistles and black peat, ravens, red grouse and grayling butterflies. Halfway up Grindsbrook Clough, a steep boulder climb, the mist came in, burying the ground and leaching confidence out of just about every walker. I ended up sitting down with a group of elderly hikers, none of us really knowing where we were or how to find the summit of Kinder Scout. It was comforting not to be lost alone.The final two days were big days. The Cheviot in Northumberland had patches of snow scattered across the slopes and there were the remains of a wild Arctic light breaking through the clouds. It’s almost a yellow brick road to the summit – paving slabs leading over mire to a desolate trig point, a place where barely anything grows. Really, these are deserts. You walk up into a desert.The final evening was spent at the fabulous Wasdale Head Inn, at the foot of Scafell Pike and Great Gable, the birthplace of British rock climbing. By then I had reached a point where I didn’t want to speak to anyone. After 11 days I had fallen into a sweet solitude, an inner silence, almost a rest from the constant state of working things out, of planning, of reckoning. In the morning, the cloud base was down, shrouding the land above 300 metres. Here, there are no dry-stone walls to rein in the land, and the streams are as yet unnamed. You walk into the mist, into a land of cairns and snow.The hills and mountains of England hold so much more than history, than scenery. They remain sanctuaries, places of real healing. They might not be as flowered as the Alps, as high as the Himalayas, but their gift is that we can leave in the morning, walk up off the plain and on to the summit and be back down by evening. We can walk into another world, another England.Day 1 Brea Hill, Cornwall (62m)Day 2 Bronn Wennili, Cornwall (420m) Yes Tor, High Willhays, Devon (621m)Day 3 Great Hangman (318m) Holdstone Down, Devon (350m)Day 4 Glastonbury Tor (158m) Cheddar Gorge to Beacon Batch, Somerset (414m)Day 5 Crickley Hill (273m) Cleeve Hill, Gloucestershire (330m)Day 6 The Malvern Ridge, Worcestershire (425m)Day 7 Caer Caradoc (459m) Pole Bank, Shropshire (517m)Day 8 Kinder Scout, Derbyshire (636m)Day 9 Haworth to Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire (426m)Day 10 Hebden Bridge to Stoodley Pike (397m) The Calf via Cautley Spout, West Yorkshire (565m)Day 11 The Cheviot, Northumberland (815m) Dungeon Ghyll to Pavey Ark, Cumbria (680m)Day 12 Scafell Pike, Cumbria (978m)Peter Owen-Jones’ complete journey is told in his book, Everest England, available from bookshop for £11.43, including UK p\u0026ampp (RRP £12.99)Looking for a holiday with a difference?

The report also alleges that the NRA may have broken tax laws by using donated funds to further its officers’ business interests.Wyden and other Democrats on the Senate finance committee found that a delegation of NRA officials traveled to Moscow in December 2015.The trip was coordinated with Maria Butina and Alexander Torshin, who are both Russian. Butina is currently serving an 18-month prison sentence after she tried to infiltrate US conservative groups and the NRA to promote Russian political interests around the 2016 election.While in Russia the NRA met with “a host of senior level Kremlin officials”, Wyden said. Those officials included Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin, who oversaw defense and munitions industries.After the trip to Russia, the NRA allowed Butina to bring a delegation from Russia to its influential annual meeting. Wyden said the NRA also “provided access” to other conservative political organizations, including the National Prayer Breakfast and the Council for National Policy.The investigation also found that the then vice-president of the NRA, Pete Brownell, had agreed to go on the trip in exchange for business opportunities in Russia. At least part of the trip was paid for by the NRA, according to the report. Brownell was the vice-president of the organization, which has tax-exempt status, from May 2017 to May 2018.“This report lays out in significant detail that the NRA lied about the 2015 delegation trip to Moscow. This was an official trip undertaken so NRA insiders could get rich – a clear violation of the principle that tax-exempt resources should not be used for personal benefit,” Wyden said in a statement.Also on Friday The New York Times reported that Donald Trump met with the NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre to discuss prospective gun legislation and support for the president as he faces an impeachment inquiry and potentially bruising re-election campaign. It was unclear which side initiated the meeting. The NRA contributed $30m to Trump’s 2016 campaign, more than any other outside group.LaPierre, who has attempted to back Trump away from instituting new background check measures, told Trump to “stop the games” over gun control legislation, two people familiar with the meeting reportedly told NYT.In response to the story, NRA released a statement denying that any quid pro quo was discussed during the meeting: “The NRA categorically denies any discussion occurred about special arrangements pertaining to the NRA’s support of the president and vice versa.”The NRA is being investigated by the attorney general in New York, Letitia James, where the organization is chartered, over its tax-exempt status, and by the Washington DC attorney general, Karl Racine.

Photograph: AFP Expectations rose in Brussels on Friday night that the UK will submit its long-awaited formal proposals on the backstop to the EU at the end of the Tory Party conference next week.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar renewed his calls for Britain to table written proposals next week, but warned that he was “not particularly optimistic” that this would happen.“Based on what’s happened in the last month or two I’m not particularly optimistic,” he said in Los Angeles on Friday night. “But there is still time, albeit time running short. And if we’re going to be in position to agree something at the European Council on the 17th and 18th of October we’re really going to need to work that up in the week or two before it.”Mr Varadkar said it would be “really helpful”to get proposals in writing in the first week of October. “Ones that provide a workable and legally-binding solution to the problem. And that is giving us the assurance that there will be no hard Border between North and South. That the all-island economy will continue to operate, the North side co-operation can continue as envisaged under the Good Friday agreement.”Brussels again warned on Friday that time was running out for a deal. EU sources here say they do not believe leaders will be willing to enter detailed discussions on text at the summit. Meetings have been continuing in Brussels at technical level between the two sides, and on Friday Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay met the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Separately, Tánaiste Simon Coveney also met Mr Barnier, and both men complained that they have yet to see “legally operable” proposals from the UK. Mr Coveney spoke of “wide gaps” remaining. Political willMr Barclay said after the talks that the UK remained “committed to securing a deal”. “The prime minister has made clear he wants a deal, but there has to be political will on both sides, and that’s what we’re exploring.”He also insisted the commission was open to renegotiating the backstop.The backstop is an insurance policy guaranteeing no hard Border on the island of Ireland. London also sees elements of the guarantees Brussels is seeking in any alternative to the backstop as unreasonable. It is prepared to defend the Belfast Agreement, and the integrity of the single market. However, it is understood to believe the requirement to ensure that Brexit should not affect the all-Ireland economy stretches the reasonable interpretation of the Belfast Agreement. A requirement that the result of a Brexit outcome on the Ireland economy would be the same as a no-Brexit outcome is an impossible test, it is argued.They are understood to believe that British prime minister Boris Johnson’s willingness to be flexible on SPS (food and animal health rules) needs to be reciprocated by the EU’s negotiators. Customs controlsTalks on UK “non-papers” on food and animal health rules and east-west trade have reportedly been difficult, particularly on the need for customs controls on the Irish Sea even if there is regulatory alignment between North and South. “What the UK will not accept,” says one EU official, “is that regulatory alignment without membership of a customs union is simply not enough. While customs union membership without regulatory alignment is also not enough.”British sources also deny that it wants to create a deregulated low-standard economy.Ireland’s focus in the Brexit talks is avoiding a no-deal, but Dublin would be amenable to granting a further extension to the UK if no agreement can be reached, Mr Coveney told journalists after his meeting with Mr Barnier. “From an Irish perspective we of course think an extension is preferable to a no deal, but I think there would need to be good reason behind that ask for an extension.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Murphy has left the Socialist Party to form his own far-left party which he will launch on Monday.  File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Here’s a heartwarming little announcement aimed at Paul Murphy – who left the Socialist Party on Thursday – which arrived too late for this week’s Social \u0026amp Personal column.“Mammy \u0026amp Daddy Trotskyist Party have been getting closer for some time now. And today the happy news we’ve all been waiting for with so much excitement: they are expecting a new Trotskyist baby next Monday!”Brendan Ogle, the loved-up union leader who made this announcement on his Facebook page, followed it up on Thursday with an image of Trotsky’s face encircled by little pink love-hearts and the slogan: “Leon Trotsky Thinks You’re Hotsky.”Message for Brendan: Paul Murphy Thinks You’re Flirty.Unite’s boss in Ireland was referring to Murphy’s decision to part company with the Socialist Party, reducing its Dáil strength from three to two deputies (Ruth Coppinger and Mick Barry). But he is staying under the socialist umbrella of the Solidarity-People Before Profit Dáil group, albeit no longer a member of Solidarity but as leader of a new far-left political group which he is launching in Dublin on Monday.Is there a part for Ogle? The limelight-loving activist announced last year that he was setting up a political party. In a television interview in March 2018 he said it would be launched that September. He had a mission statement and everything.September came and went. Nothing happened.A full year on and a new socialist group has arrived, but courtesy of Paul Murphy. He revealed he has been struggling within the Struggle for the last 12 months, leading to this week’s amicable split from his fellow socialists, who are too anti-social for him as they are against increasing co-operation with other left-leaning parties and movements involved in the Struggle.But back to Brendan Ogle, who calls himself “Camilo Ogle” on his Facebook page, perhaps in homage to Camilo Cienfuegos (his name means “a hundred fires”) who is revered in Cuba as a hero of the Revolution. On Thursday, the Dundalk-based campaigner was again musing about a new party, this time on Twitter.“What the left needs is a broad progressive front 2 come together, not 1 Trotskyist party with about 100 active members down here to split into 2 parties. The right wing media will describe this as left chaos,” he wrote, with the hashtag #yetanotherowngoal.Ogle has also been mentioned as a possible left-wing candidate in the Fingal byelection caused by Clare Daly’s departure to the European Parliament earlier this year. Might he unite with Murphy?Irish politics on the left has more progressive fronts now than the weather map.Retired politicos make the cut at Oireachtas golf bashThe Oireachtas golf society held its annual president’s prize competition as the summer recess came to a close this year. Members battled it out on a wet, windy and wild Powerscourt course in Wicklow at the end of August.Former Fianna Fáil senator Donie Cassidy, the society’s president, decided to keep out of the rain and didn’t play. The big prize went to former Fianna Fáil junior minister from Wexford, Hugh Byrne, while another long-retired member took the second prize.Retired, fully pensioned politicians have the life of Riley.The runner-up, former tánaiste and Labour party leader Dick Spring, was recognised on the night with life membership. He was presented with a commemorative lump of mantelpiece fodder by the new EU trade commissioner, Phil Hogan. Big Phil, who paid lavish tribute to Spring, is already an honorary life member of the society.There were tributes and get-well wishes to Brian Cowen, the former taoiseach, who is recovering from a serious illness.Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Oireachtas golf society (where women politicians, past and present, are something of a rarity) and the president’s prize will take place on the Ballyconneely course in Connemara.Singin’ Finian gives fans a free ‘indie’ songJunior Minister Finian McGrath is delighted with his new constituency leaflet.“Four pages, glossy, with a song I wrote myself.”It doesn’t look much different from the leaflets currently winging their way from Dáil and constituency offices all around the country as the general election creeps ever closer. However, Finian has printed a QR code on the back page of his humdrum missive which, when accessed by mobile phone, brings up a YouTube link to the minister singing The Independent Blues.“While Finian demonstrates a steely political determination,” goes the accompanying guff, “he also has a lighthearted side and enjoys political satire and singing.”Don’t we all.He says he wrote the song last year and asks Dublin Bay North constituents, who are the lucky victims, sorry, recipients of his leaflet, to donate a few bob to Br Kevin Crowley’s Capuchin Day Centre if they like his tune.McGrath tells us he has already sent a cheque to Br Kevin following a tsunami-like trickle of donations.“Woke up this morning baby, got the Independent blues You know I woke up this morning baby, got the Independent blues I went down to the Ceann Comhairle I got nothing to lose. Hey now, Ceann Comhairle, don’t you get me wrong I got Shane Ross in the corner and he’s comin’ on strong He don’t want no more judges but Charlie won’t come along.”Boxer Moran and Mary Lou McDonald also get a mention, and the final verse features the Taoiseach.“Hey now, Leo, can’t you help me out? There’s a leaker in the cabinet and I dunno what to do They’re looking at me and they’re blamin Eoghan Murphy too.”Poor Finian won’t be troubling the charts anytime soon.Everyone wants a piece of the budget pie – but is it already eaten?A mini-industry has sprung up in the vicinity of Leinster House since the Dáil returned two weeks ago and the Seanad followed suit a week later.The emails have been pinging into deputies’ and senators’ inboxes at a ferocious rate as representative bodies for businesses, charities and professions start the yearly ritual of the pre-budget presentations. This is where organisations hold information meetings with politicians and tell them what changes in the budget would help them and their members.Buswell’s Hotel across the road from the Kildare Street gates was packed with persuaders bringing their message to sympathetic TDs and Senators who, of course, vowed to have a word in the right ears when they returned to Leinster House. Meetings also took place in the Merrion Hotel and the Alexander Hotel, as groups from various walks of life including the motor industry, farming and the health sector made their pitches.Politicians like to be seen at these events. They talk and take names and armloads of literature. And the people representing the different trade bodies and voluntary organisations – many of them acting in a paid capacity – take loads of photographs for their websites and magazines.But what the inundated TDs probably know, but don’t want to say, is that this year’s budget is more or less done and dusted. Privately, they will tell you that the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, and his Fianna Fáil counterpart and confidence-and-supply shadow, have already agreed the details between them.Leo’s close call with stardom on the mean streets of New YorkIt couldn’t match the dizzy heights of celebrity-hound Leo’s meeting two years ago in Texas with Arnie Schwarzenegger, but the Taoiseach was nonetheless delighted to rub shoulders with US talk-show star Jimmy Fallon in New York on Wednesday morning.Leo was leading an Irish delegation visiting the NBC headquarters for a meeting with TV executives on the Irish film production industry when he bumped into the comedian, who immediately recognised the Taoiseach and invited him to tour the set.Fallon, who has Irish roots, told Varadkar he would love to bring his show to Dublin and the Taoiseach said he would do all he could to assist him. Then he showed him a photo on his phone of Fallon’s pub in Dublin 8. As you do. The comedian said he might have a pint there if he gets his wish to broadcast from here.It must have been a monumental task for Leo’s handlers to extract him from the NBC building when the time came to leave. Why? Because Robert De Niro was Jimmy Fallon’s guest that evening, and he was there to discuss a movie called The Irishman.The Irishman? What a coincidence. Leo could have swaggered up to Robert and in his best Travis BickleTaxi Driver voice gone: “You talking ’bout me?”How de Niro would have loved that.But never mind. Leo has a photo with Jimmy Fallon for his scrapbook. Unfortunately he was unlucky in LA when he attended a breakfast hosted by Tourism Ireland. Jerry Springer turned up at it, but the two men missed each other by minutes.OWL participants learn the wisdom of Leinster HouseA nice good news story in Leinster House this week.The first batch of participants in the groundbreaking Oireachtas Work Learning (OWL) programme graduated at an awards ceremony presided over by Ceann Comhairle, Seán Ó Fearghaíl.The group were part of an applied learning, development and socialisation programme which gave work experience to young adults with an intellectual disability. For the past year, politicians and staff have been meeting these young workers as they go about their duties. The Houses of the Oireachtas is the first parliament in the world to host a programme of this kind.Seven of them have already secured part-time jobs since finishing the course: four in Leinster House, two with the Public Appointments Service and one in the private sector.The Ceann Comhairle was delighted with progress made by the group.“During their time with us, the 10 participants were placed across different offices where they gained valuable experience in multiple areas. We in turn also learned from them. They each brought their own skills and experience and added greatly to the work that is done here every day. Their inidual personalities and the determination they have already shown in their lives up to now served them well.”During their year-long stint they got to experience work in areas such as catering, payroll, administration, library and research and committee offices. The training programme was designed to help them learn skills of employability in a safe and supportive environment.The first graduates of OWL are Andrew Graydon, Brendan Heade, Clare Nolan, Craig McEntee, Dale Cross, Daniel Carroll, Kenny Delahunt, Sarah McNulty, Michael Baldwin and Shane McGuirk. Their families were invited to Leinster House to see them receive their certificates from the Ceann Comhairle and to celebrate their achievement.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4033022.1569620105!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"democrats subpoena mike pompeo in impeachment inquiry","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic representative from California and chairman of the House intelligence committee Adam Schiff: among witnesses that could be summoned are Rudy Giuliani. Photograph: Jim Lo ScalzoDemocrats in the US House of Representatives who are pursuing an impeachment inquiry against president Donald Trump issued a subpoena on Friday to secretary of state Mike Pompeo for documents concerning contact with the Ukrainian government. The impeachment inquiry follows a whistleblower complaint that in a phone call in July Mr Trump solicited a political favour from Ukraine’s president that could help him get re-elected in 2020. The House foreign affairs, intelligence and oversight committees which announced the subpoena also scheduled depositions for five state department officials over the next two weeks, including former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, Kurt Volker, the US special representative for Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU. The state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The committees announced the subpoenas after the Trump administration missed a Thursday deadline to provide documents and information about contacts with Ukrainian officials, as well as the July 25th telephone call between Mr Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. ‘Witch hunt’Mr Trump earlier claimed he is the victim of a “witch hunt” over the ongoing impeachment crisis, as he called on the chair of the House intelligence committee to “resign” over the affair.In a series of tweets on Friday, Mr Trump said that Adam Schiff was a “sick man” who should resign, accusing him of lying to Congress about the contents of the president’s phone conversation with Mr Zelenskiy.Mr Trump also continued his attacks on the anonymous whistleblower at the centre of the story, questioning whether the anonymous complainant is a “partisan operative”.His comments came as the House intelligence committee, led by Mr Schiff, announced it would work through the two-week congressional recess which commenced on Friday in order to continue the impeachment inquiry announced by House speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this week. The committee may subpoena iniduals named in documents relating to the controversy. Among the witnesses that could be summoned are Mr Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who has admitted trying to seek Ukrainian support for an investigation into Mr Trump’s political rival Joe Biden. Whistleblower complaintMeanwhile, Ms Pelosi said during a television interview on Friday she believes attorney general Bill Barr has “gone rogue”.Mr Barr was mentioned by Mr Trump during his phone conversation with Mr Zelenskiy in which he asks the Ukrainian leader to investigate Joe Biden.The department of justice has also been accused by congressional Democrats of blocking attempts by the director of national intelligence to pass on the whistleblower complaint to the Senate and House intelligence committees as required by law.Ms Pelosi also said she was concerned about Mr Trump’s characterisation of the anonymous whistleblower, and of those who had raised concerns with him or her about the president’s behaviour.Mr Trump suggested that those involved are close to “spies”, noting that in the old days spies were treated differently.The House speaker vowed to continue the impeachment inquiry into the president’s behaviour, while also repeating her assertion that the director of national intelligence should have passed on the whistleblower complaint to Congress.‘Filled with rage’But Republican senator Ted Cruz told Fox News that he believed Ms Pelosi does not really support impeachment, but is instead facing pressure from liberal members of the Democratic Party who are “filled with rage”.As the controversy over Mr Trump’s phone call with Mr Zelenskiy and claims by a whistleblower that White House officials tried to conceal evidence of that call continued, more than 300 former US national security and foreign policy officials signed a statement supporting an impeachment inquiry. “President Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic processes. That would constitute an unconscionable abuse of power,” they wrote. “It also would represent an effort to subordinate America’s national interests – and those of our closest allies and partners – to the president’s personal political interest.” Additional reporting: ReutersRead more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Man arrested after police officer hit by Mini which failed to stopComment: Call me old-fashioned, but I’m not sure breaking the law is a good ideaComment: Road verges are Britain’s secret gardens where the wild flowers bloom\tThousands join Greta Thunberg in Canada climate strikesIf Boris Johnson wants to \u0026#39Get Brexit Done\u0026#39 he must take big decisionsBBC\u0026#39s decision to scrap licence fees for over 75s could lead to fraud \u0026#39bonanza\u0026#39 of criminals posing as officials Meghan visits memorial to murdered student in \u0026#39personal gesture\u0026#39Labour sets sights on Iain Duncan Smith\u0026#39s seat with Universal Credit announcementChip your cats or face fines, owners warnedBritain will have toughest trophy hunting rules in the world as Government announces ban of \u0026#39morally indefensible\u0026#39 actAnti-racism event hosted by Edinburgh University bans white people from asking questionsBoris Johnson announces funding for world’s first nuclear fusion plantCould Elizabeth Warren end up the real winner from the Trump impeachment inquiry? John Bercow diminished impartiality of the Speaker, claims his deputyBoris Johnson referred to police watchdog over links with Jennifer Arcuri Tory Party chairman James Cleverly: Abuse of MPs is \u0026#39horrible\u0026#39 and should never be \u0026#39normalised or accepted\u0026#39Facebook rejects Priti Patel\u0026#39s call for \u0026#39backdoor\u0026#39 access to encrypted messages to combat terrorism and abuseAI and facial recognition used for first time in job interviews in UK to find best applicantsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/13/09/boe.jpg","title":"business news live pound brexit exchange rate interest bank england","story":"Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Premium free for 1 monthSee the optionsAs it happened EndedThe pound has dropped more than half a cent against the dollar this morning after a senior Bank of England policymaker suggested interest rates may be cut soon.Michael Saunders said the BoE could “loosen policy” - meaning cut rates - in the event of prolonged Brexit uncertainty, even if the UK avoids a no-deal departure from the EU.Please wait a moment for the live blog to load...Welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of business and economics events.\u0026nbspSterling has dropped sharply this morning after Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders suggested that interest rates could be cut to cushion the blow of prolonged Brexit uncertainty.\u0026nbspPreviously the Bank had hinted that it would only cut rates in the near future if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.\u0026nbspThe pound fell to £1.228.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMichael Saunders, a member of the Bank of Engalnd\u0027s rate-setting committee said:\u0026nbspIf the UK avoids a no-deal Brexit, monetary policy also could go either way and I think it is quite plausible that the next move in Bank Rate would be down rather than up.One scenario is that Brexit uncertainty falls significantly and global growth recovers a bit... In this case, some further monetary tightening (limited and gradual) is likely to be needed over time.Another scenario, and this is perhaps more likely to me, is of prolonged high Brexit uncertainty (even without a no-deal Brexit actually occurring). In this case, it might well be appropriate to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for an extended period and perhaps to loosen policy at some stage, especially if global growth remains disappointing.WeWork is selling its $60m Gulfstream private jet\u0026nbspWeWork, the troubled office rental firm that bills itself as a revolutionary tech company, appears to be getting a much-needed dose of reality after abandoning its disastrous plans to sell shares to the public.\u0026nbspNow that controversial founder Adam Neumann has been removed as CEO, WeWork is selling off its $60m Gulfstream private jet and has halted all new lease agreements in a bid to stem massive losses.\u0026nbspSome people will be asking why\u0026nbspa start-up that was burning through billions of dollars of funding from private investors was allowed to splash $60m on a plane in the first place.\u0026nbspTwo new chief executives brought in to inject some sanity into the company are reportedly seeking to oust roughly 20 of Neumanns friends, including some senior managers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat next for the pound?\u0026nbspSterling has taken a pummeling this morning in response to comments from a\u0026nbspBank of England policymaker.\u0026nbspBut...\u0026nbspUBS thinks the pound is likely to rise as Brexit political wranglings run their course.\u0026nbspThe latest twist in the Brexit saga was the UK Supreme Court’s decision that the suspension of the UK Parliament, which strongly opposes a no-deal Brexit, was unlawful.\u0026nbspOur base case remains for the UK to ask for an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline instead of leaving the EU without a deal.

Nearly two thirds don’t think they are able to plan.\u0026nbspBusinesses that have prepared have spent about\u0026nbsp£2,000, according to the FSB\u0027s survey.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThat average cost rises to £3,000 for smaller businesses that export and import.\u0026nbspThe falling pound has helped push up the FTSE 100 which is full of multinationals that generate revenues in other currencies.\u0026nbspThe blue-chip index is up 0.8 per cent to 7,412.52 this morning.\u0026nbspMining shares have done well with Evraz, Glencore and Anglo American all on the rise.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspConsumer confidence up in September\u0026nbspConsumers are feeling a little better than they did last month, suggesting they are keeping their fingers crossed in the run up-to the 31 October Brexit deadline, according to a new poll.\u0026nbspGfK\u0027s long-running index of what shoppers are thinking moved up to (minus) -12 in September from -14 in August, meaning more people are still pessimistic than optimistic.\u0026nbspPeople are very downbeat about the economy but much more positive when it comes to their own personal financial situation, the survey\u0026nbspreveals.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJoe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, says:\u0026nbsp“More mixed signals this month as consumers continue to feel less than positive about the state of their personal finances and the general economy.\u0026nbspYes, all sub measures are higher, but they are anaemic in the case of our purchase intentions and how we view our wallets, while the results on the wider economy are still depressed.\u0026nbspSince the Brexit referendum we have witnessed a long succession of negative Overall Index scores with the overall trend downwards. This month, British consumers appear to be treading water during this wait-and-see run-up to October 31st.\u0026nbspConfidence is an important indicator which typically increases as the economy expands and decreases when the economy contracts and so far, consumer confidence is holding up.\u0026nbspWe certainly have a long way to go to match the record low headline score of -39 witnessed during the early days of the last recession.

It gave no additional details.\u0026nbspA source close to the matter said prosecutors in the Congo probe were alleging Descalzi had not disclosed the fact that his wife, Marie Magdalena Ingoba, was behind Petroservice. Eni declined to comment.“I firmly reject the alleged accusation.

much of the power they actually supply may comes from fossil fuels, Which? has argued.Green Star Energy, Ovo Energy, Pure Planet, Robin Hood Energy, So Energy, Tonik Energy and Yorkshire Energy all sell “100 per cent renewable” electricity tariffs but do not generate any renewable energy themselves or buy any directly.Instead they buy Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) certificates, whose purpose is to prove to the final customer that a given share of energy was produced from renewable sources.The average household uses a little over 3MWh of electricity per year, meaning

Steven Day, co-founder of Pure Planet, said that any suggestion it misled customers is untrue and that Which?’s report demonstrates a “fundamental misunderstanding of the way electricity is generated, certified, traded, managed by the grid and supplied”.He added: “All green suppliers have to use REGOs to verify that the electricity used by their customers is matched by electricity generated from renewable sources.”Which? analysed more than 300 energy tariffs and found that 40 suppliers sold what they described as 100 per cent renewable options.It said much greater clarity is needed around how “renewable” energy is defined and marketed to ensure customers aren’t misled.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others go a step further and generate renewable electricity themselves or buy it from those that do, rather than relying on REGO certificates.Both Ecotricity and Good Energy source enough renewable electricity to match their customers’ usage, but this tends to mean their costs are higher and therefore their tariffs are more expensive.Recognising that these firms directly support renewable energy, regulator Ofgem exempted both companies from its price cap on standard variable tariffs.Richard Headland at Which? said: “As consumers grow ever-more environmentally-conscious, it’s concerning that some suppliers appear to be ‘greenwashing’ their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers.“We believe there needs to be greater clarity on how renewable electricity is defined and marketed. People can only make informed decisions about where to buy their energy from if firms are more upfront and transparent about their green credentials.”Green Star Energy and Foxglove Energy both said they source all electricity from renewable generators, but Which? said the firms do not own renewable generation or have contracts with renewable generators and buy REGO certificates to match customers\u0027 use.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A protective award is additional redundancy compensation ordered by an employment tribunal if the staff weren’t consulted by their employer before being let go.Although there is no guarantee the claims will be successful, they are “worth bringing”, says Richard Linskell, employment partner at law firm Gunnercooke.“In this case, there’s an argument that the management knew about the insolvency in advance,” he adds.“Whether they knew about it long enough in advance to consult on redundancies is another matter. They were trying very hard to avoid the insolvency but that does not preclude them consulting at the same time.”Simpson Millar gave the example of one ex-employee who found out she had lost her job from a generic email at 1am on Monday morning.“We knew there were difficulties earlier in the year, but they were played down internally,” Claire Hoang from Stalybridge in Manchester was quoted as saying.In other cases, former Thomas Cook workers did not even receive the email and instead learnt of their fate via the news, the law firm said.Ex-employees can claim a protective award only if they were made redundant alongside at least 19 other people at the same place of work. That would exclude people from smaller Thomas Cook stores.The compensation is separate from basic redundancy pay and wages and benefits owed, but both are paid by the government’s Insolvency Service if the employer has gone under. \u0026nbspAccording to the latest figures from the Insolvency Service, 6,002 out of 9,041 Thomas Cook employees in the UK have been made redundant since the firm collapsed on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A Labour government would move towards a 32-hour working week, raise the minimum wage to “at least £10 an hour”, ban zero-hours contracts and give all workers full employment rights from day one of employment, he pledged.He said he believed in “working to live, not living to work”.Eyes will now turn to the Conservative Party conference, which is scheduled to get underway on Sunday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In this case, some further monetary tightening (limited and gradual) is likely to be needed over time.Another scenario, and this is perhaps more likely to me, is of prolonged high Brexit uncertainty (even without a no-deal Brexit actually occurring). In this case, it might well be appropriate to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for an extended period and perhaps to loosen policy at some stage, especially if global growth remains disappointing.WeWork is selling its $60m Gulfstream private jet\u0026nbspWeWork, the troubled office rental firm that bills itself as a revolutionary tech company, appears to be getting a much-needed dose of reality after abandoning its disastrous plans to sell shares to the public.\u0026nbspNow that controversial founder Adam Neumann has been removed as CEO, WeWork is selling off its $60m Gulfstream private jet and has halted all new lease agreements in a bid to stem massive losses.\u0026nbspSome people will be asking why\u0026nbspa start-up that was burning through billions of dollars of funding from private investors was allowed to splash $60m on a plane in the first place.\u0026nbspTwo new chief executives brought in to inject some sanity into the company are reportedly seeking to oust roughly 20 of Neumanns friends, including some senior managers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat next for the pound?\u0026nbspSterling has taken a pummeling this morning in response to comments from a\u0026nbspBank of England policymaker.\u0026nbspBut...\u0026nbspUBS thinks the pound is likely to rise as Brexit political wranglings run their course.\u0026nbspThe latest twist in the Brexit saga was the UK Supreme Court’s decision that the suspension of the UK Parliament, which strongly opposes a no-deal Brexit, was unlawful.\u0026nbspOur base case remains for the UK to ask for an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline instead of leaving the EU without a deal. GBPUSD currently trades at 1.23, well below our purchasing power parity estimate of 1.58.\u0026nbspI should point out this guidance was issued just before Michael Saunders\u0027 latest comments.... See blowSmall firms in \u0027urgent need\u0027 of Brexit support\u0026nbspSmall businesses are in urgent need of more government support to overcome a worrying lack of preparedness for a no-deal Brexit, according to\u0026nbspthe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).\u0026nbspAmong the 39 per cent of small firms that think a no-deal will negatively impact them, only one in five have planned or prepared for anticipated issues. Nearly two thirds don’t think they are able to plan.\u0026nbspBusinesses that have prepared have spent about\u0026nbsp£2,000, according to the FSB\u0027s survey.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThat average cost rises to £3,000 for smaller businesses that export and import.\u0026nbspThe falling pound has helped push up the FTSE 100 which is full of multinationals that generate revenues in other currencies.\u0026nbspThe blue-chip index is up 0.8 per cent to 7,412.52 this morning.\u0026nbspMining shares have done well with Evraz, Glencore and Anglo American all on the rise.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspConsumer confidence up in September\u0026nbspConsumers are feeling a little better than they did last month, suggesting they are keeping their fingers crossed in the run up-to the 31 October Brexit deadline, according to a new poll.\u0026nbspGfK\u0027s long-running index of what shoppers are thinking moved up to (minus) -12 in September from -14 in August, meaning more people are still pessimistic than optimistic.\u0026nbspPeople are very downbeat about the economy but much more positive when it comes to their own personal financial situation, the survey\u0026nbspreveals.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJoe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, says:\u0026nbsp“More mixed signals this month as consumers continue to feel less than positive about the state of their personal finances and the general economy.\u0026nbspYes, all sub measures are higher, but they are anaemic in the case of our purchase intentions and how we view our wallets, while the results on the wider economy are still depressed.\u0026nbspSince the Brexit referendum we have witnessed a long succession of negative Overall Index scores with the overall trend downwards. This month, British consumers appear to be treading water during this wait-and-see run-up to October 31st.\u0026nbspConfidence is an important indicator which typically increases as the economy expands and decreases when the economy contracts and so far, consumer confidence is holding up.\u0026nbspWe certainly have a long way to go to match the record low headline score of -39 witnessed during the early days of the last recession. But will it stay that way? You can almost sense people are keeping their fingers crossed.”Crisis? What crisis?\u0026nbspCommenting on the latest consumer confidence numbers,\u0026nbspSamuel Tombs chief UK\u0026nbspeconomist Pantheon Macroeconomics says:\u0026nbspConsumer sentiment is continuing to hold well up well, despite the chaos in Westminster and the lingering risk of a no-deal Brexit.The composite index now is close to its 1974-to-present average of -9, and slightly exceeds its year-to-date average of -13.\u0026nbspHouseholds remain downbeat about the outlook for the overall economy, with the relevant balance still hovering at levels last seen in 2011. But households do not expect broader economic difficulties to affect them confidence about the outlook for their \u0026nbsp personal finances is only fractionally below pre-referendum levels.\u0026nbspHowever, he cautions:\u0026nbspLooking ahead, the slowdown in both employment and wage growth signalled by most surveys suggests consumers’ optimism might begin to fade.\u0026nbspIn addition, we doubt that the forthcoming election will lead to a swift resolution of Brexit uncertainty indeed, the current level of consumers\u0027 confidence points on past form to another hung parliament.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson\u0027s tax cuts will hand billions to higher earners\u0026nbspThe tax cuts promised by Boris Johnson would cost billions and benefit mostly higher earners, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said, proposing a different way to help people on low incomes.Oil giant\u0027s CEO under investigation over Congo dealings\u0026nbspItalian oil and gas group Eni said on Thursday its chief executive, Claudio Descalzi, was under investigation for a conflict of interest issue over dealings in the Congo, Reuters reports\u0026nbspIn a statement Eni said CEO Descalzi had been served notice by prosecutors he was being probed for not disclosing certain information regarding relations between Eni’s Congo unit and a company called Petroservice. It gave no additional details.\u0026nbspA source close to the matter said prosecutors in the Congo probe were alleging Descalzi had not disclosed the fact that his wife, Marie Magdalena Ingoba, was behind Petroservice. Eni declined to comment.“I firmly reject the alleged accusation. It is without any foundation,” Descalzi said in the statement.Natwest app down: Business customers having trouble logging into Bankline\u0026nbspSome NatWest customers are unable to log into the desktop version of the lender\u0027s Bankline app for businesses, the bank has said.\u0026nbspWe’re aware that some customers may be experiencing issues logging in to Bankline. This is currently under investigation however, we would advise that you try reconnecting at regular intervals. Apologies for any inconvenience, NatWest said on Twitter in response to complaints.\u0026nbspA spokesperson for the bank said the mobile Bankline app is unaffected.\u0026nbspThe outage follows another incident with the app on Thursday, which showed some customers other firms\u0027 accounts when they logged in with their own details. The problem has been resolved. \u0026nbspTobacco shares continue to slide after vaping warning\u0026nbspShares in Imperial Brands which makes cigarettes including Lambert \u0026amp Butler are tumbling again after health chief in the US warned people to stop vaping immediately.\u0026nbspA second death in the US state of Oregon from a vaping-related illness yesterday prompted the strongest warning yet from experts.\u0026nbsp“If you vape, whether it’s cannabis, nicotine or other products, please quit. If you haven’t started vaping, don’t start,” said\u0026nbspHealth officer Dr Dean Sidelinger.\u0026nbspImperial, which has pinned its hopes for growth in developed markets on the uptake of tobacco-free products has seen billions wiped off its stock market valuation in the last couple of days.

Until 2005 the website celebrated its birthday on September 7, supposedly marking the day it became an incorporated company.But the company actually filed incorporation papers on September 4, 1998, though it has never used this date as its birthday. Since 2005 it has marked its birthday on September 8, September 26 and, more recently, September 27.“When is Google’s birthday? I’m not sure even we know,” wrote Google employee Ryan Germick in 2013, adding: “Still, while there’s some differing opinions about when to bust out the candles and cake, one fun fact is that our first Doodle was posted even before Google was officially incorporated (30 August, 1998 vs 4 September, 1998).”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.The preview of the album was additionally preceded by a preview clip of a film titled Jesus is Lord, which Kardashian West claimed in her Instagram Story will be screened in IMAX cinemas in October.It is currently unknown whether the mystery film is a documentary or a feature.Jesus is King is the second project from West to be shelved last-minute in less than a year.Yandhi, which was announced by Kardashian on Twitter, was expected to be released last September. It was then pushed back to a 23 November release date, but never arrived.

But it is still unclear how they might have formed, a question to which the answer could shed important light on how humanity and all other life on Earth was able to begin.Nasa scientists get unprecedented view as black hole rips apart a starTo conduct the experiment, the researchers used\u0026nbspan ultra-high vacuum reaction chamber to create a simulation of the conditions inside of those huge gaseous clouds. They constantly sprinkled a gaseous mixture of\u0026nbspwater, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and methanol onto a material made to simulate cosmic dust, which was cooled down to -263C, and then hit with lamps that could kick off chemical reactions.Out of that machine came an icy film that gathered on the simulation of the dust that was inside the chamber. When researchers warmed that up and then analysed it, they found those nucleobases that are required to create\u0026nbspDNA and RNA, which are in turn required for life.They also found other interesting materials, such as amino acids, which make up proteins.Our findings suggest that the processes we reproduced could lead to the formation of the molecular precursors of life, said\u0026nbspYasuhiro\u0026nbspOba\u0026nbspin a statement. The results could improve our understanding of the early stages of chemical evolution in space.Previous experiments might actually have created those\u0026nbspnucleobases, the researchers said, but those conducting them did not have the highly precise measuring techniques to see that they were there.building blocks of life\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

sell “100 per cent renewable” electricity tariffs but do not generate any renewable energy themselves or buy any directly.Instead they buy Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) certificates, whose purpose is to prove to the final customer that a given share of energy was produced from renewable sources.The average household uses a little over 3MWh of electricity per year, meaning

Steven Day, co-founder of Pure Planet, said that any suggestion it misled customers is untrue and that Which?’s report demonstrates a “fundamental misunderstanding of the way electricity is generated, certified, traded, managed by the grid and supplied”.He added: “All green suppliers have to use REGOs to verify that the electricity used by their customers is matched by electricity generated from renewable sources.”Which? analysed more than 300 energy tariffs and found that 40 suppliers sold what they described as 100 per cent renewable options.It said much greater clarity is needed around how “renewable” energy is defined and marketed to ensure customers aren’t misled.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others go a step further and generate renewable electricity themselves or buy it from those that do, rather than relying on REGO certificates.Both Ecotricity and Good Energy source enough renewable electricity to match their customers’ usage, but this tends to mean their costs are higher and therefore their tariffs are more expensive.Recognising that these firms directly support renewable energy, regulator Ofgem exempted both companies from its price cap on standard variable tariffs.Richard Headland at Which? said: “As consumers grow ever-more environmentally-conscious, it’s concerning that some suppliers appear to be ‘greenwashing’ their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers.“We believe there needs to be greater clarity on how renewable electricity is defined and marketed. People can only make informed decisions about where to buy their energy from if firms are more upfront and transparent about their green credentials.”Green Star Energy and Foxglove Energy both said they source all electricity from renewable generators, but Which? said the firms do not own renewable generation or have contracts with renewable generators and buy REGO certificates to match customers\u0027 use.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Astronomers did not expect that such a small star would be able to serve as home to such a vast planet.Around such stars there should only be planets the size of the Earth or somewhat more massive Super-Earths, said Christoph Mordasini, professor at the University of Bern and member of the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) PlanetS. GJ 3512b, however, is a giant planet with a mass about half as big as the one of Jupiter, and thus at least one order of magnitude more massive than the planets predicted by theoretical models for such small stars.The Spanish-led team who first spotted the planet wrote in the journal Science that the newly confirmed planet did not form the usual, gradual way, where a solid core of merging particles takes shape before a gas buildup. Instead, in a surprise to scientists, the planet seems to have arisen straight from gas.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberLead author Juan Carlos Morales of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia said the planet may be almost as big as its star. A year there is about 200 days.It was very exciting finding this planet because it was completely unexpected, Morales wrote in an email. The results indicate a new population of massive planets may also exist around low-mass stars.Nasa scientists get unprecedented view as black hole rips apart a starMorales and his team maintain that gravitational instability in a young star\u0027s disk of gas and dust could, in some cases, result in the quick formation of huge gas planets — even when the star is minuscule. This new world is an extraordinary candidate for this process, said Hubert Klahr of Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany, part of the research team. This find prompts us to review our models.In a companion article, Yale University astronomer Greg Laughlin, who was not involved in the study, pointed out that more than 4,000 so-called exoplanets have been confirmed in solar systems outside our own. While another new one, by itself, is no longer particularly noteworthy, he said, one that challenges current theories of planet formation can animate astronomers.The planet orbiting this particularly small and cool red dwarf star, officially known as GJ 3512, is at least half the mass of Jupiter. Scientists are unable to measure its dimensions, but models indicate it may be comparable to Jupiter in size, according to Morales.Using observatories in Spain, the researchers repeatedly studied the star\u0027s wobbling motion to disclose the planet in its lopsided orbit, rather than rely on the transit method in which a brief, periodic dimming of starlight indicates a planet passing in front of its star.The star is so faint it almost didn\u0027t make it into the group\u0027s survey. Scientists needed more small stars for sampling and so added a few at the last minute.We were lucky to do so because otherwise we would have never made this discovery, Ignasi Ribas, director of the Catalonia space studies institute, said in a statement.Morales and his colleagues continue to search for a second planet orbiting this dwarf star. There may have been a third planet that was ejected from the system long ago, they noted.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A protective award is additional redundancy compensation ordered by an employment tribunal if the staff weren’t consulted by their employer before being let go.Although there is no guarantee the claims will be successful, they are “worth bringing”, says Richard Linskell, employment partner at law firm Gunnercooke.“In this case, there’s an argument that the management knew about the insolvency in advance,” he adds.“Whether they knew about it long enough in advance to consult on redundancies is another matter. They were trying very hard to avoid the insolvency but that does not preclude them consulting at the same time.”Simpson Millar gave the example of one ex-employee who found out she had lost her job from a generic email at 1am on Monday morning.“We knew there were difficulties earlier in the year, but they were played down internally,” Claire Hoang from Stalybridge in Manchester was quoted as saying.In other cases, former Thomas Cook workers did not even receive the email and instead learnt of their fate via the news, the law firm said.Ex-employees can claim a protective award only if they were made redundant alongside at least 19 other people at the same place of work. That would exclude people from smaller Thomas Cook stores.The compensation is separate from basic redundancy pay and wages and benefits owed, but both are paid by the government’s Insolvency Service if the employer has gone under. \u0026nbspAccording to the latest figures from the Insolvency Service, 6,002 out of 9,041 Thomas Cook employees in the UK have been made redundant since the firm collapsed on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We no longer publish any such information.”They ignored questions asking why the data they claim is a national security risk was easily accessible via the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, nor whether it had made any efforts to contact the Internet Archive to remove the supposedly national security-threatening data.Freedom of Information\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

will say – in a speech to be delivered in the Essex constituency of Iain Duncan Smith, the former minister who introduced it.“As well as being behind schedule and over budget, it is inhumane and

suggested universal credit could merely be reshaped, rather than scrapped outright, but Mr Corbyn pledged sweeping “immediate” changes to:* End the two-child limit for receiving the benefit, which official figures show has affected almost 600,000 children.* Pay the benefit after two weeks – after repeated criticism of the DWP for failing to end five-week waits, as promised.* Allow ‘split payments’ – after warnings that single household payments penalise women, particularly those at risk of domestic violence – and pay the child element to the primary carer.* Make payments directly to landlords, as with housing benefit, after an explosion in debt owed by vulnerable tenants.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and

A Labour government would move towards a 32-hour working week, raise the minimum wage to “at least £10 an hour”, ban zero-hours contracts and give all workers full employment rights from day one of employment, he pledged.He said he believed in “working to live, not living to work”.Eyes will now turn to the Conservative Party conference, which is scheduled to get underway on Sunday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But there is expectation that they will resume again in the future, with the US president desperate to get US forces back home before the election next year, allowing him to claim credit for ending the longest war in America’s history.Many of the candidates in the coming Afghan election, including some who would not have countenanced this happening in the past, now say\u0026nbspthe push for Taliban involvement in government is going to get stronger over the coming months and may be difficult to resist.\u0026nbspThis is likely, they say, not just because of the signals from Washington\u0026nbspbut the violent reality on the ground, with the Taliban\u0026nbspand other Islamist groups like al-Qaeda and Isis controlling expanding swathes of territory, and war weariness from a population suffering relentless bombings and shootings.\u0026nbspThe star attraction at the Bamiyan rally is Abdullah Abdullah, who had been\u0026nbspco-leader of the current National Unity Government with President Ashraf Ghani and who is now his main rival at the polls.Bamiyan via helicopter on Wednesday\u0026nbsp(Getty)As we fly\u0026nbspup to Bamiyan together from Kabul on an army helicopter, Dr Abdullah, who had the title of chief executive in the administration, tells\u0026nbspof the need to find a way to end the bloody conflict, and how power-sharing with the Taliban could be the answer.“The Taliban are a reality in the country, their forces, their supporters, their foreign connections. Everybody agrees you cannot finish this war by just fighting and killing everybody. Hopefully the Taliban see it as well,” he said.“The point is to move to a solution, and one I would like to have is an interim set-up. All sorts of possibilities have to be looked at, including power-sharing. Then there is a permanent solution, and that will be through elections.Dr Abdullah was once a key lieutenant of the Northern Alliance Commander Ahmed Shah Masood,\u0026nbsp‘the Lion of Panjshir’, and fought alongside him in years of bloody conflict against\u0026nbspthe Taliban.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Americans are concerned – they think they can get troop levels down to zero – and so there is urgency to all this, and we need to take this seriously.”There are many among the people of Bamiyan who will view the Taliban regaining authority with great trepidation. The Hazara Shias of the region were the victims of a number of massacres and mass rapes at the hands of the Pashtun Sunni Islamists during the savage civil war.Bamiyan province has experienced clashes between the two ethnic groups since the fall of the Taliban. Its wondrous landscape of mountains, gorges and valleys, deep green fields and turquoise lakes – and fascinating architecture from its time as a conduit of the Silk Road – have largely escaped the strife of recent years.There has been investment in infrastructure and education and promotion of woman’s rights. Four years after the Taliban were whipping women for not wearing the burqa, Habiba Sarabi in Bamiyan became Afghanistan’s first female governor in 2005.But the region has become more isolated. The roads to Kabul in the southeast are now dangerous, as are the roads to Kunduz and Mazari Sharif in the north. In the autumn of last year, the Taliban fighters began targeting Hazara residents in the central provinces of Uruzgan and Ghazni. Hundreds of people were killed and thousands displaced in the fighting which followed.Residents of Bamiyan, like those in other parts of the country, have received messages from the Taliban to keep away from election rallies during the campaign and polling stations on voting days. But a group of young students waiting to hear Dr Abdullah and the fellow speakers in his coalition, Karim Khalili and Mohammed Mohaqiq, point out they have\u0026nbspno intention of being put off by the threats. They have\u0026nbspcome to confirm they are making the right decision when they vote in Saturday’s presidential election.“It’s the first one that I have been able to vote in because of my age and I don’t want to make a mistake”, said Parwan Nazari, who is studying at Bamiyan University. “I think I’ll vote for Dr Abdullah, but I wanted to listen to him and also the others, this is a good opportunity. I will certainly be voting and so will all my friends, our families are very encouraging about this.”Ms Nazari and her friend, Nisa Ghaznavi, both 19, are reading English literature and both want to be journalists. “I want to find out for myself what is going on rather than just depending on social media. I want to travel as well and see other places. I want to look at the future,” says\u0026nbspMs Ghaznavi. Banen Haidari is also looking to the future, but is also deeply interested in aspects of the past. She is studying geology and architecture, and one of the key reasons for her doing so is “that”, she says, pointing at the rock niches where one of the Buddhas once stood.Aleem AghaThe Independent)They are now covered in scaffolding for buttresses. “But we are hoping that work will start, and I want to be part of a team which works on rebuilding them. I have always been interested, since I was little.”\u0026nbspAll the women in the group want\u0026nbspthe statues to be rebuilt, some not just to restore heritage, but in the hope\u0026nbspit will bring in tourists. “We need the money, and it’s always good to see foreign people,”\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspMs Ghaznavi.The women in the group are too young to have experienced Taliban atrocities firsthand, although they have\u0026nbspheard about them from their parents. None of them, however, object\u0026nbspto the Taliban forming part of a future government – “people are just tired of war”, Ms Nazari says.\u0026nbspBut the friends agree\u0026nbspwith Fatima Alizada, who warns\u0026nbspcaution:\u0026nbsp“We need to make sure that the Taliban don’t impose their old rules, that they respect the reforms which have been carried out.”Ms Alizada, 19, who is doing a course in Islamic studies and wants to be a defence lawyer, does not think the emancipation of women has gone far enough in Afghanistan. “Why haven’t we got one single woman running for the presidency?” she wants\u0026nbspto know.\u0026nbspSitting in the shade of a wall, Haji Abdullah can\u0026nbspthink of no good memories of the Taliban. “All I can recall are tortures and beatings, people being jailed, men forced not to cut their beards, so no, that was a bad time,” he says.\u0026nbspUstad Abdul Karim Khalili\u0026nbspin Bamiyan (Getty)“I remember when they blew up the Buddha. They had these big guns, they were firing from a long way away. I could see the statues getting hit, 18, 19 times, they just kept on firing at them.

The Taliban issued another threat on Friday, warning people to “stay away from the polling stations on election day”.Created with Sketch.Afghanistan war: lives of children devastated by the endless conflict Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andrew QuiltySave the Children220 Nooria*, 15 in the home her family has lived in for the past two years in Mazar-i SharifShe was forced to flee her home with her family after their town was attacked by armed groups.

We have been told that a team of hackers had been brought in by Dr Ghani’s team.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Saudis and the Emiratis feel they have been left behind despite all the money, the resources they have spent in Afghanistan helping the Taliban over the years. They want to take the peace initiative away from the Qataris if they can.”Saudi and Emirati diplomats, as well as Mr Ghani’s team, strongly denied that there has been any collusion between them during the election campaign. And no evidence has been produced to support the claims. Daud Noorzai, the president’s chief of staff, has repeatedly stressed that the Ghani campaign has been transparent and has taken the utmost care to avoid being connected with impropriety.Ahmad Wali Massoud is warning of outsider meddling (Aleem Agha)The UAE and Saudi Arabia were the only states, apart from Pakistan, which recognised the Taliban regime of Mullah Mohammad Omar as the legitimate government of Afghanistan during its five years in power.There are a large number of diplomats and officials from the kingdom, UAE and Qatar present in Kabul during the election campaign and all three states maintain a sizeable presence in the country.Five Emirati diplomats were killed in a bombing in Kandahar in 2017 when inaugurating projects in the city: the ambassador, Juma Mohammed Abdullah al-Kaabi, later died from his injuries.Donald Trump suspended the Doha talks in early September after a Taliban attack killed an American serviceman. But there is widespread expectation that they will resume, with the US president desperate to bring troops home and claim credit for ending the longest war in American history in time for his re-election bid next year.The negotiations had been held between an American team led by Zalmay Khalilzad – an Afghan-American and a former ambassador to Afghanistan – and a Taliban delegation based in Qatar and augmented by senior officials from Pakistan.On the Afghan campaign trail, talk of Taliban return idesThere has been strong criticism of the talks from various quarters. The Afghan government was excluded from them, and Khalilzad was accused of giving away too much in a draft agreement to the Talibs, without getting anything much in return.President Ghani was a vocal critic of the draft agreement. Other international politicians and officials had also cautioned against the projected deal, including senior figures in the US Congress such as Republican Lindsay Graham.“Perhaps some of the lobbying firms working for Dr Ghani in the US were one reason why Mr Khalilzad failed to deliver, we don’t know who was behind hiring these lobbyists,”\u0026nbspsaid Mr Massoud.In January the Taliban complained about a scheduled meeting in Riyadh with the Americans, claiming that the Saudis would use the opportunity to push them to talk to the Afghan government and also water down their negotiating position.A Taliban leader told Reuters at the time that “differences between Saudi Arabia and Qatar have in fact damaged our peace process. The Saudis unnecessarily put pressure on us to announce a ceasefire which even the US delegation didn’t pursue.”Shortly after the UAE and Saudi Arabia severed relations with Qatar in June 2017, leaked emails between Emirati and US diplomats revealed that the UAE was vying to be the venue for the Taliban talks in 2011, at the same time the group was setting up office in Doha.Another leaked email in January 2018 from Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to Washington, expressed the “anger” of Emirati foreign minister\u0026nbspAbdullah bin Zayed (ABZ) over the fact that Qatar had taken such a prominent role in the Taliban negotiations.Mr Massoud also claimed that there were reports that President Ghani’s team will claim victory on Sunday and declare himself winner of the election. “The other candidates would not accept this if it happens. We shall form a council to oppose it. We feel there will be fraud in this election, it is a very dangerous situation,” he said.Abdullah Abdullah, co-leader with Mr Ghani in the outgoing administration, and his main rival in the election, also maintained there is likely to be widespread voter fraud.“We have registered quite a few complaints, but this is just the tip of the iceberg”, he said. “My main concern will be that massively fraudulent elections will have an impact on the mentality of the people on whether the democratic process has been functioning or not. If there is massive fraud, and somebody is announced as a winner, this will not be accepted.”President Ghani said that he was not willing to go into another power-sharing arrangement if there was no overall majority. “Afghanistan must have one president, not two. I will not accept another national unity government. God willing I expect to win the election during the first round, I believe and trust the decision is in the hands of the Afghan people,” he stated ahead of Saturday’s vote.Raid on al-Qaeda bomb factory leaves dozens of wedding-goers deadHow a viral poem cut straight to the heart of Afghan politicsThe Afghan woman who makes her own rulesOn the Afghan campaign trail, talk of Taliban return idesMr Ghani wanted to stress: “My opponents can only challenge the election results in a court of law, not in a personal way. Our security and defence institutions are completely neutral and they are s of the law. We don’t have the same dangers and threats that we have had in previous elections.”More than 100,000 security personnel will be deployed across the country for the election, with US-led international forces providing air support. Around 29,500 polling stations have been set up in schools, mosques, hospitals and government building. But nearly 1,500 polling stations would remain closed because adequate protection could not be guaranteed.Read the first part of the Conflict Without End series here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruption the second part here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan families torn apart by deadly carnage: ‘My grandson will have to see more dead bodies when he grows up’ the third part here:\u0026nbspRaid on al-Qaeda bomb factory leaves dozens of wedding-goers dead, in latest Afghan violence​\u0026nbspand the fourth part here\u0026nbspOn the Afghan campaign trail in the shadow of the destroyed Buddhas of Bamiyan, talk of Taliban return ides​Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The least we can do is take care of those they leave behind.These failings are immoral and they are a direct assault on military effectiveness and therefore the defence of our country.Why  Because they corrode the morale of our servicemen and women.However many ultra-sophisticated aircraft carriers, F combat fighters, tanks and missiles we supply, the morale of the fighting man will always remain the cornerstone of combat power.High morale achieves miracles in battle, low morale leads to disaster and defeat.Low morale also makes people vote with their feet, signing off for civilian jobs where they will be properly looked after.This helps explain the woeful undermanning in the forces today, where recruiting has failed miserably to keep up with outflow.Yet a government that hopes to plug the gaping hole by increasing recruitment of soldiers from the Commonwealth shoots itself in both feet. It has made it virtually impossible for many recruits to be joined here by their families due to petty bureaucracy that could be overcome at a stroke.The Sun’s Never Forget Them campaign led the Government in July to create an Office for Veterans’ Affairs, with direct access to the Cabinet, with a new minister for Defence People and Veterans heading it.At the same time the PM promised the Government would: “Do all it can to support our Armed Forces from the day they enlist and for the rest of their lives.”No one expects overnight transformation.But after two months we have not heard one single new idea on tackling all of these age-old problems from the minister, Johnny Mercer.Mr Mercer is no ordinary politician. He’s a distinguished and courageous former soldier who fought in Afghanistan during three tours of duty and a man who I and many veterans admire and respect.He went “on strike” during Theresa May’s premiership in protest at the prosecution of British troops over historical allegations from the Northern Ireland campaign.Yet only last week we witnessed the opening of a murder trial against an elderly former soldier for alleged crimes in Londonderry half a century ago.Mr Mercer could not have done anything to prevent this.But he has not explained to the public how he intends to halt the disgraceful hounding of veterans through the courts in what is the greatest betrayal of their own Armed Forces by any government in history.In response to the Defence Committee report Mr Mercer tweeted: “I will offer a private informal session to the committee and update on every single issue raised.”Such discretion would be the way of a soldier but it is not what we expect from political leaders.The British public, as well as serving soldiers and veterans, are outraged by the abuse of our troops and those who have served.What we demand is to be told about solutions that will be actioned as soon as possible.Mr Mercer has experience of the issues raised in the latest report and served on the Defence Committee.Since entering Parliament in  he has campaigned energetically to sort out the plight of both servicemen and veterans, describing it as his main mission.If he was new to the forces’ problems we could understand he might need time to gain understanding and consider possible options.But he was selected because he has a deep understanding and experience and should have been able to announce his programme on day one.I worked at the centre of government for years and know the quagmire that confronts a minister trying to fight through a bureaucracy resistant to change and adept at wielding the civil service machinery that exists to frustrate progress.But Mr Mercer must find the resolve to overcome these obstacles. He should adopt Churchill’s dictum of “action this day”.There is no time for private briefings, blusterings and paralysis.Our troops are deployed on operations around the globe today. And who knows when the next intense battle will begin, whether over Russian expansion, Iranian aggression, or Chinese provocation, or something totally unforeseen We expect our fighting men and women to lay down their livesnecessary.It is vital that the Government and Mr Mercer do everything they can totheir courage and dedication in deeds as well as words.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They accurately describe hugely powerful emotions, justiably felt by millions of Leavers and brought on by those politicians blocking Brexit.In  these Remainers could have accepted defeat, as others did. Instead they sided with a minority who refused, who chose to denigrate Leavers as thick racists, who willed them on to die, who promoted baseless conspiracies to delegitimise the vote.And who would now pour petrol on this fire they have started by forcing on our riven nation a second referendum openly rigged for Remain.That’s why Leavers feel betrayed.That’s what lies behind their rage.What excuse do Remainers have for theirs  That they lost  That one man still stands inconveniently between them and their destruction of a historic democratic mandate  That’s shameful.We deplore all the hatred and any targeting of MPs.

So Richard was sat on loads of stuff with no room on the back seat and his legs were up and on the side.His knees were to the side too. And they smashed into the car.

The car park is temporarily closed.Please use other University car parks or near-by public car parks. We will issue an update in due course.A spokesman for the university added: We have temporarily closed the car park at our Tech Park on our Bognor Regis campus due to the presence of travellers.We are liaising with the Police and West Sussex County Council to take the necessary legal action to move them on.Our primary concern is for the welfare and safety of our students, staff, visitors, and close neighbours.”A Sussex Police spokeswoman said: Sussex Police were made aware on Wednesday evening of  caravans arriving at the Bognor Regis Campus of the University of Chichester.This is private land and is being dealt with by the land owners."},{"url":null,"title":"amazon brexit violent language","story":"It comes the same week MPs urged Boris Johnson to temper his political language.The blank notebook was described as a book and journal for Remainers and EU voters and was listed for £..It has a blue cover and the title is surrounded by yellow stars - similar to the flag of the European Union.The notebook comes amid uproar over the Prime Ministers use of the term Surrender Bill in how he described a new law which will force the PM to get another extension from the EUhe doesnt get a deal.The official Leave.EU twitter account said: Remainers are crying crocodile tears over Boriss language, yet Amazon is stocking and selling a notebook called My Little Book Of All The Brexiteers I Want To Stab.Does anyone from @AmazonUK care to explain why they think this is in any way acceptable One person replied: Who published this ...

Weeks later, Haris was well enough to leave intensive care.A year on, he weighs a stone, is taking his first steps and growing into the playful, cheeky boy his parents hoped for.Community worker Ellie said: “He overcame everything that was thrown at him. He never gave up.“We are a perfect little family now and it was so worth all of the fighting.”Ellie, from Birmingham, experienced frequent heavy bleeding throughout her pregnancy and was closely monitored by doctors at the city’s Heartlands Hospital.But, on July  last year, after one heavy bout of bleeding, Haris was born at  weeks — days after the legal limit for an abortion.Ellie, who has a two-year-old son, Elias, said: “He just decided he was coming. I had to push.“We had no ideahe was alive or not. I couldn’t hold him until he was ten days old. It was horrible.“We had no ideahe would make it or not.”Doctors smothered him in bubble wrap to stabilise his temperature. But Haris’s lungs were not strong enough to work alone and he was dependent on a ventilator.At two weeks, his health faded as his lungs filled with fluid.Ellie and Hassan, a roadside assistant, were taken into a room and told their son probably would not make it through the day.Ellie said: “He was really struggling to breathe and his body was shutting down.“I tried to cling on to any bit of hope but the doctors said it would probably be our last day with him.”Doctors injected him with steroids to clear the fluid from his lungs.The eight-day course saved his le and Ellie said: “When he pulled through we just couldn’t believe it. He has never stopped fighting.”At  weeks, his condition had improved and Haris was transferred to a special care ward.To celebrate this major breakthrough, the family held a special graduation ceremony. Because Haris was so small, his parents ordered his gown from a teddy bear factory.He was discharged  days later on October . But he was still very poorly and would require round-the-clock care from his parents.By March, Haris was able to breathe unaided and, in July, his parents celebrated his first birthday with another big party.He faces more health battles. A bleed on the brain threatens to leave a disability — another setback for Ellie and Hassan, who has a third son, Kaysan, nine.“It was hard to take but as long as he’s still with us and not in pain, that’s all that matters,” said Ellie. “He is a true inspiration and I am so proud of him.”The family spoke out to promote World Prematurity Day on November . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our ships were exhausted.”Mr Wallace also revealed he discovered a pilot training programme with a backlog of  trainees, meaning “we don’t have enough pilots to fly all our planes we’ve been buying”.He added: “This money will help us fix the problems in that pilot training.”Most alarming of all, Mr Wallace said he also discovered how low the Army’s ammunition stocks had got, as his successors saved cash by not replenishing them.He said: “They were never critical, but they would have got close to being a real challenge.“If you don’t have a proper funded plan to make sure that those stocks are maintained, they start to drop below.”Winning the funding battle with the Treasury was dficult, but Mr Wallace revealed: “Boris came to the rescue. He didn’t have to, but he did.”The £.bn cash injection only lasts until , when Mr Wallace admits the MoD will have to wage the same fight for more money again.But he says he won a key admission from No and No that the defence funding crisis must be solved for the long-term then too.Mr Wallace added: ““There is recognition by Boris Johnson, No and the Treasury now that in that we have to think that short termism has actually led to more expensive consequences.“Long-term financial planning alongside long-term ambitions is the way you get a best value for money, but also a modern st century Armed Forces that achieves the security of the country.”Shameful standards in barracks blocks will also benefit from the new money.The defence boss declared: “We have been housing our men and women in dilapidated, not fit for purpose accommodation. This new money is going to be focused often on things like that.”Mr Wallace also has bold plans to offer service families far better childcare to match the needs of a modern age.Mr Wallace is the first Defence Secretary to have been a regular serviceman since Harold Macmillan in the .During his eight years of service, he carried out several tours of Northern Ireland during the Troubles – meaning he knows what it likes to be on the receiving end of bad political leadership.He added: “The most precious equipment we have to defend our nation are the men and women.“If we don’t have the men and women with the right skills, with the right morale in our armed forces, we can’t deliver any real defence.“That’s why as long as I am Defence Secretary, I am determined to not overstretch them, not overspend and to be honest about what we can and can’t do to the rest of government.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It wasn’t to be.I first noticed Demi in , when she appeared in the movie Ghost, as fresh-faced, husky-voiced Molly, mourning the death of her husband Sam, played by Patrick Swayze.She looked adorable, with elfin cropped hair, little make-up and denim dungarees.Everyone wanted to look like this particularly gorgeous “girl next door” and that role catapulted her on to Hollywood’s A-list.Demi made a string of successful but rather questionable movies including Indecent Proposal, Striptease and GI Jane and demanded such high fees she was dubbed “Gimme Moore”, the sort of snarky comment that would never be made about a male actor.Her marriage to Bruce Willis made them the Brad and Angelina of their day, but just like that relationship, theirs too ended in tears and failure.Demi and Bruce went on to declare a truce and he was even at the launch of her new book in a show of support — although you do have to wonderhe had actually read what his ex had written about him.She claims that at the height of her fame he wanted her out of Hollywood so she could be a stay-at-home mum for their children.What strikes me about Demi’s story — from her being raped as a vulnerable  year old, to her complete ­mental breakdown after her marriage to Kutcher fell apart — was what a deeply unhappy le she has led.I honestly don’t know how any young girl would recover from being raped by a disgusting pervert who she claims “bought her” for a few hundred dollars from her alcoholic mother.How on Earth are you supposed to deal with such a horric betrayal from the one person who is supposed to love and protect you from harm It is very sad that Demi said she always felt that she was to blame for the appalling ordeal inflicted upon her by her mother and a man old enough to be her father.I think deep down she’s still that frightened, betrayed little girl who never thinks she is quite good enough.Demi writes movingly about being desperate to have a child with Kutcher.Shortly after their marriage she became pregnant, but tragically the baby died when she was six months pregnant.Again she blamed herself for the loss, and started drinking heavily.The relationship never really recovered. Years later ,just before the couple split, I interviewed Kutcher and it wasn’t a happy experience for all concerned.He wasn’t unpleasant, just deeply uncomfortable and clearly didn’t want to be promoting his latest project, but it was in his contract to so do.Everyone that day received monosyllabic replies and it was no surprise when the news broke shortly afterwards that his marriage to Demi had crumbled and that was when she started to really unravel.Even though on the outside Demi appeared to have everything — fame, enormous wealth, three healthy children and a handsome actor on her arm — inside she was a mass of ­anxiety and insecurities as she lurched from one crisis to the next.She came close to death a year after the split while partying with her oldest daughter Rumer. Demi suffered a seizure after taking drugs and inhaling nitrous oxide.That was a wake-up call for her to seek help and get her act together. Writing the book is apparently all part of the healing process.It won’t have been an easy read for her three grown-up daughters who, unsurprisingly, have apparently had their own issues with either substance abuse or insecurity about their bodies.I honestly do wonderanyone in Hollywood, especially those who find fame because of their good looks and winning smiles, are living happy, ­contented and fulfilled lives.It doesn’t look like it, and it’s deeply sad that a seemingly confident, extremely beautul woman such as Demi should have felt so worthless.All credit to her for coming back from the brink and having the guts to tell her story in her own words.But there is always collateral damage when you decide to be so honest, and I hope she is strong enough to weather the inevitable storms gathering on the horizon.Harry and Meghan brought out a secret weapon during their visit to South Africa and instantly blew away all the negativity and criticism they have experienced this year.With one cute smile and a whole lot of gurgles, baby Archie has completely rehabilitated his parents and shown them in a much happier and far more positive light.It is the first time we have properly seen the four month old and you do wonder why they haven’t shown him to the world before now.Everybody loves a baby, and Archie is a poppet, as well as being Harry’s absolute double.He has a sunny disposition and is obviously adored by his besotted mum and dad. The wee chap looked delighted to be on his first proper outing as a member of the royal firm.And Meghan is in her element. She appeared happy, relaxed and has managed to get her “look” just right.There were no designer frocks nor ostentatious jewellery. Instead it was all sustainable dresses, High Street shoes and lots of recycled outfits.Harry and Meghan have both shone a light on some hugely deserving causes and charities close to their hearts.They work well together, as well as being effective on their own, and it’s refreshing to hear them speak to the media like normal people, instead of the usual dry, formal speeches.It is in places such as Africa that they can both do such a lot of good and build on the pioneering charity work carried out by Harry’s late mum Princess Diana.Meghan telling young South African girls she is a woman of colour who feels like their sister means they can truly relate to her. The words were inspired and from the heart.There are rumours that in the future Harry, Meghan and Archie would spend half the year in southern Africa, and I reckon it’s a good idea.I’ve been lucky enough to visit this incredible part all of the world and it grabs you by the heart and doesn’t let go.Like Harry, I share a particular love of beautul Botswana, and would be delighted for themthey were lucky enough to set up a home from home there.They would be under much less pressure and scrutiny than here in the UK and able to lead almost normal lives should they so wish.Meanwhile Harry, Meghan – and especially Archie – continue with the charm offensive, breaking down barriers and becoming a force to be reckoned with.Diana would be very proud.Recycle your clothes instead of having wardrobes stuffed with cheap fashion.Stop buying plastic-wrapped fast food and maybe think about turning the bloody lights off when you leave a room.Just a thought . . .I HONESTLY think we are in imminent danger of completely losing our sense of humour and turning into a nation of po-faced bores.I couldn’t believe the reaction I got when I cheekily asked smouldering actor Jason Isaacshe was wearing shorts in an upcoming charity run for Great Ormond Street Hospital, and that I would happily run behind him for the view.It was a cheeky remark made to a delightfully naughty man, who I have interviewed many times.I knew he wouldn’t be offended in the least but would laugh heartily, which is exactly what happened. I also thought it was a fun way to promote a terric cause.I was astonished to be labelled “sexist” and “inappropriate”, which is completely OTT for such innocuous remarks.People really need to get things into perspective.Dan has brought us some of the top names in TV, movies and music, covered all the big award ceremonies and always delivers the most entertaining gossip.Here’s to the next decade of scoops, scandals and showbiz shenanigans.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I guess they must simply feel so threatened by us.”Students took to the streets across the globe in the hundreds of thousands today for a second wave of worldwide protests inspired by Greta demanding swt action on climate change.Fridays rallies kicked off in New Zealand, where young people marched on Parliament in Wellington, holding one of the largest protests ever held there.Organisers in the capital were forced to change their security plans to accommodate the crowds, while thousands more marched in Auckland and other parts of the country.On the other side of the planet, more than , rallied in Italys capital, Rome, where protesters held up signs with slogans such as Change the system, not the climate or just the word Future.Marches took place in about  locations across Italy, including the countrys financial hub of Milan where one banner read How dare you! the accusation Greta levelled at world leaders. "},{"url":null,"title":"men hull have biggest feet britain","story":"Shoe Zone compiled its footsie index after analysing sales data at  stores across Britain.It found overall the average size for men is nine and for women six.But when it comes to huge hoofs, Hull’s fellas are strides ahead, with nearly one in ten buying a size  or above in the last year.They are followed by blokes in Blackpool, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Birmingham, where around five per cent — one in  — buy big.At the other end of the scale, Oxford fellas buy the smallest shoes, with ten per cent taking a size six or smaller.Milton Keynes, Leicester, Sheffield and Bradford are close behind.However Milton Keynes is also where women with the biggest feet live — with  per cent buying a size eight or larger.Glaswegian lasses have the smallest tootsies of all, with  per cent a size four or below.Foot specialist Ellie Dods­worth said: “It’s always best to get properly measured to avoid musculoskeletal injuries and skin lesions.”Wearing the correct shoe size is very important for a number of things - it sufficiently supports the muscles and joints which helps to stabilise the foot.Naomi Shefford, of Shoe Zone, said: Here at Shoe Zone we were curious to see where in the UK we were selling the most of our biggest and smallest sizes.“We’ve looked at our store sales data, looking at the sales of our biggest and smallest sizes, to find out where in the UK the biggest and smallest feet actually are.Size  or more.

They will trash it for the sake of a dog whistle.”New Work and Pensions boss Thérèse Coffey blasted Labour’s completely reckless ideas to rip up the current welfare policies.She said: “This is totally irresponsible from Jeremy Corbyn - who now admits he would happily scrap financial support for vulnerable people with no plan as to what Labour would replace it with.“It’s reckless, political point scoring from a Party that spent years trapping people on benefits and holding them back from the opportunities that would help them build a better future for them and their families.“It is because of policies like Universal Credit that we have supported over .m people into work since , incomes are rising at their fastest pace in over a decade and income inequality is close to a -year low.“But we know there is more to do to make the system work better for those who need it most, and this why we have recently increased the amount people can earn before their benefits are reduced by £, a year.”Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord.

These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments.

The debate between Labour’s Paula Sherrf and Boris Johnson saw a woman MP tell a male Prime Minister she feared violence against her and plead with him to stop using inflammatory language, only to be told she’s talking humbug. The sight was a peeved Jacob Rees-Mogg sprawled across the front bench, with his nose in the air, like a Roman emperor awaiting his sedan chair. And they’re winners because they sum up the feeling those at the top of this country currently have for those who aren’t one of them: contempt. In the case of Johnson’s inner circle, contempt is being poured on Parliament, the judiciary, democracy and every voter who doesn’t want a no-deal Brexit. They even managed to show some to the Queen.    And so pleased are they with their contempt, they’re going to weaponise it in a patriots versus traitors general election to steal power. And sod the violent consequences for a hopelessly ided country they pretend they want to bring together. But this contempt at the top is not confined to Downing Street. Look at the , customers left stranded by Thomas Cook, the hundreds of thousands more whose holiday has been ruined and the , staff thrown on the dole after the firm’s collapse. We accept that in a rapidly changing world firms go to the wall. But what is unacceptable is that when it happens the bosses stuff their mouths with gold as they jump into the platinum-plated leboats. In Thomas Cook’s case, directors who took £million out of the collapsing company in the past  years as staff saw their bonuses slashed. It happens almost every time a big firm goes under because they have contempt for public opinion and the moral consequences of their actions.    The right-wing media went ballistic this week, eviscerating those Thomas Cook directors for betraying hard-working middle classes, and demanding an end to “fatcat” culture. But fatcat-ism has been going on for more than a quarter of a century, since the christening of the first one, British Gas boss Cedric Brown, whose salary went up % in the decade after Thatcher’s privatisation. Privatisations they hailed. Looking at the closed gates outside the mansions of the Thomas Cook directors you couldn’t help but be reminded of the Carillion bosses who were allowed to suck billions out of the public purse, while running a £m pension deficit and collapsing under a £m debt.

Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed he will bring a long-term end to the “inhumane” Tory welfare reform that has plunged thousands into misery.And in the short term he will pledge a £billion emergency rescue package to ditch the benefit cap and two-child limit - lting , children out of poverty. Labour will also immediately suspend all benefit sanctions while the five-week wait for first payment will be cut. And the Department for Work and Pensionswould be replaced on day one” of a Labour government with a Department for Social Security. The Mirror has campaigned to halt the rollout of UC, which has plunged thousands into debt and food banks, and replace it with a fairer system.Announcing the radical reforms on Saturday in Chingford, in the seat held by UC’s Tory pioneer Iain Duncan Smith, Mr Corbyn will say:Universal Credit has been an unmitigated disaster.   As well as being behind schedule and over-budget it is inhumane and cruel, driving people into poverty and hardship. Social security is supposed to give people dignity and respect, not punish and police them, make them wait five weeks for the first payment or fill out a four-page form to prove their child was born as a result of rape.” UC will not be axed immediately under Labour’s plans and the party has not set a deadline to do so. Instead Labour will only scrap the benefit once it has designed a replacement system “based on the principles of dignity and respect”.    But in the meantime, Labour will trigger a £billion package of emergency reforms to end the “worst aspects” of UC. These urgent measures - announced today - will: Scrap the Toriesapos two-child limit, which banned extra benefits for “third or subsequent” children born after  April . The cut hit , children in , households in its first two years. Scrap the ‘rape clause’. Under the two-child limit, women have to fill out a form to gain an exception for a child born of rape. Scrap the benefit cap. The  Tory cut limited total household benefits per year to £, . It has been blamed for social cleansing in inner-cities and % of those hit were single parents. Reduce the five-week wait for first payment. In the short term Labour would introduce an interim ‘half-month’ payment after three weeks, with the other half paid after five weeks. In the long term Labour would aim to cut the five-week wait to  days, by reforming assessment periods to make an early payment based on people’s estimated entitlement. Suspend all benefit sanctions, while designing a new system which gives “tailored support instead of “rigid requirements and punishments”. Make split payments the default for couples - with the child element always going to the ‘primary carerapos. The current one-payment system can leave domestic abuse victims trapped without cash. Change the monthly UC payment to every two weeks, over fears people were struggling to budget over a whole month. Pay the housing element directly to landlords to stop people falling into arrears. A study said this problem hit % of UC landlords. Recruit , new social security advisors to end the “digital only” approach to UC claims.    UC launched in  as a monthly payment to replace six benefits, including housing benefit and tax credits, and is claimed by .million. But ministers spent years having to improve it after it was bundled up with billions in welfare cuts - driving people to food banks and poverty. Thousands fell behind on rent and some said they turned to sex work. In recent years ministers cut the six-week wait to five, increased advance loans and offered aposrun-onapos payments to bridge the gap. But campaigners say paying people monthly and waiting five weeks for the first payment - forcing them to take out advance loans - were fundamental flaws that spelt disaster for the hard-up. Labour’s previous stance was to reform UC but a year-long party review found the brand was “toxic”. We reported talks to scrap it were under way last week.    Scrapping UC and working out a new system will be a huge challenge. Last year the National Audit Office warned there is no practical alternative to continuing with UC and £.bn had already been invested in setting it up. Labour’s replacement welfare system has not been designed yet and there is no final price tag. It will focus on three elements - dignity, universalism and ending poverty. A Labour source did not guarantee a new system would be fully established by the end of a five-year parliament but said: Social security will look completely dferent by the end of our first term. Tory Work and Pensions Secretary Thérèse Coffey tonight branded the policy “totally irresponsible”, claiming Labour had “no plan” for what UC would be replaced with. “It’s reckless, political point scoring from a Party that spent years trapping people on benefits,” the Cabinet minister said.  It is because of policies like Universal Credit that we have supported over .m people into work since , incomes are rising at their fastest pace in over a decade and income inequality is close to a -year low. But we know there is more to do to make the system work better for those who need it most. But single parents’ charity Gingerbread backed the announcement. Chief executive Victoria Benson said: It will be essential for any future government to take steps like thesewe are to loosen povertyaposs grip on huge numbers of single parents and their children.” Helen Barnard of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said: We welcome signicant reform to Universal Credit so that it is the anchor people need in hard times, but any changes need to avoid further upheaval for those who depend on it.

It is a victory for our campaign against the bloodsport, started after US dentist Walter Palmer shot Cecil the lion in . Animal welfare minister Zac Goldsmith said: “I look at the photos and it turns my stomach.” The Mirror’s images of trophy hunters posing with their quarry have sparked fury since we launched our ­campaign against the sick bloodsport. And in a bid to protect majestic beasts such as elephants, lions and other endangered wildle, the Government has announced it will discuss a ban on people bringing home the spoils of their slaughter. Mr ­Goldsmith revealed there will be an urgent consultation on ­stopping the imports of trophy hunt parts.    He also praised the Mirror for leading the fight against the horric slaughter since  when Cecil the lion was shot by ­American dentist Walter Palmer. Mr Goldsmith said: “Well done to you. Thank you to the Mirror for the campaign. It’s very good that we have now got to the point where we are going to do a ­consultation on a ban. “That, I know, is going to be widely welcomed because such vast numbers of people do care about this, particularly when you see Cecil the lion-type horror stories or celebrity hunter Melissa Bannerman smirking and gloating over the body of a dead giraffe. “I look at those photos and it turns my stomach. I will never be able to understand on any level why anybody would pay money to shoot a giraffe. It’s an ­extraordinary thing to want to do, particularly given we are in the midst of an extinction crisis.  “It’s not going to save the world or save all these endangered species but I think ­symbolically it’s important that we pursue all options.” There are around . million hunting trophies crossing borders every year, the majority going to the US. Almost , pieces have been imported to the UK over the past decade, a more than -fold increase on the previous  years. Those who defend the hunts claim killing animals benefits ­wildle as fees from the slaughter are ploughed into conservation. But a recent UN report warned the world is in danger of losing a million endangered species over the next few years.    Mr Goldsmith added: “It’s not a matter of opinion, it’s a matter of fact. If that’s not a crisis, I don’t know what is. “The idea that our ­contribution to conservation would be to go out and shoot a giraffe seems to me to be pretty extraordinary.” Since the Cecil the lion scandal, the Mirror has run a string of exposés on trophy hunting. Wealthy businessman Malcolm King was found be one of the most prolic, believed to have killed hundreds of animals. In July we revealed how sick ­Canadian couple Darren and Carolyn Carter celebrated by posing for a kiss after killing a magnicent lion. And we reported on a former British gamekeeper flogging sickening trips from his office in Glastonbury, Somerset – thought to be the last UK trophy hunting firm in operation.

That act is especially sickening when the quarry is threatened with extinction. This is why the Mirror launched a campaign to end trophy hunting. The sick “sport”usually involves corralling innocent animals into a small area and then eliminating them with high-powered rles. UK laws then allow the cowardly perpetrators to bring the animal parts back home. So we welcome the decision by ministers to launch a consultation with a view to stopping this vile trade. This is an important step forward in our campaign.    We shall hold the ministers’ feet to the fire until an outright ban is brought into place. The need for action could not be more pressing. Each year hunters import more than  animal parts into the UK. It has to stop. Credit crunch It is hard to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn’s verdict that Universal Credit has been an “unmitigated disaster”. People have been driven into poverty, left in debt and forced to turn to foodbanks.    More than £.billion of taxpayers’ money has been spent on a system that has failed in its primary purpose – to provide support for those most in need. This paper has led the fight for the Government to end this injustice. After a year-long review, Labour has made the right decision to replace it with a new system. Only then can we restore fairness and dignity to social security. Mum’s mission Prince Harry yesterday retraced his mother’s footsteps when he visited a minefield in Angola.

She was among around a thousand people who have given their lives to the holiday giant and met up yesterday to seek advice, support and comfort. And amid the grief and disbelief there was anger at the fatcat bosses who had shamelessly milked the high street favourite while it went to the wall. Laura Tremarco, , who had been with Thomas Cook Airlines and its predecessors since she was , sent a blunt message to boss Peter Fankhauser, telling him: “You have destroyed me.” Describing the moment she heard the news of the collapse on Monday, the cabin manager said: “I just broke down, I was sobbing, I am still shellshocked.”  Laura, from Liverpool and mum to Joshua, , and Olivia, seven, trained with friend Hayley Browne. She was with her as Thomas Cook went under, hitting a global workforce of ,. Hayley, , and husband Martin, , were both cabin crew. Martin said: “My we hasn’t stopped crying for five days.” The couple, of Allerton, Greater Manchester, who have daughters aged  and nine, now face a financial struggle. Like some , of Thomas Cook’s , UK staff, they will not be paid their last month’s wages on Monday. The rest have been kept on temporarily, to wind up the business. And their situation is made harder as Martin was forced to take nine months off after being diagnosed with stage three melanoma. He said: “I spent my savings and I am left with nothing.”  Martin, like many of Thomas Cook’s airline and shop workers, is furious at bosses who raked in £million between them in the past decade. His £,-a-year basic salary compared with a basic £, for group chief executive Mr Fankhauser. He said: “We had a good le but they have taken my kids’ future away.” Staff who until last weekend worked for Thomas Cook’s UK airline gathered at Manchester Airport for a meeting organised by union Unite. Many worked together for over two decades and are friends as well as colleagues. Julie Arden-Baxter, , from Chester, said: “The feeling on Monday was like a bereavement. This is all I have ever known.” For Danny Cossar, , this is a second blow. He previously worked for Monarch Airlines, which collapsed in .    Danny, from Manchester, was among cabin crew and holidaymakers “held hostage” at a Cuban hotel when Thomas Cook went under owing it money. Looking around the foyer at colleagues, he said: “They are the best people in the industry, with such passion for their customers.” Cabin crew manager Janet Thorpe also suffered a double blow. She was on a family break through the firm in Orlando, Florida, and learned on the day of the collapse the hotel had taken £ from her account. The -year-old, from Chorley, Lancs, said: “I rang them and they said it was because Thomas Cook hadn’t paid them and I was liable.” She is still coming to terms with losing her job, adding: “I can’t imagine myself doing anything . The last time I did a job interview was in .”  The meeting heard words of support from Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. But Unite’s Lawrence Chapple-Gill echoed anger at bosses’ pay, saying: “We have seen film star wages taken out of the business for what was ultimately failure.” Some of the disgust was directed at Thomas Cook Airlines chief executive Christoph Debus, who made an address at Manchester Airport on Monday. Stressing the true scale of the collapse, Betty said: “This isn’t just about , staff and , holidaymakers, the impact of this will be on millions.” Breaking off to console colleagues, she described how they would take basics like toiletries, soap and even bras on their trips to Cuba to give to hotel staff there, paid for out of their own pockets. Thomas Cook flew to four destinations in the country and its demise will have a massive impact on the island’s tourism industry – as it will on countless other places around the world.

She said a granite ‘sub-base’ has been used to raise the base and headstone slightly to ensure they are not damaged during grave maintenance including grass cutting. That sub-base is used in all their memorials, she added, and has never caused an issue in any other cemetery - whether council or church-run. Ingrid added: “For many people putting up a headstone is part of the closure they need. Now they’re being told they have to lower it. If the Council had a query over this gravestone they should have rung us and raised it before they passed it.”    She said that the plan for the grave, which included the gravestone, base and sub-base, and a cheque, was sent to Mid and East Antrim Council on July . When they ed from the Twelfth fortnight - the annual Northern Irish holiday - on July , the permit was waiting for them. However, she says they were rang by the Council around two weeks ago to be told the headstone was “way over the limit” of cm. Kirkwoods said the total height of the memorial, the headstone and the base, is cs, but the total height is cms when the sub-base is added in.

Ashan Corrickaposs remarkably long run of good health came to an end when he started suffering from a headache. Two days later he went to Southmead Hospital in Bristol and was told he had incurable stage-four brain cancer.The devastating diagnosis came as his sister was battling a burst fallopian tube and his mum was dealing with leukaemia, Bristol Post reported. The -year-oldaposs family have rallied around him, refusing to accept his prognosis and raising money for treatment.   His twin brother Aysa, who is fighting a boxing match as part of a bid to raise £,, said: A lot of our family have suffered from cancer. To hear that word said about Ashan shook us. “That was the biggest shock. It had always been older relatives who had it before him. Ashan has never been ill in his whole le. “Sometimes it was annoying that nothing affected him. He’s so laid back he’s almost horizontal. “Then something like this happens and it’s so sad.” Just months before doctors gave him the grave diagnosis Ashan had set up a home improvements company, which had been flourishing. “It was constant and paracetamol wasn’t working, he said of his headache. It was only a seven out of , but it wasn’t going away. “I drove myself to Southmead and they gave me a scan. Then when I was in the waiting room, a woman came out and said she had found something.    “A dark mass in the brain was mentioned. I had to stay in overnight, but I didn’t think it was going to be that serious. “The next day they operated on me. It was only five minutes before the op that they told me, almost in a passing way, it was cancerous.” The surgeon removed a glioblastoma tumour from his brain, but was not able to remove the cancerous cells which were deeply embedded. “When I came back around, the conversation about it being cancerous still hadn’t really registered, Ashan said. I thought I was fine. Aysa added: “We could tell he genuinely didn’t understand. Four days after surgery Ashan was discharged. It was only after he ed to the hospital for his results that he realised how ill he was. “They gave me a year or two with treatment,” he said. “About % of people with my condition get past the first year, % past two years and % past five years.” The dficulty of the situation was compounded by other health issues in the family. Aysa said: “Our sister was in hospital in Birmingham with an ectopic pregnancy. Her fallopian tube had burst and the doctors said it was the first time they had seen that. Thankfully she is OK now.    “Our mum has a slow-acting form of leukaemia and also had pneumonia recently. Our cousin has cancer and is going through chemo, and our aunt died from it a few years back. “It felt like a curse had come on the family.” Ashan is feeling healthy and is determined to overcome his cancer, despite doctors saying it cannot be cured.

Amiee Ward said her confidence is now at rock bottom and wishes she never underwent the procedure after being left with infected wounds on her stomach. The -year-old had visited Tinks Top to Toe Beauty parlour in Felixstowe in Suffolk, last November to receive a session of fibroblast.A handheld device, which administers a plasma flash is placed onto skin to produce a tightening effect, reducing wrinkles, stretch marks or hooded eyelids.But now almost a year on Amiee, from Suffolk, has been left with red scarring along her stomach and now wishes she embraced her female body. Amiee has three children with her husband Rick Ward, , including eight-year-old Erica, seven-year-old Alice and four-year-old Jenson.    She said: I felt so insecure about my body and because of my vanity, I have been left with all this scarring. It looks even worse than before. I wish I had just accepted my body. People should embrace the female body and be proud of their scars. My confidence is at an all time low. It has affected my marriage, I donapost want to be intimate, so Iaposm working on trying to accept my body now and embrace it. Amiee had a consultation with the salonaposs owner Gemma Richardson who reassured her of any concerns she had.    She explained: Iaposd never been there before or had the treatment before so I was a bit anxious. I met with Gemma and spoke about any concerns I had and set a time to go in and have it done. When I was having it done, the whole room stunk of burning flesh and it was really painful. She did say during the consultation that it would be relatively painless procedure so I was not expecting the pain. Afterwards I had to pick my son up and my friend said: aposOh my God you look ill, sit down.apos I just knew something wasnapost right. I have got a really high pain threshold- Iaposve got a lot of tattoos in lots of dferent areas. It was worse than childbirth.  Amiee said she sent ious photos to Gemma of her stomach through the dferent stages and said initially they were in regular contact with each other. She added: It just wasnapost getting better. She said the redness should go down and the scabs would drop of. Everything I was told to expect didnapost happen. It was a bit worrying because I didnapost know anything about the procedure. The salon talked Amiee through an aftercare routine and was told not to cover her stomach, not to get it wet and to apply cream that she bought at the salon for £. Amiee was told after  days her scabs will begin to fall off and will look normal again but said she was told it could take up to three months to fully heal. The funeral co-ordinator said: After a while it started to smell and look weird. I just knew it looked wrong and wasnapost supposed to be looking like that. Amiee claimed Gemma had started to ignore her messages and out of desperation reached out to another beautician who told her it wasnapost normal. She then visited her GP who Amiee said was outraged at her injuries and gave her a burns cream to apply to her skin. My GP couldnapost believe it. They said my stomach was severely burnt and they gave me some burns cream.

She said meeting Dianaaposs son today made her feel complete. I think I met Princess Diana on a Tuesday, she came to the centre and she wanted to see how a change of prosthetic limb was done, Sandra added. At that time I was very small, I was a very tiny girl and they started measuring my knee so they could see how the prosthetic would fit.    Princess Diana was watching this process and she started crying as she watched me getting measured for a new prosthetic. After they measured my knee we went outside and we sat by a fig tree and she was speaking to me and I felt very happy, I felt very complete to have the attention of a princess. It was an honour to be sitting next to a princess.    Diana walked through a partially cleared minefield in Angola in  to raise awareness about the issue of the weapons.She then chatted to people at an orthopaedic workshop in Luanda. Harry today opened a hospital there renamed in Dianaaposs honour.Angola pledges to invest £ million into the work of the landmine clearing charity Halo Trust.  I know you will never get your leg back, but I hope with the presidentaposs contribution...you will have some peace of mind, Harry told Sandra, who is now a mother-of-five. The mum told the duke she had five children, and the royal seemed taken aback and asked for their ages and she told him, speaking through an interpreter: I have a daughter I named her after Diana. Harry sounded a positive note, telling her: Your children will be growing up to your age and there wonapost be any landmines.

The royal was visiting the Orthopaedic Centre in Huambo, where Princess Diana had been before him in .Recently renovated, it aims to become Angola’s national centre of excellence in orthopaedic care.Speaking at a ceremony to mark the occasion, Harry described the visit as a ‘deeply personal’ one said said his mother would have been delighted to see how the hospital had developed since her visit, when it was filled with landmine victims.It has been an honour to re-trace my mother’s steps today. I lost her  years ago but her memory is with me daily and her legacy lives on. Which is why I am so happy to name this centre the Princess Diana Orthopaedic Centre.    During a tour of the centre he stopped off to view the rehabilitation room and watch led the making of prosthetic limbs in a workshop, where he met with two members who were working at the Centre when Princess Diana visited. He then sent a few minutes in the paediatric unit where he was entranced by Barnaby Jose Mar, six, who was practicing walking with the help of a double bar along with his friend Francisco Xavier, five, and carrying an Union flag. Barnaby, his mother later explained, was born with a paralysis and has trouble holding himself and controlling his limbs. But he seemed delighted to see Harry, who hunkered down on his knees to make eye contact with the little boy, before encouraging him to fist bump.    His mother said later that she was ‘incredibly shocked’ to see the prince and hadn’t known what to say. During his visit Harry also unveiled a new sign for the front of the hospital and posed with a plaque to mark his visit. The Centre, the first hospital specialising in orthopaedic rehabilitation in Angola, provides essential support to the local community and province, treating those injured by mines, accidents and affected by illnesses. Harry had an emotional meeting with a landmine victim who met Diana when she was  years old. Justina Cesar [acute accent on e] lost her right leg when she was three years old.  At the orthopaedic hospital the duke greeted her with a warm hug, and asked: “I think you were  at the time - do you remember meeting my mother ” Speaking afterwards, Ms Cesar, , said that she had no idea who Diana was when she visited the orthopaedic centre in . “People just said she was a princess. They asked us to come and meet her. But they did not say how important she was. “She greeted us, and laid her hand on my brow. I was so happy about that.

A meeting held by union bosses saw hundreds of devastated former employees speak about their financial woes after finding out they were unlikely to be paid their wages on Monday which is their pay day. According to the Daily Mail, some workers said they have had to use charity food vouchers and were relying on financial help from friends and family since they lost their jobs. The collapse of the -year-old travel firm on Monday left , workers without jobs and , Brits stranded abroad.    The government is flying back holidaymakers in the largest peacetime repatriation and will launch an inquiry into the company’s management. It comes after it emerged directors including chief executive Peter Fankhauser collectively took a £million pay packet. That included £m in bonuses despite plummeting profits. Cabin manager Laura Tremarco, , who had worked at Thomas Cook since she was , said she met Mr Fankhauser at an event several years ago saying aposhe seemed like a nice guyapos. She added: Little did we know he and the rest of them were taking these massive wages.    It is disgusting, she continued. I was supposed to get paid around £, with commission on Monday, but we’re not getting any of that. I feel so angry and sad. Part-time air hostess Betty Knight, , who has worked in the industry for almost  years, said she was heartbroken. It’s a worrying time, she added. Thomas Cook is made up predominantly of women and it is the single mothers I really feel for. It will hit so many of them so hard.’  We had pay freezes and everything down to the last paperclip was accounted for. There should be an inquiry – it stinks. For Danny Cossar, , this is a second blow. He previously worked for Monarch Airlines, which collapsed in . Danny, from Manchester, was among cabin crew and holidaymakers “held hostage” at a Cuban hotel when Thomas Cook went under owing it money. He said: “They are the best people in the industry, with such passion for their customers.”  Cabin crew manager Janet Thorpe also suffered a double blow. She was on a family break through the firm in Orlando, Florida, and learned on the day of the collapse the hotel had taken £ from her account. The -year-old, from Chorley, Lancs, said: “I rang them and they said it was because Thomas Cook hadn’t paid them and I was liable.” She is still coming to terms with losing her job, adding: “I can’t imagine myself doing anything . The last time I did a job interview was in .”  Mike Gaskell from United said: We’ve seen film star wages being taken out of a business for what ultimately was failure. People have a right to be angry. However a lawyer said that employees were in a complex legal situation and another said litigation would be expensive. James Froud, who works at law firm McCarthy Denning, said: News that Thomas Cook employees are planning legal action after losing their jobs may have buoyed some - but sadly the news is not particularly good for them. The legal position for employees in the context of their employer becoming insolvent is complex.  Whilst they may have rights to claim unfair dismissal, to seek redundancy compensation and a aposprotective awardapos for a failure by the employer to consult with them prior to the dismissal, the value of those claims is restricted - and the way in which these claims are treatedis not generally that favourable. Ross Meadows, who is based at Oury Clark solicitors, said: The employees will have ious claims against the company, including claims for unpaid salary, benefits and notice pay statutory redundancy pay unfair dismissal and a protective award for failing to inform and consult with staff as is required in a collective redundancy situation. Unfortunately, the litigation is expensive and judgment debts are dficult to enforce against insolvent employers. Thomas Cook’s collapse is also prove a massive blow to high streets across the UK as it had around  branches.

Areas such as Devon and Cornwall could see coastal gales of up to mph plus rainfall of between mm and mm.  Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield, Liverpool, Bangor, Swansea and Cardf are also covered by weather warnings issued for each day until October. Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: We have got a deep area of low pressure that will bring heavy and persistent rain, and strong winds too. In terms of rainfall totals, the greatest amounts could be up to mm. That will be over the hills and mountains. Away from there, some places could see mm to mm in a short space of time.  He said there is likely to be some disruption to travel over the weekend, with lots of spray on the roads. Mr Burkill said large waves and high spring tides could also increase the risk of coastal impact in south-west England. The inaugural Regatta London race due to take place on the River Thames on Sunday has been cancelled due to the weather warning Organisers  said the predicted stormy weather would affect the riveraposs water quality leaving them unable to safely run the event.  While the Met Office says there will be sunny spells and showers across England and Wales on Saturday morning, the bleak weather arrives in the evening. In London it will be mostly sunny on Saturday but heavy showers, thunder and winds of up to mph are forecast for Sunday. Wind and rain is forecast for the rest of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and southern Scotland throughout most of Sunday.

Sultan displayed all the qualities Conron was seeking and worked as a guide dog for a woman in Hawaii for ten years.    Later examples of the crossbreed would find themselves by the side of celebrities including actress Jenner Aniston, model Elle Macpherson, chat-show host Graham Norton, and Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson Two decades on and Wally, now , is vocal about how much he regrets his breeding ambitions.

I think we should be seeing the game out on  minutes.“That makes it even more frustrating because we need to see that last couple of minutes out.“They got back in the game – but in extra-time I thought we were the better team and we were more likely to score.“It didn’t happen and it went to penalties and we didn’t manage to win it“We’ve got another massive gameso we don’t have time to sulk or be too focused on the defeat.“It’s a huge game for the football club on Saturday and we’ve got to get on to that and focus on that.“Obviously there is disappointment on the night and the morning after when the lads wake up.“But we’ll recover and make sure we’re fully focused on the next game because there’s no real time to dwell on that.”Lewis also says Aberdeen’s penalty takers shouldn’t beat themselves up after missing in the shoot-out against Hearts.Sam Cosgrove hit his th and th goals of the season from the spot in the first half to twice put the Reds in front in the capital.But when it came to the shoot-out the English striker fired over the crossbar.Niall McGinn did likewise and Bruce Anderson’s effort was saved by Jambos keeper Joel Pereira.Lewis added: “Sam doesn’t need to beat himself up because he missed that penalty.“He scored two in the game and has scored plenty of other penalties for us.“The lads had the courage to step up and take them but unfortunately they didn’t go in.“That’s what can happen with penalties.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main Line.\"Diesel hauled trains not in a hurry already go via Dumfries so having another ersionary alternative route would not add much.\""},{"url":null,"title":"schools-sign-become-zero-waste-champions","story":"SCHOOLS from across the Borders are set to champion a zero-waste future.A total of  primary and secondary schools from

Police Scotland does not make any financial contribution to the town centre schemes.ldquoThe councilrsquos current position with regard to CCTV provision is not to install new CCTV equipment or replace le-expired systems but to continue to maintain the current asset within the existing revenue budget until they are beyond economic repair.ldquoFor information, previous work undertaken by officers in  indicated that the likely total capital cost of replacement, on a like for like basis, while utilising more modern digital technologies, could be in the region of circa pound,.ldquoThere would be potentially additional costs associated with related civils works and infrastructure in the region of pound,.ldquoA follow up report could update and validate this figure to present-day costs, however given the anticipated capital expenditure of circa poundm, plus a requirement for future on-going enhanced revenue expenditure, officers do not believe that this will provide value for money.ldquoIn addition, there is currently no identied budget, either capital or revenue.However, at a full council meeting in May, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell put forward a motion calling on officers to explore options for keeping the CCTV network, and officers have suggested a public consultation be held.The motion was agreed, and so the council will consult with ious stakeholders in the CCTV network, including Police Scotland, community councils and area partnerships, as well as providers of CCTV network systems and infrastructure to determine potential costs.The consultation will then form the basis of a series of options for CCTV in the Borders which councillors will be asked to approve, most likely in December.The councilrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon Edgar, said: ldquoWe know that CCTV can be a useful tool for the police and communities in terms of public safety.ldquoHowever, we also know that in order for the cameras to contribute to creating safe environments in our towns, the technology needs to be kept up-to-date.ldquoWith a growing demand for our services, and budget constraints, the Council must consider whether replacing the current system is value for money, and what other options are available.ldquoIn order for the council to make a fully informed decision, we need the views of the public and would encourage residents, businesses and community groups to take part in our consultation before the October  deadline.The survey is available at scotborders.citizenspace"},{"url":null,"title":"dream-wedding-dashed-thomas-cook-goes-bust","story":"A PEEBLES couple have had their dream wedding in Turkey shattered by the collapse of Thomas Cook.Groom Kevin Weir and his bride Kirsteen Barrett forked out pound, to fly their  guests to celebrate their wedding in the sun.But with only two weeks to go until they jetted off to say their vows, news that the travel firm had gone bust wrecked their plans.The distraught couplersquos wedding is now in ruins and they fear it could take months before they see a penny of their money refunded.Bride-to-be Kirsteen told us she broke down after hearing news that the travel operator had gone into liquidation this week.ldquoI just couldnrsquot believe it.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"farmer told to be of good behaviour","story":"Fergus Wilkie, , of Crossibeg Farm, had previously admitted engaging in behaviour which caused a woman fear and alarm by loitering and following her outside her place of work and in a supermarket.

I would not want to send my children through that woods lit or unlit at night and would not want to go there alone as a single person in this day and age.During the meeting, an agent for developer Cala said they could only build a footpath to the northernedge of the site where it meets land owned by Muirfield Grove residents.He said: ldquoResidents of Muirfield Grove have refused to engage with us to allow us to usethe site.ldquoIt is up to East Lothian Council to use statutory powers to developa path.However, Mr Findlay asked: ldquoAre we really in the business of enforcing residents to give up the right to their own land Martin White, from Gullane Area Community Council, urged councillors to invite the developer to take another look at the access paths from the hew housing.He said: ldquoNo path that goes by a wood, evenit is lit, is a safe path to school.ldquoWe believe the plans need more work to be done on them it is not that thorough, it is not ready and it needs to be sent back.However, Councillor Lachlan Bruce said he did not believe the path posed a danger to children.He said: ldquoI do not understand why walking by the wood would be dangerous. I walked through woods to primary school.The committee approved the conditions with an added condition which called for the developer to produce details of a footpath link to the south of the strip of

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule.

up through North Berwick Coastal Health and Wellbeing Association.Led by Deborah Ritchie and Tillie Baird, the association identied the need for this kind of project to help tackle social isolation and loneliness in the town.The project was officially launched in the summer in the community centre, with almost half of those attending signing up to volunteer.Similar projects exist in other places called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and sports clubs, emphasising community development and outreach.The project is helping tackle social isolation by encouraging GPs and other health professionals to refer those at risk of isolation to ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or all those non-medical things that might make the biggest dference to improving their health and wellbeing overall.Carol then meets the referred person to discuss their likes and dislikes, what is important to them and what the barriers are to taking part in community groups.She then puts the inidual into contact with one of her lsquocommunity connectorsrsquo related to a certain activity.Community connectors are volunteers from a iety of local groups and clubs, and people who are willing to help out in a iety of the initiativersquos smaller projects.ldquoWe are not pushing them into it, said Carol.ldquoThe connector could give them a realistic sense of what the group is like.Connectors can also volunteer their time to accompany someone, for example, to the gym on a one-off basis.Others can meet someone over a number of occasions, providing them someone to talk to over coffee.Carol has also set up smallscale cafe meetings for those who would like to meet new people.She highlighted it was not only older people who were at risk of social isolation, referring to her own experience of losing her dad and becoming a new mother soon after.She explained how the experience left her ldquocompletely wrecked and thinking that everyone around her was coping very well.She said: ldquoThere are a lot of reasons people might feel isolated at some point.ldquoIf you have been through something that is a huge setback then your confidence is that much lower.As well as mental health, other reasons people could use Community Connections could be due to accident,

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/2565902.jpg?type=article-full","title":"dominic-cummings-talks-loopholes-bypass-law-preventing-no-deal-brexit","story":"Dominic Cummings, the Prime Ministers senior adviser says that lawyers are arguing over the Benn Act, which demands that the government asks the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline.It comes as former Prime Minister John Major launched an attack on Boris Johnson - accusing him of having plans to exploit a loophole to bypass the law which forces the government to go for an extension to the October  deadlinethere is no exit deal.Mr Major said the government will use a piece of legal \"chicanery\" to by pass the bill, using the secretive body of the Privy Council to get around the law.:John Bercow promises \"creativity\" to stop forced no-dealBrexit\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit negotiations are a walk in the park, claims Dominic Cummings\",\"description\": \"Brexit negotiations are a walk in the park, claims Dominic Cummings\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media nKDYKeF poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests nKDYKeF.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Mr Cummings said last night:\"There are obviously loopholes here, because Remain lawyers are all babbling away on Twitter about the loopholes, so they say themselves that there are loopholes.\"Asked by Sky Newsthe government would obey the law, he said: \"All governments obey the law, or they try to.He said he and the prime minister are \"enjoying\" the pressure of Brexit negotiations.He said: \"We are not under pressure, the referendum was pressure.

Spending on public transport infrastructure is not cheap and the list of needs is long so it is unsurprising that there is never quite enough money to go around.In recent years, the lionrsquos share of spending has been targeted at heavy, fixed rail infrastructure such as trains, trams and subway.A total of pound.bn has been spent or committed to in an effort to modernise, increase capacity and green the system.Rail though, is the minority public transport mode compared to bus, which delivers % of public transport journeys in Scotland. In recent years, congestion, the cheap cost of car ownership and the subsidised rail network have all impacted on bus patronage.As usage has declined and operating costs rise, bus companies are increasingly at odds between what they want to deliver as a service and the need to balance the books.

Bus companies are limited in what they can do though so this infrastructure fund has come at a seminal moment for bus users and bus companies alike.The system cannot be revolutionised at the drop of a hat, so this crucial first investment in bus priority will be the acid test as to whether local authorities are willing to make the tough decisions required and whether bus can be seen as attractive enough to car users to give it a try.Poor air quality and congestion affects peoplersquos health and damages our economy. Action is needed and thanks to the Programme for Government announcement, lack of money now cannot be used as an easy excuse.As the pro-car lobby howl, local councillors worry about re-election and their own immediate job prospects.They must remember, though, that bus users wield as much power in the voting booth as car drivers and they cannot go on deferring decisions through fear.The next couple of years are going to be very interesting indeed."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10472749.jpg?type=article-full","title":"rbs-urged-end-financing-coal-oil-gas-sectors","story":"The groups from around the world, and include environmental organisations such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth as well as Christian Aid have sent an open letter to Alison Rose, the newly appointed chief executive laying out the case for her to take the radical action.The groups say an analysis shows that the taxpayer-supported banks financing of fossil fuel companies is now \"negligible\", putting putting it in a \"prime position to show real climate leadership\" by definitively ending its support for the coal, oil and gas sector.In August, RBS said it would stop financing coal-fired power plants or coalmines under a sustainability policy designed to help to tackle climate change.Projects to drill for oil in the Arctic and mining oil sands, two of the most environmentally contentious forms of oil production, also will be barred, RBS said.:We Stand Together - Thousands gather worldwide to demand climate change actionIt also said it would tighten up restrictions on lending to companies and would not provide finance to those that got more than  per cent of their revenues from thermal coalmining or coal-fired power plants, down from  per cent previously.But the groups say that RBSrsquos policy restrictions do not close off the possibility of future support for new conventional oil and gas projects or for all coal companies seeking to expand their activities.Greig Aitken, Climate campaigner at BankTrack, said: ldquoRBS fossil fuel lending might be close to nothing in practice, butthis is not translated into necessary policy changes, the bank is keeping its doors open to potential new fossil fuel finance.\"As the climate crisis intensies, and with growing global consensus that fossil fuel expansion has to end urgently, wersquore hopeful that new CEO Alison Rose will see the business and sustainability case for ending the bankrsquos fossil fuel financing, and thereby position RBS as the climate leader in the banking sector.\"Thousands of Scots joined a global climate change crusadeOn Wednesday, the Scottish Governments targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions were strengthened as MSPs voted to putdown a net-zero target in law.The Climate Change Bill - which aims to have all emissions offset by  - was passed by  votes to  at Holyrood.:Billy Connolly joins Climate Strike in GlasgowMinisters agreed to a Labour amendment to up the interim target, with members agreeing to target a % reduction by , compared with  levels.The bill sets a legally-binding \"net-zero\" target of , meaning any remaining emissions would have to be entirely offset with measures such as increased tree planting and carbon capture and storage technology.The target for Scotland is five years ahead of the date set for the whole of the UK.The groups believe that RBS, which this week became a founding signatory of the UNrsquos Principles for Responsible Banking, can now go further than its peers and lead by example.The letter to Ms Rose congratulates her on being the first woman to lead one of the UKs big four banks and states: \"With a new CEO at the helm, RBS has an opportunity to achieve another first within the UK banking sector and, indeed, the sector globally: to become the first major bank to formally end its financing for fossil fuels.\"With the climate crisis both accelerating and becoming more prominent than ever in the public consciousness, there is no time to waste and a lot to be gained by becoming a fossil free business.\"Civil society around the world recently welcomed RBSrsquos decision to rule out financing for oil and gas drilling or exploration in the endangered Arctic National Wildle Refuge.

But therersquos been a war of words doon in yonder Hoose orsquo Commons, and I have little to say about it beyond the following cogent and authoritative ndash be quiet, madam ndash observations.The stooshie ndash guid Scots word ndash thither was occasioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnsonreferring to a ldquoSurrender Act, vis-a-vis obstructive Remain legislation.The word ldquoRemain is your first clue that the subject is Brexit, and I intend dropping it as swtly as possible. In a nutshell , a referendum occurred in which one side was entirely ignorant about EU matters, did not even know who their MEP was , did not know which body sat in Brussels and which in Strasbourg, and did not know there would have to be multiple deals. And there was another side which voted to Leave.For better or worse, richer or poorer, the Leavers won, occasioning paroxysms of fury among the bourgeois elite, which pushed through the aforementioned legislation to protect our democracy from the voters.Irsquove read the words ldquoSurrender Act forwards. And, liking to be thorough, Irsquove read them backwards. And Irsquom at a loss to see how theyrsquore violent or threatening, as alleged by the opposition. There are connotations of wartime perhaps, though not necessarily so , but it still seems a relatively harmless rhetorical device, issued in the face of a clamour of abuse ndash ldquofascist! ldquodictator! the usual productsof careful analysis ndash from hate-fillGeneraled faces on the benches opposite.I think ldquobetrayal was also used, but there can hardly be a week in which it isnrsquot trotted out. In fact itrsquos one of the most routinely deployed accusations in politics.As for violent, threatening language, the opposition walked right into a trap as Borisrsquos defenders brought up numerous horrendous examples of Labour members or supporters in particular talking of ldquolynching the bitch , being admittedly ldquofull of hate, giving someone ldquoa good slapping, ldquogarrotting Danny Alexander, wanting to go back in time and ldquoassassinate Margaret Thatcher, ldquosurrendering the NHS to the US and, of course, calling everybody a Nazi.It was left to that nice man, Jeremy Corbyn , to point out that neither side had a monopoly on virtue.Fortunately, the Commons has no monopoly on Mr Johnsonrsquos time, and it was the prorogue elephantrsquos trumpeted words where that attracted my attention. In New York, for example, he made Iranrsquos President Hassan Rouhani titter by inviting him to a climate change summit in Scotland, saying: ldquoAs you know, Glasgow is lovely in November. Outrageous!Also in the US, he complained about tarfs on socks, averring that ldquosome fibres hellip have to be taken to a laboratory and set fire to twice. Incendiary stuff. On brassicas, he complained that ldquoonly certain ports in the United States are licensed for the import of British caullowers. Lucky United States.At the UN General Assembly, bewildered delegates looked nervously at each other, wonderingthey were supposed to laugh, when the PM compared performing in Parliament to Prometheus having his liver pecked out daily by an eagle. Well, itrsquos arguable, I suppose.Further adventures with words included describing some urban environments as being ldquoas antiseptic as a Zurich pharmacy, and taking the pisces out of the SNP administration in Scotland by calling it ldquofish-abandoning.However, the prize for clever deployment of words goes to the busty blonde tech entrepreneur and ex-model, with a pole-dancing pole in her flat, who described Mr Johnsonrsquos weekly visits as being for ldquotechnology lessons.Technology lessons is sure to replace ldquoUgandan relations at Private Eye as a euphemism for activities of a lewd and libidinous nature.Words, words, words.

The Red Prince told students in South Africa that he worried so much about the globersquos many ldquoissues that he found it dficult to get up. Best excuse Irsquove heard yet. Try using it with your employers next time you fancy a lie-in.After one student spoke of everyone being equal, Harryrsquos missus, Meghan, said: ldquoThat was just so meaningful, it gave me the chills. Meanwhile, Harry thumped his chest and wept: ldquoYou can feel that yoursquore speaking from here.Now, as someone who takes little interest in the monarchy beyond writing about it most weeks, I find this lurch towards Marxism-Leninism deeply discombobulating.Itrsquos dficult to imagine Queen Victoria addressing young persons and telling them wersquore all equal and should be pressing the elite to put up more windmills or eat less meat, or whatever it is, to save the environment. Similarly, Prince Albert would never have beaten his chest in such an undignied manner. For a start, there were too many jaggy medals on it.Truly, these are changed days when the royals are in the vanguard of revolution.++++CARS. Huh. Yes. What are they good for  Getting away from your family.That was one finding in a survey of driving habits conducted for Privilege Car Insurance. The car, it seems, is a sanctuary, a place to escape, a place to listen to your own sounds and let your bottom blow a raspberry without censure.Drivers spend more than two years of their lives in their vehicles. Itrsquos not time wasted. Itrsquos time to think, time to get a break from the old ball and chain ndash the mobile phone ndash and time even to have a wee sing-song without the lieges pelting your heid with rotten fruit.Less fruitfully, motorists spend three and a half weeks of their lives shouting or swearing at other drivers, and five weeks looking for a parking spot.In truth, drivingrsquos a stressful business. The best plan would be to have a car and not go anywhere in it. In Scotland, we donrsquot have cabins, huts or dachas like normal people. But parking your car somewhere nice and going there to de-stress could be the answer.Unfortunately, yoursquod have to drive to get to the car.

But the men appealed to Congress for assistance, saying they had acted in good faith and a law was ultimately passed in the US to protect whistleblowers, approved in . It is referred to as the ldquoworldrsquos first whistleblower protection law.Now itrsquos back in the spotlight The complaint that has potential to topple Mr Trump accuses the President of ldquousing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the US  election.It relates to a telephone call he had with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on July , during which Mr Trump allegedly pressed his counterpart to investigate political rival, Joe Biden.The whistleblowerrsquos identity is secret It remains so and a lawyer acting for the person has warned that trying to identy them could place them ldquoin harmrsquos way. But it has been reported they were a CIA officer.What  did the whistleblower say They were concerned that the transcript of the telephone call was not stored in the usual computer system, but was instead stored separately in a classied information file.The most famous whistleblower Has to be ldquoDeep Throat, the source for the Washington Posts Watergate scandal in the s that brought down President Richard Nixon.

Canrsquot have better testimony than that!"},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-last-upside-brexit-labour-rediscovered-soul","story":"These were once sharply-defined points on Britainrsquos political landscape by which you could set your moral compass. Then the age of Margaret Thatcher dawned and with it the worship of consumerism where a fire-sale of British assets lasting three decades created a new class of millionaires and Tory party donors. Thus, getting rich quickly and easily was regarded as a virtue and ordinary people denied the access codes saw the lights go out in their communities.The Labour Party, which had once championed these neighbourhoods, simply gave up the ghost, retiring wounded from the eternal fray after seeing the  election slip from their grasp when it had seemed theirs for the taking. This reversal was the most grievous cut of all as it seemed to signal that its own people had become mesmerised and duped by the bribes of right-to-buy and a few hundred quid from Sid at British Gas.Capitalism had won and there seemed nothing  for it but to fall in behind and loosen the bonds of Clause IV and the dreams of making the profits of industry flow to the many and not the few. The Labour party, primped up and gentried under Tony Blair was a wretched facsimile of the movement which brought the British people homes fit for habitation, free healthcare and access to university education. This one was all about appeasing high finance and the banks by withdrawing scrutiny of their misdeeds and quietly permitting Mrs Thatcherrsquos anti-trade union measures to ride.Socialism, long reviled by the right for giving the masses a glimpse of something glorious, became something pernicious and anti-patriotic once more under Mr Blair and his acolytes whose guiding principles were cashed in for a portfolio of city non-execs and the brush of ermine.In Parliament this week the left, glimpsing perhaps the downfall of a sitting Tory Prime Minister, made a graven idol of an elderly lady with a spider brooch. Later they rose up in righteous fury because Boris Johnson used words like lsquosurrenderrsquo and lsquohumbugrsquo to dismiss calls that he apologise for unlawfully proroguing parliament.This would have comforted a Tory regime which has overseen a one-sided austerity experiment a hostile environment for immigrants and refugees and tax cuts for the UKrsquos most affluent citizens and corporations. Across the UK and especially in its poorest communities thousands of families continue to suffer the effects of Mrs Thatcherrsquos social engineering.Yet here was the left being side-tracked once more, this time by the mere sounds of right-wing contempt. In future, they may come to regret that this contrived outrage at robust and plain speech from the Conservatives may undermine any attempts to express their own justiable anger over Tory attacks on the people they purport to represent.The confetti of their outrage, conveniently for the Tories, masked the messages coming out of the most important Labour Party conference in generations. At Brighton this week the party delivered several crucial policy statements that signalled to its wider membership that delivering for the many and not the few is more than just a slogan.The move to reclaim an authentic Clause IV, the momentous declaration that gives this movement its entire moral purpose, was long overdue. Before the advent of Thatcherism and the concept of profit-before-people, Clause IV was regarded as a reasonable aspiration for working class people who had been forbidden to share in the profits of their labour.ldquoTo secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service.This was a challenge to inequality and thus came to be hated by a Tory party that has always thrived on greed and corruption. Thereafter, they relied on the owners of Britainrsquos mass circulation newspapers ndash their former chums at Eton and Oxford ndash to treat this message like a contagion.The Labour conference also pledged to dismantle the UKrsquos private school system, the principal means by which its advocates ensure that fairness is always kept at a safe distance and that unearned wealth will always triumph over hard work and natural ability. Their adoption of a suite of SNP measures to help our most vulnerable citizens and already embedded in Scotlandrsquos social contracts simply underpinned theto its most sacred values.Therersquos a perverse reassurance to be had in observing the behaviour of Boris Johnson at this point when Labour has re-discovered its soul. The Prime Minister has been rebuked by some on his own side for fostering an extreme form of Toryism by casting overboard those who refuse to give him total fealty. He believes himself above the law and treats the UKrsquos democratic institutions with contempt. Accusations of corruption and conflicts of interest seem to embolden him.This has always been the Tory way this is their Clause IV: ldquoto deny the workers the full fruits of their industry and by any means necessary ndash legal or illegal ndash exerting control over each industry or service. What party did these lsquomoderatersquo Tories think they were signing up for  Just as Jeremy Corbyn is re-acquainting Labour with its core values so Mr Johnson is embracing once more the most cherished principles of Conservatism. For the first time in a generation our two main parties are playing the roles originally assigned to them by the constituencies they were sworn to protect. Let honest battle now commence.Brexit must and will happen because a clear majority of English voters committed themselves to it in a clearly-defined campaign. This also offers a stark reminder to Scots that on the most serious issues affecting their future their votes simply do not matter under our current constitutional arrangements."},{"url":null,"title":"food waste really can power cars like in the 1980s back to the future movies","story":"Just as Marty McFly and the Doc discovered in Back to the Future, our food waste can be transformed into a sustainable fuel to power future energy needs.So environmental organisation Zero Waste Scotland is using this year’s Recycle Weekto raise awareness of the potential energy that can be captured by simply placing peelings, egg shells, tea bags and any uneaten produce in household food recycling caddies.The time travelling DeLorean used in the classic s movies was modied to run on food waste – and the technology now exists to use it today to power vehicles, heat our homes and grow more food.Estimates from Zero Waste Scotland reveal that , tonnes of global warming CO equivalent gas would be saved from entering the environmenteveryone in Scotland with access to a food caddy recycled their tea bags. Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carlukegazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Wallace Day  Aug\"  Braveheart spiritlives on in Lanark viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile, a council insider accused the local authority of failing to abide by guidelines for testing the memorials.A report to this Thursday#s meeting of the Council#s Monitoring and Audit Committee has set out key findings, and has made a number of recommendations for how the programme should be improved for any future works.In all,  recommendations were made — with six described as high priority.According to an official statement from Orkney Islands Council, key findings of the report were that:The six high priority recommendations were that:According to OIC, a further five recommendations have already been progressed — these are:Additional recommendations included:According to OIC, progress in delivering and completing the actions that have been requested will be reported to future meetings.Work to re-erect headstones in Orkney#s cemeteries is continuing with five cemeteries now completed, and one more expected to be completed shortly.Work will also be getting underway to identy and make safe stones where required in the remainder of Orkney’s kirkyards as part of a continuous programme of public safety over the months and years ahead.The full report is available here  # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Files Committees-and-Agendas Monitoring-and-Audit MA MA-- I.__Burial_Grounds_Memorial_Safety__.pdf.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station. The proposed closure will have a disproportionate impact on our constituents, many of whom are not able to carry around large bags and suitcases, while they wait for their ferry or train to depart.“Even at this late stage, we hope Abellio will agree to review this decision and take steps to minimise any impact on islanders.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So when they retire the feeling of sadness is akin to a death in the family.John Humphrys of the Today programme was the irascible uncle, the kind who at dinner would be very likely to start an argument while grace was being said – but first thing in the morning his rigour and tenacity as he, metaphorically at least, pinned an evasive politician under the wheels of the radio van until the poor sap answered the question would set me up for the challenges of the day.: Jackie Bird reveals she has quit Reporting ScotlandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereBut we in Scotland are soon to suffer a loss far more grave. When we bid farewell to this bitter and isive year Jackie Bird won’t be around to point the way towards a hopefully better . Stop all the clocks. Stop them around .pm on  December. Cancel Hogmanay!Bird has fronted BBC Scotland’s Auld Year’s Night shindig since back in the auld century. If Humphrys was the grumpy uncle then she was the whoop-it-up aunt in the sparkly dress, capable of embarrassing you in your teens with slobbery festive-season kisses, but who you’d eventually come to appreciate was a good laugh and crucial to every party.Well, the party’s over. Hogmanay Live is to be revamped – it will probably get a name-change – and won’t be hosted by Bird. Unlike Humphrys who has gone willingly and was granted a long goodbye last week and one final opportunity to rough up David Cameron, Bird had rather hoped to stay involved, despite having quit newsreading duties earlier this year. But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad. Thus, not only will the door be bolted, I might have to switch off the TV as well.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp would back plan to install jeremy corbyn as temporary prime minister to halt no deal","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has given the strongest indication yet that the SNP is prepared to back Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister on a temporary basisit meant a no-deal Brexit was avoided.Senior Nationalists are concerned there is little time left before the October  deadline when the UK is scheduled to leave the EU to agree on a compromise candidate to replace Boris Johnson,the Tory leader was forced from office by a vote of no confidence.Following mounting speculation on Friday, the First Minister said she agreed with the idea of installing the Labour leader, or another candidate, as a caretaker prime minister.: Boris Johnson slams ‘inadequacies’ of SNP record in powerShe later claried that she was “open minded” about who entered No Mr Johnson was forced from office.But the Scottish Conservatives warned that any deal between Labour and the Nationalists would inevitably involve an agreement to hold a second independence referendum.The SNP leader agreed that a new PM would be required following a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson’s minority administration. They could then request a Brexit extension before calling an immediate general election.However, the plan would require support from other opposition parties in the Commons as well as the SNP to pass, including  MPs expelled by the Tories.The Liberal Democrats insisted that the numbers did not add up for Mr Corbyn to take over as prime minister.Mr Corbyn is reportedly due to meet other opposition leaders to discuss tactics on Monday after Ms Sturgeon’s test of the fragile coalition operating to prevent a no-deal Brexit.Former Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson said: “Let’s take a guess at what the SNP’s price would be for installing Corbyn in No . We know from John McDonnell that Labour would happily hand them IndyRef on a plate.”In response to a tweet making the suggestion that Mr Corbyn could enter No  to halt no deal, Ms Sturgeon said: “Agree with this. VONC , opposition unites around someone for sole purpose of securing an extension, and then immediate General Election.“Nothing is risk free but leaving Johnson in post to force through no deal - or even a bad deal - seems like a terrible idea to me.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson has maintained Britain will leave the EU on October , with or without a deal.The Benn Act, passed in Westminster earlier this month, instructs the PM to request an extension to the deadline until the end of Januaryno deal is agreed, but that is something Mr Johnson has repeatedly said he will not do.Ms Sturgeon later tweeted: “The point I’m making is not really about who it should be - I’m open minded on that - more that the opposition needs to unite behind a plan and act.”A spokesman for the SNP said: “The SNP has led the way in ensuring Brexit can be stopped and in bringing Parliament back into action after the Tories sought to shut down UK democracy, and we will continue to work with all opposition MPs to stop a no-deal Brexit and call a general election to remove this dangerous and undemocratic Prime Minister as soon as possible.“It is now possible -the political will is there - that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of Boris Johnson and his cronies, who are determined to find a way to get around the Benn Act, but is instead sent by a temporary caretaker prime minister, who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter, with an election held immediately afterwards.“We remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a no-deal Brexit and getting rid of Boris Johnson.”Scottish Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for constitutional relations Wendy Chamberlain said: “We need a plan that has a whf of a chance of working. Liberal Democrats will back a temporary government to stop a no-deal Brexit but that cannot be led by the isive Jeremy Corbyn.“The numbers don’t add up. Even Nicola Sturgeon has said that she doesn’t trust him.“Jo Swinson is working hard across parties to build a majority at Westminster to stop the damage of Brexit. Anyone who wants to keep Scotland in the UK and the UK in the EU should vote for the Liberal Democrats.”Kirstene Hair, Conservative MP for Angus, said: “This confirms what many have long suspected - SNP MPs will happily prop up Jeremy Corbyn in Number .“There is no doubt that Corbyn’s weak stance on IndyRef is a deciding factor for the nationalists.“He has already left the door open for a re-run of the  referendumhe becomes prime minister.“Only a Conservative Government will stand up for those who voted No in what was meant to be a once-in-a-generation event.”Earlier on Friday, a senior SNP source told ITV News: “It is increasingly clear that we will have to install a new prime minister via a vote of no confidence, so that we can request a delay to Brexit and hold an election,” a party source told“The convention is absolutely clear that it is the leader of the opposition - in this case Jeremy Corbyn - who should become prime minister in those circumstances.“Trying to find a compromise candidate, a national unity candidate, is too complicated, especially in the time we have. Whether people like it or not, the temporary prime minister has to be Corbyn.”The source added that the other opposition parties, and the  independent MPs, would have to come round to backing Corbyn,they want to be certain of avoiding a no deal Brexit.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has repeatedly said she would not support any deal that saw Mr Corbyn become PM.Nicola Sturgeon has previously claimed her party would explore all options to ensure the UK did not crash out of the EU.“I’ve said all along we would work across the parties to try and put a coalition together in Westminster to preferably stop Brexit altogether, but absolutely to stop a no deal Brexit,” she said last month.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why cocktail week leaves me shaken not stirred kevan christie","story":"Dark storm clouds have been gathering this week as an air of despondency lingers heavy in the atmosphere.A general sense of unease has descended across the land as we put paid to the phoney war and prepare for the great ideological battle to come, with families ided and lelong friends at each other’s throats. Traditionalists will be pitched against modernists in a battle for the heart and soul of this once great nation and institutions thought to be at the very bedrock of our civilised society will be faced with the stark choice to either embrace the future or wither on the vine, against a tidal wave of ‘progress’.I am of course talking about the momentous announcement that will see garden centre giant Dobbies team up with Edinburgh Cocktail Weekto launch their ‘brand new concept eatery’ – The Garden Hatch as part of an outdoor street-food line up. This collaboration marks a sea change for the much-loved brand and appears to be driven by modernist reformers at the company’s head office in Lasswade. I nearly choked on my blueberries when a trusted confidant pinged me an email from the PR ahead of the launch. A sample paragraph read: ‘A must-try on the menu is a Scottish twist on a Mexican classic, the ‘Scotch-os’ – Nachos with Haggis, Black Pudding, Black Beans, Cheese and Pico de Gallo – something to taco about!’This was met with my all too familiar outburst, which older colleagues have learned to ignore as younger reporters ask – ‘why is that guy shouting at his computer screen and kicking the photocopier ’Turns out Dobbies will form \u2028part of next month’s new forest-themed extension of the Cocktail Village providing pop-up bars and giving punters a dark enchanted space featuring a wigwam, forest floor, canopy and wait for it...giant toadstools under a twinkling star sky. If we tolerate this then our traybakes will be next.Dobbies have clearly been led astray here, so I forgive them but will be monitoring this situation closely and I can’t see the main faces on the Fe garden centre scene allowing this sort of hipster shenanigans to pollute the Kingdom.The real villains of the piece, however, are Edinburgh Cocktail Week and the cooncil who are trying their damndest to turn our Capital city into a year long booze-fuelled holiday resort. Ahead of the opening of that giant Johnnie Walker offie in the West End, the powers that be have granted permission for The Cocktail Village to set up camp in Festival Square and over  bars will allow you to embark on a ‘cocktail adventure’ around the city. There’s also rooftop cocktail domes at The Glasshouse Hotel which offer you an exclusive opportunity to take in views of ‘the city’s iconic skyline while snapping Instagram-worthy pictures’.... Alternatively, you can buy six cans of Carlsberg Special Brew before drinking them up Arthur’s Seat where the views are to say the least – panoramic.A wristband system will be in operation during ECW, much like the one your local swimming pool used to operate – but to my knowledge no guidelines have been issued on whether ducking or petting will be allowed. The wristbands cost £.you want to get blootered for the whole week and retail at £you just fancy a weekend sesh. Of course this will just allow you entry to the Cocktail Village and Forest and the Rooftop Cocktail Domes – the actual cocktails cost you £ a pop after you’ve bought the wristband. I’ve no doubt this celebration of idiocy will be well received among Instagram types and those who think gin was first invented in  as patrons clamour to take pictures of jet-lagged avocados and goblets of flavoured ethanol.However, the organisers of the ECW have made improvements and are obviously hoping there’s no repeat of the inaugural event two years ago when bars taking part ran dry after ,...cocktailers  – converged on the city centre. Now, I’ve been known to like a drink or  as much as the next person and although I’ve stopped I sometimes hanker for a strawberry daiquiri on a wet Tuesday afternoon in February but all of this strikes me as a bit of carry on. For a start the attraction of cocktails is that they’re easy to drink and taste like juice – a quick and easy way to get steaming while pretending you’re a celebrity. I must confess the whole thing had me a trle confused as I always thought Martini was that dodgy stuff in your mum and dad’s drinks cabinet and I could never work out why James Bond liked that. What started out as the Edinburgh Cocktail Weekend has now been extended to a week, the same one as when the local schools are on holiday which makes for an interesting clash. Drop the kids off at the museum and meet your mates for cocktails.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

I did Educating Rita at the Lyric and it felt right to perform Shirley here as well.“I was waiting to get to that right age in my career and we went into rehearsals in May. There is something about Willy Russell’s work that relates to me and to Belfast I think the humour translates exactly the same. Both Rita and Shirley have similarities, they are characters who want more,” she said.The Fall and In The Line of Duty actress said the play still has resonance today despite being written more than  years ago.“For many generations women have been told their place. Here is a woman that says ‘well this is what I want and I want to do it dferently’.”Tara spoke of how she “couldn’t wait” to work with acclaimed Tinderbox Artistic Director Patrick J O’Reilly on the production.“I knew he would bring such physicality to the piece, I never wanted it to be me playing lots of dferent people, it has to be Shirley. Patrick’s take on plays is always a little bit to the left so I couldn’t wait to see how left he would go and boy did he go left,” she laughed.“Right from the off Patrick and set and lighting designer Paul Keogan wanted the set to symbolise many things. It opens in Shirley’s kitchen, it’s stark, it’s white, it’s almost asylum like. Shirley keeps it so clean so the symbolism of her writing ‘Greece’ in huge colourful letters on a pristine white kitchen is a really beautul concept that Patrick and Paul came up with.”She continued: “When Act Two opens and Shirley is in Greece, she hasn’t completely left her le behind, she’s only gone to Greece for a fortnight. Her surroundings have changed but there are remnants of her le back home still on the stage. Because you change scene doesn’t mean you have changed, that change has to come from you and I loved that premise.“At the end of the show, her husband Joe is coming over to see her and she is excited by that. Willy Russell doesn’t knowthey are getting back together but they are meeting up. The character of Shirley doesn’t blame Joe for anything that has happened – or didn’t happen in her le. They were both these hopeful people when they married and somewhere along the way le got in the way, everyone in a couple can relate to that.”The former St Genevieve’s High School student does not wear a mic during performances, which helps herbe “intimate with the whole theatre”.“The character of Shirley is a gt, I always knew she was and I think there’s a Shirley in everyone. People seem to instantly connect and understand her and that make it really lovely because then it’s just a conversation I’m having with  people a night. It’s a conversation about le, the script is poignant, it’s sad but ultimately uplting for everyone.”Shirley Valentine runs at The Lyric Theatre until October .

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"28k for woman sacked by northern ireland firm for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I was very worried that the stress could cause complications or even a miscarriage.\"We were in a very bad situation for a time and it is a great relief to me to have this all finished.\"Ms Gruzdaites case was supported by the Equality Commission. She added: \"I am very grateful to the Equality Commission for helping me.\"No woman should lose her job because she is pregnant and it is important that women challenge such treatment.\"Ms Gruzdaite and her husband Andrius Jasinevicius started work at McGrane Nurseries Ltd, a wholesale suppliers of plants, in January , and were given a blank contract to sign with no start or end dates.She believed she was coming to Northern Ireland for a permanent job but at no point was she told it was to be a seasonal job.When she announced her pregnancy and showed the appointment letter for her first antenatal appointment to one of her managers on September , , he forgot to tell the other manager about it.Ms Gruzdaite was called to a meeting on September  with both managers to explain why she had not been at work.She also told a manager on October  about a later scan appointment on October , and she was called in to a meeting about her absence on October .The tribunal found that she was unjustiably questioned about her absence on September  and October  when she had told her manager that she was off for antenatal appointments.The employer accepted that they failed to pay Ms Gruzdaite for her time off attending the antenatal appointments.The tribunal found that a manager was less friendly to Ms Gruzdaite after she announced her pregnancy.On October , while she and her husband were at that antenatal appointment, their employers held a meeting at which a group of seasonal workers were given one weeks notice of termination.The couple were subsequently called in to meet with their employers on October  and were informed of their dismissal.Other seasonal workers were kept on by the employer and carried out the duties previously performed by Laura.On that day, her manager said to her: \"You will need more days off for your pregnancy doctors appointment... you already skipped work on Wednesday when you had your ultrasound scan.\"At tribunal, Ms Gruzdaite said: \"On that day I got very upset because both of our contracts had been terminated.\"We were waiting for our child to come into this world but both of us were unemployed and had no additional income.\"When I ed to my place of work following this conversation, I felt nauseous, my hands were shaking, and I felt a dull pain and a stretching sensation in my stomach.\"The tribunal concluded the decision to terminate Ms Gruzdaites contract was tainted by discrimination in that it was connected to her pregnancy.Her dismissal was both unfair and an act of unlawful discrimination, it ruled.Dr Michael Wardlow, the chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said around a quarter of all the complaints of discrimination made to its advice line each year are to do with sex discrimination.Of those, consistently the largest number, around % of the total, are about pregnancy and maternity discrimination.Mr Wardlow said: \"It is dispiriting that we are at tribunal once again supporting another case of pregnancy discrimination.\"Im afraid this is still all too common and, in spite of the legislation being in place for more than  years, some employers still seem to be unaware of the law and the consequences of breaching it.\"Laura Gruzdaite was  weeks pregnant at the time she and her husband were dismissed.\"They had arrived in Northern Ireland ready and willing to work and have started to make their le here.\"Lauras husband has since found other work and she is caring for their baby.\"A spokesperson for McGrane Nurseries said: \"We acknowledge the findings of the Equality Commission.\"We have engaged the services of a professional HR company who are assisting us in implementing a series of policies and practices to ensure we meet the highest standards in relation to the issues highlighted in the judgment of this case.\"This situation should never have occurred. We apologise to Laura for the upset caused to both her and her family and hope that this ruling will allow them to move forward.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38538473.ece/e76dc/BINARY/lia%20Cruise%20Ship%206.jpg","title":"belfasts biggest visitor megaship msc meraviglia thats the weight of four titanics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Japan is a sports-mad country, with sumo wrestling, football, baseball and golf among those most popular. He shows himself to be among that number after reading Belfastfrom my accreditation pass.\"George Best. Rory McIlroy. Very good,\" he says.Linked only really by their birthplace and prodigious talent, Best and McIlroy are two contrasting characters to admire, but then Japan is a country where contrasts are commonplace.Arriving into Tokyo is something of a sensory overload. At this time of year you are hit first by the heat, and then the colour and noise. It feels like there is not a moment of silence for even a second of the day.Even away from the hustle and bustle of Shibuya and its famed Scramble Crossing, giant billboards hawk products in a -hour loop, while the faint clink of the pachinko machines never feels far away either. The lights of the Tokyo skyline never dim, a city that never sleeps.Go further out and the tranquillity is striking. Walking back to the hotel in Fukuoka on Thursday night, all you could hear was the sound of crickets while the many temples and shrines offer more opportunity for quiet reflection.The biggest culture shock is taking an -hour flight and being rendered illiterate.I had about six weeks to prepare for the trip, which gave Duolingo enough time to teach me to say things like, hello, goodbye, thank you and may I have but not much . And certainly not the unique alphabet.Reading kanji - incidentally done up to down rather than left to right - I imagine is something that takes years upon years.Japan may have more cities with a Michelin-starred restaurant than any other country in the world, but some of the best food here has been from the most humble-looking of exteriors.The street vendors of Yokohamas vibrant Chinatown, the Yatai markets of Fukuoka and, yesterday, a curry house with only one dish on the menu and just three tables.For less than , yen - about £. - it was as good as anything Ive had here.Other travellers are embracing the uniqueness of the culture, too - the Dunlops of Ballymoney among the contingent of Irish fans making their way out to see Rory Best, Iain Henderson, Jacob Stockdale and company.\"We arrived last Friday so weve been here for a week, we came via Hong Kong,\" said John Dunlop, who before travelling investigated ways of offsetting the carbon footprint created by his trip.\"Weve been staying in Yokohama for the first few nights, Kyoto for the next four nights. Were here in Hamamatsu today and were finishing up with three nights in Tokyo.\"Weve not done the same thing at any stage. Weve done the sumo wrestling. Weve done a temple, weve done a car factory, Hiroshima.\"Its funny, we met another group of people from Ballymoney on Sunday at the game, it turned out she worked with my sister-in-law. Then were going for a hike miles and miles away the next day and saw them there too. Small world and all that!\"\"Its fabulous,\" added Janice Dunlop. \"Wed recommend it to anyone.

We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"global climate strike wonderful thing see new generation rise","story":"Young people took to the streets of Derry over the weekend to demand action against climate change.Hundreds of Derry students left school on Friday as part of a global climate strike to sound the alarm about what is widely viewed as an “environmental emergency”.And again on Saturday, young people were at the centre of the Our Earth Our Future March, Rally and Gathering which retraced the original civil rights route from the Waterside to the Guildhall.At Friday’s climate strike, one organiser, Rois Hutton, told the crowd they must target political parties and people with influence to insist upon \"radical quick changes\" so that \"we can ensure the survival of the human race.”Another of those behind the strike action, Emma Farren, said that this strike dfered from those held on previous occasions because adults had taken a stand alongside the youth of the city.She urged those in attendance to continue to stand with them to bring about meaningful change.Their actions prompted veteran civil rights activist, Eamonn McCann, to declare on Saturday that in all his years of campaigning he has never been more \"hopeful\".\"What made me hopeful is the composition of the marches. The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the

However, our initial assessment is that while this was not a viable device, it is clear that this is a component that could have been part of something more sinister.He added: ldquoWe know that the vast majority of people support our police officers and simply want to live in a peaceful society.ldquoWe will continue to work with communities to disrupt the activities of the small group of people who are intent on using violence.Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis said he was shocked by the discovery and praised ldquothe quick and efficient response of local police who sealed off the area.ldquoI commend the diligence of the local resident who spotted the device and altered emergency services, he said.Cllr Lewis called for a police investigation into republican terrorist activity in South Down.ldquoThe discovery of the mortar bomb on Thursday should concern every law abiding citizen of South Down and beyond, he said.This isn`t an isolated incident and is yet another indication of republican terrorist activity in the South Down area.ldquoI will be meeting with the PSNI next week to raise the concerns of the local community at the increased level of republican terrorist activity in South Down.ldquoI believe that there is a clear need for an increase in police patrols within the area and increased vigilance from the public.

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class.

Several of them would be subjected to severe political pressurethey made a decision to close on Monday.At the outset of the discussion the boardrsquos chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, said he did not wish to open debate on the already widely discussed issue. The allocation of exceptional holidays remained a matter of departmental policy whatever board members might think inidually.Mrs Ethel Smyth said the matter was causing great concern in the area and that she had already condemned Lord Elton for the action he had taken in offering Monday as an exceptional holiday.Only a native lord from England would have made such a mistake. In her view, it might have been quite proper for the Roman Catholic maintained schools take one of their ten optional days holidays to see their spiritual leader of their church.In all but one of the controlled schools in her area good sense had prevailed and those schools would remain open on Monday.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision. But it secured a reprieve as a result of pressure from local politicians, including Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.Contractors are currently hard at work restoring and extending the facility which commands spectacular views over the country park from the front of the building and Strangford Lough from the rear.Cllr Walker, who for many years has been campaigning for more investment in the country park to provide an enhanced range of attractions for visitors, said many people were looking forward to seeing the councilrsquos future vision for Delamont.He said the country park was one of the best of its kind in the province and offered ldquounlimited development potential.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoIt is important that when the vision for the future is unveiled that local people are given an opportunity to study the document and provide comment on it.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and it is important that the local council presses ahead with its own investment plan to make Delamont even better, capitalising on its huge development potential.Delamont currently operates a hugely successful miniature railway, cafe, stunning walks and childrenrsquos adventure playground, but Cllr Walker believes so much more can be done.He added: ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.ldquoSecuring finance to enhance the country park is critical to its future development and I hope others funders will join with the council on this issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Resurfacing.jpg","title":"Resurfacing work set to start in Irish Street  ","story":"WORK to resurface Irish Street in Downpatrick following the completion of a pound, public realm scheme is expected to start imminently.Roads officials have indicated that concerns about the state of a derelict building close to the townrsquos former police base have been addressed, paving the way for resurfacing work to start.It was revealed last month that the project had been delayed due to issues over insurance and that the work could not take place until these are resolved.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he has been told by roads officials that concerns about the derelict building have been ironed out and that resurfacing work will begin.Work on the regeneration project was due to be completed by March, but it was the end of June before contractors finally moved off site, with traders in the area expressing anger about the impact the delayed scheme was having on business.The delay also had a knock-on effect on traffic congestion in other parts of the town as a result of the temporary one-way traffic system in Irish Street.Managed by the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities and Newry Mourne and Down Council, the scheme has resulted in new granite paving, street lighting and street furniture.The delay in completing the public realm work within the anticipated three-month timeframe was blamed on a number of factors, described as ldquounforeseen works issues, that resulted in the loss of construction time and delays in delivering the scheme.Issues which arose included the identication of asbestos piping along both sides of Irish Street which resulted in the works contract being put on hold for eight weeks. In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town. The street has been transformed as a result of signicant investment which was long overdue.Cllr Curran said a new group was formed in July to oversee a pound, scheme to help revitalise shop fronts at Irish Street, with the so-called lsquorevitalisation fundingrsquo provided by the Department for Communities and local authority to help business owners improve the fronts of their respective properties.A working group to steer the project forward has been formed, with traders encouraged to come up with schemes to improve shop fronts.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThis is a timely initiative given what the Irish Street traders had to endure for the first six months of the year. It is also important that whatever schemes come forward that the character of this part of the town is retained.ldquoThere are also plans for an ambitious multi-million pound regeneration initiative via the redevelopment of the townrsquos former police base and a number of adjacent empty buildings.

He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.\"  \"  Supreme Court rules Boris Johnsons decision to prorogue parliament unlawful\"  \"  Jeff Dudgeon: If even Sir Anthony Hart’s inquiry into Kincora, the most rigorous yet, is not believed then we’re in a world of conspiracy theories Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was.

It doesn’t matter where the conversation begins — it always ends up in the same place.”That process had been clear since the referendum campaign. But any hope that either the passage of time or a new prime minister would see Westminsterto its historical equilibrium has not been realised..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Rather, the isions are becoming more entrenched. Some of the outworkings of that have been almost darkly comical to those familiar with Northern Ireland politics.When Boris Johnson announced a month ago that Parliament would be prorogued for five weeks, Labour shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis said that “the police will have to remove us from the chamber” evoking images of the late Ian Paisley being carried out of Stormont in  after the dissolution of the Prior Assembly.Lewis also said that “we will call on people to take to the streets”, a watered-down version of Paisley’s words the morning after being dragged out of Parliament Buildings when he warned that “there’s only one answer when you leave the ballot box — it’s a show of force” and told journalists that “this could come to hand to hand fighting in every street ... we’re on the verge of civil war”.Ultimately, Lewis voluntarily left the chamber – itself reminiscent of how some of the wilder rhetoric of Ulster’s political leaders was later quietly dropped.This week has seen ferocious linguistic warfare between the two Brexit tribes in Westminster, reflecting the fissure in the country.The Times’ experienced political editor, Francis Elliott, said of Wednesday’s parliamentary exchanges that he “cannot remember hatred being so nakedly expressed by so many and at suchacross the ide”.UTV’s veteran political editor, Ken Reid, recalled the viciousness of Belfast City Hall at the height of the Troubles, saying: “As a young reporter in the s, I watched in amazement as Belfast City Council chamber turned into a bear pit. It was nasty, hateful, threatening and without direction. Last night’s Commons row was strikingly similar. The forthcoming election could be the bitterest ever.”On Thursday night, former BBC Northern Ireland political editor Tom Kelly, who went on to work as Tony Blair’s spokesman in Downing Street, invoked another seminal moment from Northern Ireland’s history. He told The View: “I couldn’t help but be reminded of Terence O’Neill’s old phrase about ‘Ulster stands at the crossroads’. Britain’s at the crossroads...in terms of how it does politics – compromise or confrontation ”Central to Northern Irish politics is the absence of swing voters. There is no discernible cohort of the electorate who might be persuaded to move between unionist and nationalist parties based on their public spending priorities or their health policies or their plans for the education system.Arlene Foster: Brexit referendum result must be respected Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Rather, all the movement has come within the two blocs – where voters move between unionist parties or between nationalist parties – or, especially in recent years, between one of the two main tribes and the smaller centrist parties such as Alliance or the Greens.It is that factor which for decades has, with few exceptions, led to electoral reward for those seen to be robust and has punished those who are seem to be open to compromise.It is also logical for parties to overwhelmingly prioritise speaking to their own core support, rather than reaching out to an electorate which is never going to even consider voting for them.In Great Britain, that now means that the keenest battle for voters is not between Labour and the Conservatives but between the Conservatives and the Brexit Party and between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.Theresa May’s style meant that the logical extent of that truth was not explored during her time in office. But, having won the Brexit referendum in similar circumstances, Boris Johnson –and particularly Dominic Cummings – are sufficiently perceptive to realise that the next election will be won on this ground, and sufficiently ruthless to seem prepared for the revolutionary consequences of such a strategy, something at which more traditional conservatives would baulk.For now, there still are people who just want ato normality and some resolution to the Brexit impasse. But the longer that politics is ided in this way, the deeper the isions are likely to become, pushing more and more people to choose a side, thus electorally incentivising the parties to be less and less willing to compromise.Yet, for all the similarities with Northern Ireland politics, there are obvious and profound dferences. There is no religious dimension to the Brexit-Remain argument and despite the constitutional and economic signicance of EU membership, it is not as existential as the question of the very existence of the country.There are also more deeply embedded institutions in Great Britain which are both a brake on political excess and can be a cohesive force. The prorogation of Parliament for a few weeks was met with incredulity which has never manested itself in Belfast over the absence of Stormont for almost , days.The Queen is overwhelmingly respected and thereforeshe decided to address the nation at a moment of acute peril she would carry authority in a way which would not be possible in Northern Ireland.But there are other dferences which could exacerbate the deepening tribal ide. In Northern Ireland there is both a long and a recent memory of the violence which almost inevitably follows the decisive failure of politics. That can be a brake on both politicians and the public, as witnessed by the apparently renewed public acceptance of compromise in the wake of the murder of the journalist Lyra McKee in April. In England, the civil war is too distant to be a check on political disagreements.There is though some hope from Northern Ireland’s recent past. The most stable period constitutionally has been in the near decade of devolution from  to . Despite perennial crises and tribal disputes, in that time support for the status quo soared to record levels as the number of ideologues reduced in the face of a system which at least gave the appearance of working and addressing everyday needs.In that period the DUP began – at least in word – to reach out to Catholic voters in a way which would have been unthinkable, while Martin McGuinness made radical moves such as respectfully shaking hands with the Queen on multiple occasions.But as events since  have demonstrated, when deep isions are established in politics they are dficult to permanently overcome. Decisions taken for tactical party or personal advantage now could have implications for our entire political system for decades to come.try catch  TrendingThis Wrightbus worker didnt hold back when

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop. The government needs to do more to stop climate change.ldquoI donrsquot know why we have to tell them this, why donrsquot they think itrsquos important Penarth resident and leader of Wales Green Party, Anthony Slaughter, also attended the march. He said: \"The massive turnout for the climate strike march in Cardf showed the strength of feeling from all sections of our community on the ongoing crisis and the impacts already being felt across the world.\"While people of all ages were present, this was a day when young voices were prominent with speaker after speaker articulating their generations anger at government inertia. This was a day for politicians to listen and take real, meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency.\"Business as usual is no longer an option.\"The Welsh Government has declared a ldquoclimate emergency and set a target to cut carbon emission by  per cent by .Millions of people across the globe have joined the strikes, with major cities brought to a stand-still.Greta Thunberg, the -year-old who sparked the movement with a solitary protest outside Swedish parliament in August  tweeted: ldquoChange is coming. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con1.jpg","title":"us cyber security firm creating  jobs in belfast","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Alastair Hamilton and Alan Naumann A US cyber-security firm is creating  jobs with a new base in Belfast.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
